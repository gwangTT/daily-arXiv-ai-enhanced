### [1] [Imagine in Space: Exploring the Frontier of Spatial Intelligence and Reasoning Efficiency in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13782)
*Xiaoxing Lian,Aidong Yang,Jun Zhu,Peng Wang,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies weaknesses in Vision Language Models (VLMs) in spatial reasoning tasks, introduces the SpatiaLite benchmark for testing these capabilities, and proposes an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) to improve spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant limitations in the spatial reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs), which is critical for understanding perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry.

Method: Developed and implemented SpatiaLite, a synthetic benchmark designed to measure spatial reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Proposed the Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) to enhance VLM internal modeling of spatial reasoning.

Result: Findings show VLMs rely heavily on linguistic reasoning, struggle with visual-spatial tasks, and exhibit inefficiencies as task complexity grows. The proposed IDF framework hints at improving spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study highlights the spatial reasoning challenges of advanced VLMs, pinpoints performance gaps, and offers guidelines for advancing VLM architectures through an imaginative approach to internal world modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

### [2] [KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention for 3D Modeling of Complex Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13798)
*Mohammad Reza Shafie,Morteza Hajiabadi,Hamed Khosravi,Mobina Noori,Imtiaz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KANGURA is a novel 3D machine learning approach that enhances MFC anode optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art models in both benchmark datasets and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving MFC performance through better anode structure designs, which existing predictive models struggle to optimize due to complex geometric dependencies.

Method: KANGURA uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based geometry-aware representation learning, separating structural variations and employing unified attention mechanisms for 3D prediction without relying on multi-layer perceptrons.

Result: KANGURA showed superior performance compared to over 15 state-of-the-art models, achieving 92.7% accuracy in the ModelNet40 benchmark and 97% accuracy in optimizing real-world MFC anode structures.

Conclusion: KANGURA is a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, enabling effective optimization in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications, particularly for MFC improvement.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

### [3] [When AI Does Science: Evaluating the Autonomous AI Scientist KOSMOS in Radiation Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13825)
*Humza Nusrat,Omar Nusrat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the autonomous AI scientist KOSMOS on three radiation biology hypotheses, finding mixed results including one supported discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility and reliability of using autonomous AI scientists to analyze biological data and generate hypotheses.

Method: Evaluating three hypotheses in radiation biology using KOSMOS, comparing its performance against random-gene null models.

Result: One hypothesis was supported (CDO1 association with radiation response), another uncertain (12-gene signature for recurrence-free survival), and the third unsupported.

Conclusion: AI scientists like KOSMOS can generate useful ideas but need rigorous testing against null models to ensure reliability.

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

### [4] [Causal computations in Semi Markovian Structural Causal Models using divide and conquer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13852)
*Anna Rodum Bjøru,Rafael Cabañas,Helge Langseth,Antonio Salmerón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on extending a divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities to semi-Markovian structural causal models capable of representing confounding relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of previous methods restricted to Markovian models by generalizing the approach to semi-Markovian models, which represent more complex causal relationships.

Method: The methodology includes adapting the decomposition approach used for Markovian models and proposing alternative strategies for semi-Markovian models. Challenges and solutions are illustrated with examples and computational studies.

Result: The paper evaluates solution strategies theoretically and computationally, identifying methods to bound counterfactual probabilities efficiently in semi-Markovian models.

Conclusion: The study advances causal inference modeling to represent confounding relationships, opening possibilities for more accurate counterfactual analysis in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

### [5] [Jailbreaking Large Vision Language Models in Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13892)
*Badhan Chandra Das,Md Tasnim Jawad,Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) used in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), emphasizing the risks posed by jailbreaking attacks and proposing a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the security risks posed by jailbreaking attacks on LVLMs in ITS, which can lead to harmful outputs despite the models being designed to prevent inappropriate responses.

Method: The authors design a dataset with harmful queries, develop a jailbreaking attack system (image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting), and propose a multi-layered response filtering technique for defense.

Result: They evaluate attack success and the effectiveness of the defense method through GPT-4's toxicity scoring and manual verification.

Conclusion: LVLMs integrated into ITS face significant security risks from jailbreaking, but multi-layered response filtering can help mitigate those risks.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [6] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CORGI, a new algorithm for rule-based systems addressing issues of exponential time/space complexity by providing quadratic guarantees, outperforming traditional approaches like RETE in pattern matching tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in real-time applications where existing pattern-matching systems face exponential complexity, leading to memory issues and latency, particularly with rules auto-generated by AI systems.

Method: The proposed CORGI algorithm builds relations through a two-step process: forward pass for grounded relations graph construction and backward iteration for match generation without using traditional $β$-memory.

Result: Performance evaluations demonstrate CORGI's significant improvement over RETE implementations such as SOAR and OPS5 in combinatorial matching tasks.

Conclusion: CORGI offers a more practical solution for real-time rule-based systems, avoiding latency issues and memory overflows by providing quadratic guarantees in time and space, making it effective for AI-driven and database applications.

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

### [7] [Scene Graph-Guided Generative AI Framework for Synthesizing and Evaluating Industrial Hazard Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13970)
*Sanjay Acharjee,Abir Khan Ratul,Diego Patino,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative AI framework to synthesize photorealistic images of workplace hazards using structured reasoning from OSHA accident reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic datasets for training vision models on workplace hazard detection are hard to acquire due to the difficulty of capturing accident-triggering scenarios in real life.

Method: The framework analyzes OSHA narratives using GPT-4o for structured hazard reasoning, converts this into scene graphs, and uses these to guide a text-to-image diffusion model for generating realistic hazard scenes. A VQA framework evaluates the quality and accuracy of these images.

Result: The generated images were tested using a novel VQA Graph Score, which outperformed existing metrics like CLIP and BLIP, showing enhanced realism and semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: Structured AI-driven synthesis can effectively generate visually realistic and compositionally accurate hazard scenarios, advancing workplace safety modeling.

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

Motivation: To address the transition from traditional and rule-based systems to modern AI approaches in music analysis and education while emphasizing their technical, educational, and ethical impacts.

Method: The study combines a historical review, dual-case experimental validation (using generative AI in education and multiagent systems for music analysis), and comparative performance analysis.

Result: AI agents outperformed traditional methods in interpretability and adaptability, effectively boosting pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback.

Conclusion: The research underlines the importance of ethical design and responsible deployment of AI agents in music education, providing an integrative framework to guide future implementations.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrative review and experimental validation of artificial intelligence (AI) agents applied to music analysis and education. We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.
  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.
  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.

### [9] [ALEX:A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14018)
*Minghu Wang,Shuliang Zhao,Yuanyuan Zhao,Hongxia Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents ALEX, a framework designed to improve knowledge editing for Large Language Models (LLMs) by addressing scalability and efficiency issues, particularly for complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the static nature of knowledge in LLMs and the need for efficient adaptation to evolving information.

Method: The framework utilizes a hierarchical memory structure to organize edits into semantic clusters, reducing retrieval complexity. It also introduces modules for inferential query synthesis and dynamic evidence adjudication.

Result: ALEX enhances multi-hop answer accuracy and reasoning path reliability while reducing search space by over 80%, according to experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark.

Conclusion: ALEX is a promising solution for creating scalable, efficient, and accurate systems for knowledge editing in LLMs.

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

### [10] [Syn-STARTS: Synthesized START Triage Scenario Generation Framework for Scalable LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14023)
*Chiharu Hagiwara,Naoki Nonaka,Yuhta Hashimoto,Ryu Uchimido,Jun Seita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Syn-STARTS, a framework using LLMs to generate synthetic triage cases for AI development in mass casualty incidents (MCIs), demonstrating its quality and utility for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI decision-making in MCIs requires large datasets for effective development and evaluation, but real-world data accumulation is challenging due to the rarity of such events.

Method: Syn-STARTS uses large language models (LLMs) to synthetically generate triage cases, which were then benchmarked against manually curated datasets to assess quality and accuracy.

Result: Triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were indistinguishably comparable to manually curated TRIAGE datasets. Evaluation of LLM accuracy demonstrated stability across all triage categories.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generated by Syn-STARTS indicates strong potential for building AI models capable of handling critical medical situations effectively.

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

*Chandrachur Bhattacharya,Sibendu Som*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AISAC is a multi-agent system designed to streamline scientific workflows, integrating technologies like LangGraph, FAISS, and SQLite, with added focus on transparency, adaptability, and provenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance scientific and engineering workflows by creating a system that ensures transparency, provenance tracking, and adaptability across various research domains.

Method: It uses a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow, along with an Evaluator role, prompt-engineered agents, hybrid memory, incremental indexing, and a customizable project bootstrap layer.

Result: AISAC has been applied to multiple research fields such as waste-to-products, energy process safety, and general scientific assistance, showing its effectiveness in diverse scientific contexts.

Conclusion: AISAC's integration of established technologies and novel methods establishes it as a versatile tool for scientific applications with clear focus on transparency and cross-domain usability.

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

### [12] [Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14052)
*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops an instructor-controlled adaptive learning feedback loop to enhance micro-interventions using safeguards for adequacy, attention, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive learning systems often fail at timely and appropriate interventions, necessitating improved methods for personalized and equitable educational solutions.

Method: This paper proposes safeguards, formalizes intervention assignment using binary integer programming, and employs greedy selection and gradient-based relaxation algorithms for optimization.

Result: Simulations and real-world deployments in a physics course showed complete skill coverage for all learners, reduced redundancy, harmonized difficulty distribution, and effective operational scalability.

Conclusion: The system successfully closed the diagnostic-pedagogical gap with equitable, personalized solutions, enabling sustainable classroom-scale implementations.

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

### [13] [Collaborative QA using Interacting LLMs. Impact of Network Structure, Node Capability and Distributed Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14098)
*Adit Jain,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Yiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how a network of interacting language models (LLMs) collaboratively answer questions to estimate ground truth and the influence of hallucination diffusion within this network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of LLMs propagating hallucinated information in collaborative question-answering contexts, which is a challenge due to the interaction effects amplifying initial inaccuracies.

Method: They use mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and a randomized utility model from economics to model the diffusion of truthful and hallucinated states in a network of LLMs, with analytical and experimental validations.

Result: The paper establishes sufficient conditions for the LLM network's dynamics, including existence and behavior of fixed points, and conducts experiments with 100 open-source LLMs on various parameters.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical and experimental framework for understanding how interaction, structure, and incentives influence hallucination spread and collaborative accuracy in LLM networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

It dynamically utilizes various agents like OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent to automate the page design process based on user descriptions.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the RICO dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to generate superior quality layouts, showcasing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: APD-agents streamline mobile app design by utilizing a large language model-driven multi-agent system. This efficiency reduces manual effort, speeds up the process, and ensures high-quality layout generation.

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a training-free framework for financial information retrieval, utilizing advanced components like prompt engineering, in-context learning, and a multi-agent system to achieve high ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advancements in large language models and the need for efficient retrieval from lengthy financial documents make financial information extraction vital for operational and analytical decision-making.

Method: The authors propose PRISM, combining three components: refined system prompting for clear task instructions, in-context learning for few-shot examples, and a lightweight multi-agent system for coordinated scoring. The framework is modular and inference-only, allowing real-world applicability.

Result: PRISM achieves an NDCG@5 score of 0.71818 on a validation dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in document and chunk ranking for financial retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: PRISM is a feasible and robust framework for production-scale financial information retrieval, providing a practical solution with strong performance and modular design suitable for industry applications.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces R3, a dual-process framework combining lightweight expert models and large language models to enhance Vision-and-Language Navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap in VLN tasks between large language models and domain experts, while addressing issues of spatial comprehension and computational overhead.

Method: R3 integrates a lightweight transformer model (Runner), a multimodal large language model with structured reasoning (Ruminator), and a monitoring-regulatory mechanism (Regulator) to optimize navigation in VLN.

Result: R3 surpasses state-of-the-art performance on the REVERIE benchmark, exceeding metrics such as SPL by 3.28% and RGSPL by 3.30%.

Conclusion: The proposed R3 framework effectively demonstrates improvements in handling complex VLN tasks while balancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques current AI benchmarks for their focus on accuracy while ignoring enterprise factors, and introduces a new framework, CLEAR, to evaluate agents holistically for enterprise deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to address enterprise-critical requirements like cost-efficiency, reliability, and stability.

Method: They systematically analyze 12 benchmarks, run empirical evaluations, identify gaps, and create CLEAR, a new evaluation framework focusing on multidimensional metrics.

Result: CLEAR successfully predicts production success rates better than conventional accuracy-focused benchmarks, with a notable correlation improvement ($ρ=0.83$ vs $ρ=0.41$).

Conclusion: CLEAR provides a comprehensive and practical evaluation framework, demonstrating better alignment with enterprise deployment criteria and enabling cost-effective agent optimization.

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

TL;DR: HFL-FlowLLM applies large language models to improve network traffic flow classification in federated learning environments, achieving notable performance and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of high costs, privacy concerns, and poor generalization in network traffic flow classification within heterogeneous federated learning.

Method: The paper proposes HFL-FlowLLM, integrating large language models with federated learning to classify network traffic flows efficiently in distributed environments.

Result: HFL-FlowLLM enhances the average F1 score by approximately 13% compared to state-of-the-art methods, reduces training costs by 87%, and performs better with increased client participation.

Conclusion: The proposed HFL-FlowLLM framework demonstrates strong potential and practical value in improving QoS management and network security in 5G and IoT-driven environments.

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [19] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper assesses the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning about chronological tasks in finance and economics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current finance and economics applications use LLMs under the assumption that they understand and reason about chronology, which may influence the reliability of analytical results.

Method: The study evaluates different LLMs, including GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, GPT-5, with Extended Thinking (ET), and across reasoning settings applying tasks like chronological ordering, conditional sorting, and anachronism detection.

Result: Models generally struggle with maintaining globally consistent timelines, with performance dropping for longer sequences. GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking perform the best, particularly under medium/high reasoning effort. Anachronism detection proves less challenging but still shows declining performance in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Allocating explicit reasoning resources significantly improves LLMs' capability for chronological tasks, helping identify task limits and improving reproducibility for real-time financial applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

### [20] [Listen Like a Teacher: Mitigating Whisper Hallucinations using Adaptive Layer Attention and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14219)
*Kumud Tripathi,Aditya Srinivas Menon,Aman Gaurav,Raj Prakash Gohil,Pankaj Wasnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to reduce hallucination errors in the Whisper automatic speech recognition system by enhancing encoder robustness and using knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Whisper model struggles with hallucination errors, particularly in noisy conditions, and existing solutions focus on preprocessing or post-processing rather than modifying the model itself.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage architecture: 1) Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) for robust encoder representation by grouping layers and utilizing inter-layer correlations, and 2) a multi-objective knowledge distillation framework to train a student model on noisy data using clean data from a teacher model.

Result: The proposed approach reduces hallucinations and word error rates in noisy speech benchmarks while maintaining performance in clean speech settings.

Conclusion: By combining ALA and knowledge distillation, the architecture improves Whisper's reliability in noisy environments without compromising its performance on clean speech.

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in IoT recommendation models include handling complex device operation logic, user preference diversity, and resilience to suboptimal suggestions.

Method: The authors propose DevPilot using LLMs trained through domain-specific pre-training, multi-task fine-tuning, preference optimization, and a confidence-based exposure control mechanism.

Result: DevPilot outperformed baselines with a 69.5% improvement across metrics and demonstrated real-world deployment success with increased user engagement.

Conclusion: DevPilot effectively enhances IoT recommendation systems with advanced LLM techniques, proving its practical viability in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

*Hongju Lee,Youngjun Park,Jisun An,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel forecasting framework for Airbnb market indicators to assist policymakers in addressing housing market disruptions caused by short-term rentals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counteract housing affordability issues stemming from the growth of short-term rentals, accurate regional forecasts are needed to support urban policy and planning.

Method: The study uses a sliding-window time-series approach combining tabular data converted into LLM-driven embeddings with advanced models like RNN, LSTM, and Transformers to predict Airbnb indicators.

Result: Experiments on the Seoul dataset demonstrate a 48% reduction in RMSE and MAE compared to traditional statistical and ML models.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves prediction accuracy while aiding in regional impact assessments and urban policy development for Airbnb markets.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PathMind, a framework to improve knowledge graph reasoning using large language models by prioritizing important reasoning paths and reducing retrieval demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance LLM-based knowledge graph reasoning methods due to indiscriminate path extraction introducing noise and high computational demands from frequent LLM calls.

Method: PathMind employs a 'Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason' framework, including subgraph retrieval, path prioritization using semantic-aware functions, and a dual-phase training strategy.

Result: PathMind showed superior performance on benchmark datasets by accurately identifying important reasoning paths, especially in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PathMind improves both reasoning accuracy and interpretability of knowledge graph reasoning in LLM-based methods, addressing key limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing LLM-driven data insight agents, which fail due to inadequate domain knowledge integration, limited analytical depth, and error-prone code generation.

Method: The authors propose DataSage, which incorporates three innovations: external knowledge retrieval, a multi-role debating mechanism, and multi-path reasoning.

Result: DataSage consistently outperforms existing methods in automated data insight discovery as demonstrated by experiments on InsightBench.

Conclusion: DataSage is an effective and innovative solution for addressing the challenges in automated data analysis and insight discovery by leveraging multi-agent and multi-path strategies.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate executable constraint programming models from descriptions, revealing that their apparent success may be due to data contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs genuinely understand and can generate efficient models for constraint programming problems, or if their success is due to prior exposure to standard problems during training.

Method: The authors rephrased and perturbed problem descriptions from the CSPLib dataset, modifying their context and adding misleading elements, then tested three LLMs by comparing their performance on the original and modified problems.

Result: LLMs demonstrated a decline in performance when faced with modified descriptions, indicating they rely heavily on familiar contexts and exhibit sensitivity to linguistic variations rather than showing true understanding.

Conclusion: While LLMs can generate valid models for problems they recognize, they lack robust reasoning and struggle with contextually varied and novel problem descriptions.

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores how incorporating pluralistic values into the alignment of Large Language Models affects their behavior and assesses demographic variations in ratings while evaluating design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of safety and alignment in LLMs, with an overlooked aspect: the diversity of human social values and how they influence the behavior of AI systems.

Method: The authors collected alignment data involving ratings from 1,095 US and German participants, evaluated LLM responses across several dimensions, and fine-tuned models using varied demographic preferences, rating methodologies, and optimization techniques.

Result: Systematic demographic effects were observed, such as gender and racial differences in toxicity and emotional awareness ratings. Technical choices like disagreement handling and optimization techniques significantly impacted the models' alignment performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating preferences from diverse social groups in the alignment process can lead to varied model behaviors, underscoring the need to balance expert-driven signals and user-driven signals for safety and fair representation.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuro-symbolic AI framework that bridges perceptual signals and symbolic reasoning under uncertainty, demonstrating success in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect low-level continuous perceptual input with high-level discrete symbolic reasoning while accounting for uncertainty, enabling AI systems to operate effectively in uncertain environments.

Method: Combines a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural networks to extract probabilistic symbolic states and employs an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner for effective decision-making.

Result: Achieves high performance in tabletop robotic manipulation tasks with 90.7% average success across benchmarks, outperforming POMDP baselines by 10-14 points and maintaining efficient planning times.

Conclusion: This framework provides a generalizable solution for uncertainty-aware reasoning, bridging perception and planning. It shows theoretical and empirical effectiveness across uncertain environments and complex domains.

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using rate-distortion theory and optimal transport geometry to create compact and pedagogically effective knowledge graphs for generating quality MCQs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the difficulty in converting unstructured lecture materials into knowledge graphs that effectively capture key educational content for AI learning assistants.

Method: The proposed method models lecture content as a metric-measure space, uses Fused Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to align candidate graphs, and applies refinement operators to optimize the knowledge graph compactness and informativeness.

Result: The framework generates refined knowledge graphs that significantly improve the quality of multiple-choice questions on fifteen criteria compared to questions generated from unprocessed notes.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretical basis for optimizing knowledge graphs with information-theoretic principles, advancing AI-assisted personalized education.

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria.

*Jingyi Jia,Qinbin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoTool is a graph-based framework that reduces LLM inference costs in tool selection by modeling predictable sequential patterns in tool usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference cost of tool selection in LLM agents, particularly in frameworks like ReAct that invoke the LLM extensively at each step.

Method: AutoTool introduces a graph-based framework that models tool usage inertia using historical agent trajectories. Directed graphs are constructed where tools are nodes and transition probabilities are captured as edges. Parameter-level information is also integrated for enhanced tool input generation.

Result: AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates across various agent tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating statistical structures like graph-based models into LLM agent design enhances efficiency while maintaining high performance, providing a scalable solution to inference-heavy frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

### [30] [SkillGen: Learning Domain Skills for In-Context Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14670)
*Ruomeng Ding,Wei Cheng,Minglai Shao,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SkillGen, a framework for improving large language model (LLM) prompts in sequential decision-making tasks by focusing on high-utility step-wise skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations of current in-context learning (ICL) methods with LLMs, which struggle to meet three criteria (decision-focused information, step granularity, and label efficiency) in sequential tasks.

Method: SkillGen constructs action-centric domain-level graphs using sampled trajectories, applies temporal-difference credit assignment to identify high-utility actions, retrieves fine-grained skills, and generates optimized prompts.

Result: SkillGen consistently improves the progress rate in sequential tasks across tested models and domains, with gains ranging from 5.9% to 16.5%.

Conclusion: SkillGen enhances performance in sequential reasoning tasks by generating structured prompts, optimizing decision-critical information, and addressing key inefficiencies in existing ICL methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.

### [31] [Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for Power Distribution System Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14730)
*Parya Dolatyabi,Mahdi Khodayar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) using HAPPO to enable efficient and scalable restoration of power distribution systems (PDS) post large-scale outages, outperforming conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Power distribution systems restoration after outages requires addressing the complexity of constraints like power balance and operational limits, which traditional optimization methods struggle with.

Method: The paper employs Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) in HARL, training decentralized actors with centralized critics suitable for microgrid-level heterogeneities.

Result: Experiments on IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node systems show faster convergence, better restoration, and stability in multi-seed training compared to existing methods like DQN and QMIX.

Conclusion: HARL with HAPPO effectively handles microgrid heterogeneity, offering a scalable and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

Abstract: Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NL-DPE, a system designed to address limitations faced by RRAM-based IMC accelerators, achieving superior energy efficiency and speed for deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural network acceleration using RRAM-based IMC confronts challenges like restricted operations, inefficient ADCs, and inaccuracies from device imperfections, particularly as models scale.

Method: The proposed NL-DPE integrates RRAM-based Analog Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for processing complex operations while substituting ADCs with decision-tree-based transformations and incorporating a Noise Aware Fine-tuning technique.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that NL-DPE improves energy efficiency by 28X and speedup by 249X over GPUs, as well as substantial advantages over existing IMC accelerators, while sustaining accuracy.

Conclusion: NL-DPE offers a scalable and highly efficient solution for IMC acceleration, addressing crucial limitations and making the technology viable for large-scale modern ML applications.

Abstract: Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based in-memory computing (IMC) accelerators offer significant performance and energy advantages for deep neural networks (DNNs), but face three major limitations: (1) they support only \textit{static} dot-product operations and cannot accelerate arbitrary non-linear functions or data-dependent multiplications essential to modern LLMs; (2) they demand large, power-hungry analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits; and (3) mapping model weights to device conductance introduces errors from cell nonidealities. These challenges hinder scalable and accurate IMC acceleration as models grow.
  We propose NL-DPE, a Non-Linear Dot Product Engine that overcomes these barriers. NL-DPE augments crosspoint arrays with RRAM-based Analog Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) to execute arbitrary non-linear functions and data-dependent matrix multiplications in the analog domain by transforming them into decision trees, fully eliminating ADCs. To address device noise, NL-DPE uses software-based Noise Aware Fine-tuning (NAF), requiring no in-device calibration. Experiments show that NL-DPE delivers 28X energy efficiency and 249X speedup over a GPU baseline, and 22X energy efficiency and 245X speedup over existing IMC accelerators, while maintaining high accuracy.

### [33] [A Bit Level Weight Reordering Strategy Based on Column Similarity to Explore Weight Sparsity in RRAM-based NN Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14202)
*Weiping Yang,Shilin Zhou,Hui Xu,Yujiao Nie,Qimin Zhou,Zhiwei Li,Changlin Chen*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bit-level weight reordering strategy for sparse Neural Networks, optimizing mapping onto RRAM-based accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to resolve the challenge of simultaneously employing Compute-in-Memory (CIM) and weight sparsity in NN accelerators, which are traditionally incompatible.

Method: The authors propose a strategy to reorder bit-level weight matrices by identifying sparsity and similarity, removing redundancy in RRAM crossbars, and mapping compressed matrices into Operation Units (OU).

Result: Simulation results demonstrate a 61.24% performance improvement and up to 2.52x energy savings at varying sparsity ratios, with little overhead.

Conclusion: The study concludes that bit-level reordering strategy effectively bridges the gap between sparsity and structural computation in CIM, enhancing the efficiency of NN accelerators.

Abstract: Compute-in-Memory (CIM) and weight sparsity are two effective techniques to reduce data movement during Neural Network (NN) inference. However, they can hardly be employed in the same accelerator simultaneously because CIM requires structural compute patterns which are disrupted in sparse NNs. In this paper, we partially solve this issue by proposing a bit level weight reordering strategy which can realize compact mapping of sparse NN weight matrices onto Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) based NN Accelerators (RRAM-Acc). In specific, when weights are mapped to RRAM crossbars in a binary complement manner, we can observe that, which can also be mathematically proven, bit-level sparsity and similarity commonly exist in the crossbars. The bit reordering method treats bit sparsity as a special case of bit similarity, reserve only one column in a pair of columns that have identical bit values, and then map the compressed weight matrices into Operation Units (OU). The performance of our design is evaluated with typical NNs. Simulation results show a 61.24% average performance improvement and 1.51x-2.52x energy savings under different sparsity ratios, with only slight overhead compared to the state-of-the-art design.

*William Guo,Adaku Uchendu,Ana Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of watermarking techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) against adversarial attacks, focusing on preserving text quality and detecting LLM-generated texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address resistance in adopting watermarking techniques due to negative impacts on text quality and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors assess multiple watermarking techniques by comparing their robustness to adversarial attacks like paraphrasing and back translation, along with analyzing text quality and writing style using linguistic metrics.

Result: Watermarking techniques successfully preserve semantics, but deviate from original writing style and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly back translation.

Conclusion: Watermarking methods face challenges in balancing robustness to adversarial attacks and maintaining text quality, limiting their adoption for LLM text detection.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

### [36] [Can QE-informed (Re)Translation lead to Error Correction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13884)
*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two training-free approaches for Translation Quality Error Correction, with the winning method being QE-informed Retranslation achieving top scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of overcorrection in Automatic Post-Editing (APE) systems and to explore training-free alternatives for improving translation quality.

Method: Two approaches were introduced: QE-informed Retranslation selects the best translation among AI-generated candidates, while the second uses an LLM to edit error substrings based on QE explanations, utilizing a conditional heuristic for minimizing edits.

Result: QE-informed Retranslation scored 0.0201 Delta COMET, winning the leaderboard; the second approach scored -0.0108 and did not perform as well.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that QE-informed Retranslation is an effective and simple training-free approach for translation error correction, outperforming other paradigms.

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon in LLMs and introduces a benchmark dataset (GM-Extract) and evaluation metrics for retrieval performance. It further categorizes mitigation methods and provides nuanced findings on their efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face limitations in utilizing long-range context effectively, hindering retrieval applications. The paper aims to address this challenge by introducing a specialized benchmark and evaluation system.

Method: The authors introduce a novel dataset (GM-Extract) for retrieval tasks and propose two metrics to diagnose LLM failure modes: Document Metric (spatial retrieval) and Variable Extraction Metric (semantic retrieval). They also analyze models and their performance using task-specific representations.

Result: The study demonstrates that altering data representation impacts retrieval performance, observed patterns correlate with perplexity, and the efficacy of mitigation methods varies, highlighting both improvements and negative outcomes.

Conclusion: This research provides valuable insights into retrieval performance and mitigation strategies for LLMs, offering practical understanding without consistently observing a U-shaped performance curve.

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and interpretation of superlative-driven search queries in e-commerce, which require multi-dimensional attributes and linguistic semantics, addressing practical deployment constraints.

Method: Developing a framework that decomposes queries into attribute-value hints, integrated during retrieval, while transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models efficiently.

Result: The proposed method enhanced search performance by 10.9 points in MAP and 5.9 points in MRR compared to baselines while ensuring practical latencies.

Conclusion: This work advances linguistic interpretation and representation of superlative semantics in retrieval systems while balancing performance improvements and practical deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoRA-RAG, a framework that transforms unstructured post-disaster reports into reliable intelligence for hazard analysis, outperforming other models in both accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster reports are crucial for multi-hazard analysis but their unstructured format hampers systematic knowledge application. Addressing this issue with LLMs requires overcoming challenges like hallucinated outputs and lack of domain grounding.

Method: MoRA-RAG utilizes a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism for contextually coherent query handling, agentic chunking for better retrieval, and a verification loop for refining incomplete information. The HazardRecQA dataset was also constructed for testing.

Result: MoRA-RAG achieved 94.5% accuracy, surpassing zero-shot LLMs by 30% and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10%, while reducing hallucinations and allowing open-weight LLMs to perform as well as proprietary models.

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG provides a robust method to analyze post-disaster reports, establishing a paradigm shift in producing actionable intelligence from unstructured data, greatly contributing to disaster resilience and multi-hazard knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiEAG, a framework leveraging multimodal large language models to improve misinformation detection by refining checks for external consistency between image-text pairs and evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing misinformation detection methods that focus on internal consistency while ignoring the importance of external consistency checks.

Method: HiEAG employs a hierarchical approach integrating modules for evidence retrieval, reranking, and rewriting, using Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) and Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to leverage multimodal large language models for enhanced performance.

Result: Experimental results show HiEAG exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy across various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HiEAG significantly enhances external consistency checking in multimodal misinformation detection, improving overall accuracy and enabling explanations for judgments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting multiple emotions within one text is crucial, but existing datasets suffer from class imbalance, limiting model performance for underrepresented emotions.

Method: The authors built a balanced dataset using GoEmotions, additional samples from Sentiment140 processed by a RoBERTa model, and GPT-4 annotated texts. They developed a multi-label classification model using FastText embeddings, convolutional layers, bidirectional LSTM, attention mechanisms, and optimized training techniques.

Result: Their experimental evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for models trained on the balanced dataset.

Conclusion: The new dataset and model outperform existing approaches, proving the efficiency of balancing emotion categories and leveraging advanced classification architecture.

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address a critical vulnerability in Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs), which exposes attack risks through their chain-of-thought traces, presenting a safety concern.

Method: The proposed attack method, Stealth Fine-Tuning, uses segment-level interference and self-generated outputs for supervised fine-tuning. It employs a turn-based weighted loss design, ensuring lightweight and distribution-consistent fine-tuning.

Result: With just 499 samples and less than 3 hours on a single A100 GPU using QLoRA, Stealth Fine-Tuning surpasses the IDEATOR attack method by 38.52% ASR and retains general reasoning capabilities. Experimental results validate high attack effectiveness.

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning presents a significant threat to the alignment defenses of RVLMs, highlighting the need to explore and address model vulnerabilities in a responsible manner to ensure safety.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue with underrepresented ICD codes in medical datasets by generating synthetic data to improve automatic coding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of extreme long-tail distribution in diagnostic codes, which results in low performance for rare and underrepresented ICD codes.

Method: It proposes a data-centric approach by generating synthetic discharge summaries using structured prompts derived from co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes.

Result: By generating 90,000 synthetic notes with enhanced coverage of 7,902 ICD codes, the proposed framework improves macro-F1 scores while maintaining micro-F1 performance when fine-tuned on extended datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation, despite computational costs, is effective for equitable predictions in long-tail ICD code classification.

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

TL;DR: HyperABSA introduces a dynamic hypergraph framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis to efficiently predict sentiment polarity leveraging hierarchical clustering, outperforming traditional approaches across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABSA faces challenges from conflicting sentiments across aspects and sparse context in short texts, making robust prediction difficult in low-resource settings.

Method: HyperABSA employs dynamically constructed hypergraphs using hierarchical clustering. These hyperedges adaptively define aspect-opinion structures based on a granularity cutoff method.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show HyperABSA consistently outperforms graph baselines, especially when paired with RoBERTa backbones.

Conclusion: Dynamic hypergraph construction offers a robust and efficient alternative for ABSA, with potential applications to broader short-text NLP tasks.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

### [45] [Applying Relation Extraction and Graph Matching to Answering Multiple Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14144)
*Naoki Shimoda,Akihiro Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method integrating Transformer-based relation extraction with dynamic knowledge graph generation to accurately answer MCQs while providing traceability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of static knowledge graphs and leverage Transformer-based RE methods for dynamic knowledge creation and reliable application in answering MCQs.

Method: The proposed approach combines dynamic generation of relational graphs from sentences using Transformer-based RE methods and verifies truthfulness against accurate knowledge graphs under the closed-world assumption.

Result: Experimental findings show the method answers up to 70% of MCQs correctly, with accuracy varying significantly depending on the question category.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential for dynamic knowledge generation in MCQ answering and underscores the importance of question categories in influencing performance.

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

*Hao Lang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a selective W2SG framework to reduce reliance on harmful weak supervision and improve model alignment using self-generated labels and graph smoothing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing W2SG approaches depend heavily on weak supervision, which can harm model robustness, making it necessary to optimize their use for better alignment with high-performing algorithms.

Method: The authors introduce a binary classifier, P(IK), to determine when strong models can self-generate labels for alignment and refine weak labels through graph smoothing.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show consistent advancement over competitive baselines and demonstrate the generalizability of the selective W2SG framework across tasks and difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Selective W2SG improves robustness and aids in superalignment by minimizing unnecessary use of weak supervision and refining weak labels effectively.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

### [47] [SymLoc: Symbolic Localization of Hallucination across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14172)
*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a symbolic localization framework analyzing how symbolic triggers contribute to linguistic hallucinations in LLMs across all layers, revealing critical instability early on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the origins and mechanisms of symbolic hallucinations in LLMs and provide a systematic approach to handle them.

Method: The authors propose a symbolic localization framework focusing on symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge, tracing hallucinations throughout model layers using attention variance analysis.

Result: The study finds that attention variance for symbolic triggers like negation causes critical instability in earlier layers and reveals consistently high hallucination rates across models despite scaling.

Conclusion: Symbolic linguistic processing failure, not general generation issues, drives hallucinations in LLMs, and symbolic knowledge is vital for tracing and mitigating these failures.

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

### [48] [Harnessing Deep LLM Participation for Robust Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14181)
*Jiajun Hou,Chenyu Zhang,Rui Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepEL is a framework that integrates LLMs into every phase of the entity linking process, offering a self-validation mechanism for enhanced disambiguation and achieving significant improvements in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current EL approaches that utilize LLMs only in isolated stages and struggle with entity disambiguation in complex contexts.

Method: DeepEL integrates LLMs into all stages of the EL process and introduces a self-validation mechanism that uses global context to improve entity cohesiveness and prediction accuracy.

Result: DeepEL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, showing an average F1 score increase of 2.6% across benchmarks and a 4% improvement in out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Fully leveraging the capabilities of LLMs throughout the entire EL process, along with self-validation mechanisms, enables notable advancements in accuracy and robustness for entity linking tasks.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

*Ahlam Alrehili,Areej Alhothali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ArbESC+, a multi-system framework for Arabic grammatical error correction, utilizing multiple models and enhanced techniques to achieve substantial improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in Arabic grammatical error correction due to its complex morphology and syntax and improves upon previous individual model approaches by introducing a collaborative multi-system framework.

Method: The framework combines several models (AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, etc.) into a system where correction proposals are collected as numerical features. A classifier is employed to decide, filter overlapping suggestions, and improve decision reliability.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance with F0.5 scores of 82.63% on QALB-14, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 datasets, outperforming single model approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first Arab-centric attempt integrating multiple systems for grammatical error correction, marking a vital step toward advanced tools for Arabic text processing.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

*Kai Tian,Yirong Mao,Wendong Bi,Hanjie Wang,Que Wenhui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving large language models' performance in the music domain by constructing a domain-specific corpus and employing advanced training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in general tasks but fall short in specialized areas such as the music-entertainment domain, requiring better corpus quality, data-domain alignment, and training techniques.

Method: The paper introduces a music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens), employs a domain-specific data pipeline with cleaning and filtering techniques, and uses RM-based token-level soft scoring for improved training optimization.

Result: The model effectively leverages specialized music-domain data, refining training outcomes and enhancing factuality through the newly designed MusicSimpleQA benchmark.

Conclusion: This study advances large language models in the music domain by integrating scalable data pipelines, training methodologies, and evaluation frameworks, offering a strong foundation for domain-specific language models.

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

### [51] [Towards Authentic Movie Dubbing with Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14249)
*Rui Liu,Yuan Zhao,Zhenqi Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the "Authentic-Dubber" method for movie dubbing, emphasizing authentic workflows with dynamic director-actor interactions, improving emotional expressiveness in speech generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dubbing approaches miss critical director-actor dynamics, especially the emotional context grasping. This paper seeks to replicate an authentic dubbing workflow, integrating director feedback into the dubbing process.

Method: The proposed 'Authentic-Dubber' employs (1) a multimodal Reference Footage library leveraging LLMs for emotion comprehension, (2) an Emotion-Similarity-based strategy for footage retrieval, and (3) a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach incorporating emotional knowledge into dubbing.

Result: Authentic-Dubber shows significant improvements in emotional expressiveness evaluated on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset, validated through both subjective and objective assessments.

Conclusion: The proposed methodologies enable a realistic dubbing process, bridging emotional nuances into speech generation, providing a significant advancement in automatic movie dubbing systems.

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

*Gabrial Zencha Ashungafac,Mardhiyah Sanni,Busayo Awobade,Alex Gichamba,Tobi Olatunji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AfriSpeech-MultiBench, an evaluation suite for assessing over 100 African English accents across diverse domains, providing insights into the performance of multiple ASR and multimodal LLM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of application-specific model evaluation tailored to Africa's linguistic diversity, despite the growing interest in voice interfaces globally.

Method: The authors created AfriSpeech-MultiBench, an evaluation suite for African English accents. It benchmarks various speech recognition systems using diverse speech datasets covering over 100 accents, 10+ countries, and 7 domains.

Result: The study found that open-source ASR models perform well with spontaneous speech but struggle in noisy contexts, while multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet have difficulty with domain-specific terms. Proprietary models performed well on clean speech but exhibited variability by country and domain. Fine-tuned models on African English showed competitive accuracy with better latency.

Conclusion: By releasing the AfriSpeech-MultiBench benchmark, this research fosters the development and selection of inclusive voice technologies tailored to African use-cases, addressing challenges in linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

### [53] [Entropy-Guided Reasoning Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14258)
*Hourun Zhu,Yang Gao,Wenlong Fei,Jiawei Li,Huashan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-guided training framework to resolve challenges in compression training for large reasoning models, achieving significant reductions in reasoning length without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizing that the excessive length of chain-of-thought outputs from reasoning models hampers deployability and leads to high computational costs, the paper explores the entropy conflict arising from existing compression methods during training.

Method: The authors propose an entropy-guided training framework to balance efficiency and exploration. They analyzed entropy dynamics during training and developed mechanisms encouraging concise reasoning while reinforcing exploration under compact reasoning.

Result: Experiments conducted on six mathematical benchmarks demonstrated a 80% reduction in reasoning length while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Conclusion: The entropy-guided training framework resolves the entropy conflict issue, achieves efficient and robust reasoning, and provides a practical, deployable solution for shortening reasoning chains without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

*Ante Wang,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method where LLMs estimate confidence through verbalized probability distributions, encouraging deeper reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on generating verbalized confidence via large language models lacks exploration of how reasoning strategies affect confidence estimation.

Method: The proposed method involves predicting verbalized probability distributions, forcing the model to evaluate all candidates in answer space and assign confidence scores as a distribution.

Result: The method proves effective across different models and tasks, remains robust post-reinforcement learning, and aligns reasoning patterns with human expectations.

Conclusion: Estimating confidence through verbalized probability distributions enhances logical reasoning and provides consistent advantages.

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in evaluating true linguistic mastery of Arabic by providing a diagnostic framework for developers of Arabic LLMs.

Method: AraLingBench assesses LLMs through expert-designed multiple-choice questions targeting linguistic structure and deeper reasoning in Arabic.

Result: Evaluation of 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs shows proficiency at surface-level tasks but challenges in deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning.

Conclusion: AraLingBench identifies shortcomings in current LLMs, which rely on memorization or patterns rather than genuine comprehension, offering guidance for improved Arabic LLM development.

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConInstruct, a benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to detect and resolve conflicting user instructions, finding that while many LLMs excel at detection, they rarely alert users about conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how LLMs handle user instructions that include conflicting constraints, which is critical for improving the robustness of instruction-following models.

Method: The authors developed ConInstruct, a dataset designed to benchmark LLMs on conflict detection and resolution performance. They evaluated proprietary and open-source LLMs using this dataset.

Result: Most proprietary LLMs show strong conflict detection capabilities, while only DeepSeek-R1 matches their performance among open-source models. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest F1-scores. However, LLMs generally fail to explicitly notify users about conflicts or seek clarification.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have a significant shortcoming in addressing conflicting instructions, highlighting the need for advancements in this area for better user comprehension and interaction.

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper resolves issues with tokenization of chemical representations in large language models by extending vocabularies to include chemistry-specific tokens and retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with processing chemical representations like SMILES due to poorly suited tokenizers developed for general-domain text.

Method: The authors extend a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically relevant tokens and continue training it on chemistry-specific text for better integration.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved performance across various downstream chemical tasks.

Conclusion: By unifying natural language and molecular structure representations in LLMs, this methodology enhances their utility for chemical applications.

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a "tokenization bottleneck", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.

TL;DR: ATLAS proposes a cross-disciplinary, high-difficulty evaluation suite for testing Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific reasoning across complex problems, aiming to better assess frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations in existing benchmarks for LLMs, such as saturation in model performance, narrow focus, and lack of alignment with real-world scientific inquiry, motivate the development of ATLAS.

Method: ATLAS includes approximately 800 expert-developed, original, and cross-disciplinary questions across seven scientific fields, employing rigorous review, resistance to contamination, and a panel of automated LLM judges for assessing complex answers.

Result: Preliminary results show ATLAS helps differentiate the scientific reasoning abilities of leading LLMs, addressing the fidelity and complexity gaps in current evaluation methods.

Conclusion: ATLAS serves as a refined metric suite aimed at long-term assessment for AGI progress, offering a robust platform for evaluating models on advanced scientific reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

### [59] [Mitigating Label Length Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14385)
*Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses label length bias in large language models and proposes normalized contextual calibration (NCC) to improve prediction consistency and accuracy across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models suffer from label biases, particularly with multi-token class labels, impacting their performance and reliability in zero- and few-shot learning tasks.

Method: The authors introduce normalized contextual calibration (NCC), a method that adjusts predictions at the full-label level, tackling inconsistencies caused by label length bias. NCC combines bias mitigation with in-context learning strategies.

Result: NCC shows significant performance improvements, achieving gains up to 10% F1 across multiple datasets and models. It proves to be effective in tasks like multiple-choice question answering and offers reliable confidence estimates.

Conclusion: NCC addresses a critical problem of label length bias in LLMs, enhancing their robustness and real-world applicability by improving prediction calibration and reducing sensitivity to few-shot example selection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

### [60] [Unified Defense for Large Language Models against Jailbreak and Fine-Tuning Attacks in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14423)
*Xin Yi,Yue Li,Dongsheng Shi,Linlin Wang,Xiaoling Wang,Liang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies safety vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational scenarios and introduces EduHarm, a safety benchmark. It also proposes a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) to mitigate jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety challenges specific to educational scenarios, especially the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment.

Method: 1. EduHarm Benchmark: Provides safety evaluation with safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five educational scenarios. 2. Three-stage Shield Framework (TSSF): Includes safety-aware attention realignment, layer-wise safety judgment, and defense-driven dual routing to strengthen safety defenses.

Result: TSSF showed effective safety improvements across eight jailbreak attack strategies and robust resistance to fine-tuning attacks, maintaining utility for benign queries.

Conclusion: TSSF and the EduHarm benchmark enhance safety standards for educational LLMs, addressing specific vulnerabilities while maintaining performance for non-harmful inputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

TL;DR: MedBench v4, a cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure, evaluates medical AI models across specialties with expert-curated tasks, revealing performance gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety, while showcasing the effectiveness of agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an evaluation framework that reflects real-world clinical workflows and safety constraints for medical AI models.

Method: MedBench v4 uses a nationwide cloud-based system with 700,000 expert-reviewed tasks refined by clinicians. It benchmarks LLMs, multimodal models, and agents with scores calibrated to human ratings.

Result: Base LLMs scored 54.1/100 overall. Multimodal models performed worse (mean score 47.5/100), while agent models improved substantially (mean score 79.8/100).

Conclusion: MedBench v4 highlights gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety in base models but demonstrates improved clinical readiness through agent-based designs, aligning to regulatory standards for practical AI auditing.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accessible, personalized mental health resources and tools to address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data and enhance self-care solutions.

Method: The system integrates a retrieval-augmented generation assistant, synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation, and adaptive self-care planning using CrewAI.

Result: The tools developed in this study successfully improve accessibility to mental health resources, provide synthetic data for research, and offer dynamic self-care workflows. The evaluations confirm the system's efficacy through curated scenarios, LLM-based judgments, and human-user studies.

Conclusion: The system showcases how conversational AI can complement mental health care, broaden resource accessibility, and serve as a valuable space for emotional processing and interdisciplinary innovation.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of tailored RL methodologies and flexible training frameworks for LLM Agents, which limits progress in applying RL to such agents.

Method: The paper extends the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to define LLM Agent components and introduces Agent-R1, a modular and adaptable RL training framework.

Result: The study conducted experiments using Multihop QA benchmark tasks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and framework.

Conclusion: Agent-R1 is shown to be a promising tool for advancing RL-based training of LLM Agents, facilitating adaptation to various tasks and environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems due to their increasing prominence in generative AI solutions.

Method: The LiveRAG benchmark provides 895 synthetic Q&A derived from the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge dataset, augmented with ground-truth answers, supporting claims, and analysis of question difficulty via Item Response Theory.

Result: The benchmark exhibits diverse questions, a range of difficulty levels, and effectiveness in distinguishing between system capabilities.

Conclusion: The LiveRAG benchmark aims to support RAG research, enable systematic evaluation, and foster advancements in robust Q&A systems.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines methods for aligning and evaluating sets of claims extracted from documents to improve claim extraction evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional tools for assessing document-level claim extraction lack robust methods to evaluate extracted claims, especially regarding human-annotated vs model-generated claim sets.

Method: This work investigates alignment techniques for comparing claim sets by computing similarity scores and conducting experiments using claims extracted from Czech and Slovak news article comments.

Result: Results reveal limitations in current evaluation methods, emphasizing challenges like semantic similarity, atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization in claim extraction for informal language domains.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity for advanced claim evaluation approaches to address the specific demands of document-level claim extraction, particularly in informal and context-dependent settings, for reliable assessment frameworks.

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High quality summarization datasets are limited for under-represented languages, and digitized historical newspapers provide a potential data source.

Method: The authors developed automatic methods to extract naturally occurring summaries from front-page teasers across seven languages, and applied the process specifically to Hebrew newspapers.

Result: Created HEBTEASESUM, the first multi-document summarization dataset dedicated to the Hebrew language.

Conclusion: Historical newspapers are a viable resource for summarization data collection, enabling advancements in multilingual summarization research.

Abstract: High quality summarization data remains scarce in under-represented languages. However, historical newspapers, made available through recent digitization efforts, offer an abundant source of untapped, naturally annotated data. In this work, we present a novel method for collecting naturally occurring summaries via Front-Page Teasers, where editors summarize full length articles. We show that this phenomenon is common across seven diverse languages and supports multi-document summarization. To scale data collection, we develop an automatic process, suited to varying linguistic resource levels. Finally, we apply this process to a Hebrew newspaper title, producing HEBTEASESUM, the first dedicated multi-document summarization dataset in Hebrew.

TL;DR: This study used electronic health record data to track progression from acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD), revealing post-AKI clinical states and risk factors for CKD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying which AKI patients are at greatest risk of progressing to CKD has been difficult, and this paper aims to address this gap using a data-driven methodology.

Method: The authors used electronic health records and applied clustering, multi-state modeling, and survival analysis to categorize post-AKI states and evaluate CKD risk factors.

Result: Out of 20,699 AKI patients, 17% developed CKD. Fifteen distinct post-AKI states were identified, along with new and established CKD risk factors that vary by clinical state.

Conclusion: This study offers a systematic approach to predict CKD progression in AKI patients, which could facilitate early detection and tailored interventions via decision-support tools.

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

TL;DR: This paper investigates political bias detection by comparing human annotations and various LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN, finding divergent perceptions between humans and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the differences between human judgment and machine models in political bias detection.

Method: A comparative framework analyzing human annotations, bias polarity, inter-model agreement, and fine-tuning RoBERTa on a manually annotated dataset.

Result: RoBERTa (fine-tuned) aligns closely with human labels in accuracy, while GPT demonstrates strong agreement in a zero-shot setting.

Conclusion: Human and model biases differ systematically, suggesting hybrid approaches to improve automated media bias detection.

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous scientific discovery by integrating VLMs into multi-agent systems for improved interpretability and dynamic error correction.

Method: Agents use VLMs to evaluate plots as checkpoints against domain-specific rubrics, enabling real-time correction during exploratory data analysis.

Result: VLM-augmented systems achieved high performance on a 10-task benchmark, outperforming code-only and code-and-text baselines, with pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8.

Conclusion: VLMs improve adaptability, reasoning quality, and interpretability in autonomous scientific discovery systems, reducing reliance on human intervention.

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

TL;DR: RareSeek R1, a domain-specialized AI system for diagnosing rare diseases, improves on conventional methods through narrative-first reasoning and integrated clinical corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare diseases pose diagnosis challenges due to long timelines, noisy data, and limited training resources for AI models like LLMs.

Method: The authors developed RareSeek R1 using a domain-specialized clinical corpus, validated reasoning datasets, and techniques like staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph-based retrieval.

Result: RareSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in diagnosing rare diseases across multicenter EHR narratives and benchmarks, robustly handling noise and overlapping phenotypes.

Conclusion: The work advances AI diagnostics for rare diseases, offering reliable, transparent decision support capable of assisting or matching expert clinicians in performance.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

*Yuhan Zhang,Erxiao Wang,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates comparative illusions in language processing, proposing a noisy-channel model to explain their occurrence and validating this approach with empirical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why people misinterpret comparative illusion sentences and to test whether Bayesian noisy-channel inference explains this phenomenon.

Method: The study uses statistical language models combined with human behavioral data to quantitatively predict the comprehender's interpretation of comparative illusion sentences.

Result: The model successfully explains the gradations in illusion strength and identifies effects of pronominal vs. full noun phrase subjects in comparative illusion sentences.

Conclusion: The findings validate the noisy-channel theory for sentence comprehension as a unified framework, accounting for various language processing phenomena including comparative illusions.

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Motivation: To tackle annotation bias in NLP datasets that distort model outputs and lead to social harms, especially in culturally diverse settings.

Method: The paper introduces a framework distinguishing types of annotation bias, reviews detection methods like inter-annotator agreement and multilingual model divergence, and proposes proactive/reactive strategies for mitigation.

Result: Key contributions include a typology of annotation bias, synthesis of detection metrics, ensemble-based bias mitigation adapted for multilingual settings, and ethical analysis methodologies.

Conclusion: The paper aims to establish equitable and culturally grounded annotation processes for training multilingual Large Language Models by providing insights on bias understanding and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to streamline contract management by automating problematic revision detection and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulties in automating contract review and negotiation, specifically with scarce labeled data and unstructured legacy documents.

Method: The proposed framework includes synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment within a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline.

Result: The system achieved over 80% accuracy in identifying and optimizing problematic contract revisions in collaboration with an industry partner.

Conclusion: This modular framework demonstrates efficacy in real-world, low-resource conditions and offers a practical solution for speeding up contract revision workflows.

Abstract: Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement. During this process, revisions to provisions are proposed and iteratively refined, some of which may be problematic or unacceptable. Automating this workflow is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and the abundance of unstructured legacy contracts. In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.

TL;DR: Heaps' law, describing the relationship between word types and tokens, has been traditionally modeled as a power-law. This paper argues that a quadratic function better fits the type-token data in log-log scale, as demonstrated by analysis of English textual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the subtle curvature of Heaps' law in log-log scale challenges the standard assumption of a power-law relation, refining models for linguistic data.

Method: The authors analyzed type-token relations of twenty English novels or writings using regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with linear and quadratic terms. They also applied a model based on random drawing in a bag with replacement to investigate pseudo-variance.

Result: The quadratic model consistently showed a linear coefficient slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. The curvature identified was tied to "pseudo-variance," which is negative, offering an estimation method for small token cases despite instability with large numbers of tokens.

Conclusion: The research introduces a quadratic model for type-token relations as a better fit than the conventional power-law of Heaps' law, contributing to linguistic data modeling refinement using pseudo-variance with small token counts.

Abstract: Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.

### [75] [SMRC: Aligning Large Language Models with Student Reasoning for Mathematical Error Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14684)
*Biaojie Zeng,Min Zhang,Juan Zhou,Fengrui Liu,Ruiyang Huang,Xin Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMRC, a system designed to enhance how large language models correct student reasoning in mathematical problems using a teacher-style approach. It optimizes corrections using Monte Carlo Tree Search and creates a novel benchmark dataset for high school math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models lack the ability to perform "teacher-style" corrections in educational scenarios, which systematically guide students' reasoning. This gap creates the need for a method that aligns LLM responses with student reasoning to improve mathematical problem solving.

Method: The SMRC method models student reasoning as a multi-step decision problem and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to find optimal correction paths. To enable fine-grained supervision, it combines breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs with a back-propagation mechanism to distribute reward signals for intermediate steps. They also developed a high school math benchmark, MSEB, and proposed a dual evaluation protocol focused on solution accuracy and correct-step retention.

Result: SMRC significantly outperformed existing methods when applied to datasets like ProcessBench, MR-GSM8K, and their newly developed MSEB benchmark. It showed superior effectiveness and educational applicability.

Conclusion: SMRC is a promising method for improving the correction process of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, providing systematic guidance and better educational outcomes compared to previous approaches. The approach also sets a new benchmark with a dual evaluation protocol for assessing mathematical reasoning corrections.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode scientific measurements, focusing on astrophysics, using sparse autoencoders to explore the role of prompting and language in encoding physical summary statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observed generalization and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, exploring their potential to encode physical information derived from scientific measurements that are typically represented textually.

Method: The authors use astrophysics as a test bed and employ sparse autoencoders to study interpretable features in textual prompts, examining the role of prompting and linguistic elements in encoding physical measurement data.

Result: The study investigates the effectiveness of LLMs in codifying scientific measurements into embeddings and the influence of different prompts and language structures on this capability.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for encoding physical information from scientific data, but further research is required to refine their effectiveness, especially in terms of prompt engineering and linguistic encoding.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated the ability to generalize well at many levels across domains, modalities, and even shown in-context learning capabilities. This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement? We investigate this using sparse autoencoders that extract interpretable features from the text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulties in processing historical and low-resource NLP texts due to limited annotations and mismatches between old texts and modern corpora.

Method: The authors used large language models (LLMs) to generate ground-truth annotations on subsets of historical French and Chinese texts, followed by fine-tuning spaCy with these annotations.

Result: The fine-tuned spaCy models achieved significant performance improvements on period-specific NLP tasks, such as POS tagging, lemmatization, and named entity recognition.

Conclusion: This research highlights the value of domain-specific models and demonstrates how synthetically generated annotations, even in limited amounts, can enhance NLP tools for historical and low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.

*Rishu Kumar Singh,Navneet Shreya,Sarmistha Das,Apoorva Singh,Sriparna Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VALOR, a system for analyzing multimodal and multi-turn customer complaints, combining text and visual evidence for detailed classification of issue aspects and severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for complaint analysis struggle with unimodal, brief content, limiting their ability to handle complex dialogues involving both text and images.

Method: VALOR employs multi-expert reasoning via large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought prompting and calculates semantic alignment scores to ensure coherence between textual and visual modalities.

Result: VALOR outperforms baseline models on a multimodal complaint dataset, particularly in scenarios requiring integration of distributed information across text and images.

Conclusion: VALOR advances multimodal complaint analysis, improves accountability and product design, and supports AI-driven tools for scalable customer service, aligning with UN SDG goals for industry and responsible consumption.

Abstract: Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

*Ali Salehi,Cassandra L. Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares tokenization strategies for Kurdish embeddings, highlighting measurement biases and concluding that morpheme-based tokenization is more effective than BPE under comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify effective tokenization methods for Kurdish, a morphologically rich yet low-resource language, and address biases in evaluating these tokenization methods.

Method: The study uses a BiLSTM-CRF model for morphological segmentation with minimal manual annotation and evaluates Word2Vec embeddings using metrics like similarity preservation and semantic organization.

Result: Morpheme-based tokenization outperforms BPE in embedding organization and semantic structuring when accounting for evaluation biases in morphological complexity and test case coverage.

Conclusion: Morpheme-based tokenization ensures better performance for Kurdish embeddings, suggesting that evaluation frameworks must consider test case coverage and bias to support low-resource language processing.

Abstract: We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.

*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces nuCarla, a large-scale dataset designed to improve closed-loop simulation for autonomous driving by providing a simulation-compatible BEV dataset and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-loop simulation for end-to-end autonomous driving lacks standardized, large-scale datasets compatible for meaningful intermediate representation learning, hindering progress compared to simple rule-based baselines.

Method: nuCarla is developed within the CARLA simulator, offers compatibility with the nuScenes format, significant dataset scale, balanced distributions, and high-performance BEV models for detection.

Result: nuCarla delivers a robust dataset and high-quality BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results, enabling optimized performance in closed-loop simulations.

Conclusion: nuCarla addresses the gap in closed-loop simulation datasets and models, boosting E2E autonomous driving research toward reliability and safety.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to address overconfidence in Open Set Recognition (OSR) by mitigating inter-class overlap using uncertainty estimation and a two-stage unknown detection module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in OSR caused by overconfidence when unknown samples resemble known classes, leading to poor classification and blurred decision boundaries.

Method: The proposed framework uses a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module for generating diverse predictions and a two-stage classifier for enhanced discrimination between known and unknown classes.

Result: Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate superior OSR performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces overconfidence and improves the OSR system's ability to distinguish between known and unknown classes.

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) by using a novel object-aware temporal modeling technique, leading to significant performance gains across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, maintaining temporal consistency, and avoiding reliance on complex region proposals, which are computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a filtering mechanism to propagate high-confidence object features across frames efficiently and employs few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, avoiding explicit object tube proposals.

Result: The method achieves notable AP improvements: 3.7% on FSVOD-500, 5.3% on FSYTV-40, 4.3% on VidOR, and 4.5% on VidVRD in the 5-shot setting, with further gains in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot settings.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates enhanced detection accuracy and robust temporal consistency in the few-shot setting, effectively addressing the challenges of FSVOD and offering a practical, efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

TL;DR: This study introduces a probabilistic transport approach to multi-modal image fusion, enhancing sampling efficiency, structural consistency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-modal image fusion, particularly the high training costs, task-specific limitations, and slow inference of generative models.

Method: The approach adopts flow matching for efficient sampling, uses pseudo-labels selected via a task-aware function, and includes a Fusion Refiner module for pseudo-label enhancement. Multi-task learning is augmented with elastic weight consolidation and experience replay.

Result: The proposed method delivers competitive performance across various fusion tasks while maintaining efficiency, scalability, and a lightweight design.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified, scalable model for image fusion with improved efficiency and multi-task learning capabilities, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a trajectory-free crash detection framework using a novel diffusion-based road segment map generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-time crash detection accuracy and address trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking limitations.

Method: A two-stage framework using Mapfusion for road segment map generation and comparison of monitored data with generated maps for crash detection.

Result: Mapfusion generates realistic road segment evolution maps and accurately detects crashes, demonstrated through experiments on real-world crashes.

Conclusion: The framework successfully detects crashes with improved accuracy and robustness, enhancing traffic safety and efficiency.

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-grid adaptive training strategy using Hilbert encoding tailored for seismic data to improve model pretraining by effectively capturing high- and low-frequency features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismic data differ from other data types because of unique high- and low-frequency features that are critical yet inefficiently processed by existing models, such as sequentially tokenized vision transformers.

Method: The authors propose the ADATG approach, which uses spectrum decomposition to separate frequency components and hierarchical Hilbert encoding, coupled with an adaptive coarse-to-fine training strategy to enhance seismic data modeling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that this training method effectively captures seismic data characteristics, improving the performance of seismic visual foundation models.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency-aware encoding and adaptive training strategies tailored to seismic data can significantly benefit seismic foundation model pretraining, offering advancements in understanding complex seismic patterns.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a non-invasive and language-independent approach for early dementia screening using facial micro dynamics analysis from short, unscripted videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of current dementia screening methods relying on speech or scripted interviews, which are bound to language, transcription, and clinical settings.

Method: The authors analyze temporal facial kinematics such as blink dynamics and subtle head motions, converting them into interpretable time series and clip-level statistics for prediction.

Result: Testing on YT DemTalk dataset revealed significant performance, achieving AUROC 0.953, AP 0.961, F1-score 0.851, and accuracy 0.857, highlighting gaze and mouth dynamics as key indicators.

Conclusion: Facial micro dynamic analysis shows potential for scalable, language-independent dementia screening, enabling natural video analysis across diverse contexts.

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning is explored as a way for video generation models to simulate real-world dynamics. The paper introduces the Gen-ViRe benchmark to evaluate and improve cognitive abilities in video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Chain-of-Thought prompting struggles to adapt to continuous, physics-based scenarios in real-world settings. Benchmarks for video reasoning are lacking, hindering systematic improvement of video models.

Method: The paper introduces Gen-ViRe, a benchmark framework that evaluates six cognitive dimensions across 24 subtasks. It uses multi-source data, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid evaluation via Vision-Language Models.

Result: Experiments reveal disparity between visual quality and actual reasoning capabilities in state-of-the-art video generation models. Baselines and diagnostic tools are provided for improvement.

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe fills the gap in assessing video models' reasoning capabilities and offers guidance for developing models that simulate real-world dynamics effectively.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

TL;DR: This paper addresses three issues with heatmap-based human pose estimation methods by proposing ranking-based losses. Their approach significantly improves the localization and evaluation accuracy in pose estimation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the limitations of traditional heatmap-based pose estimation methods, including inefficient loss functions (MSE), spatial and class-wise imbalance of heatmaps, and the evaluation metric misalignment with the loss functions.

Method: The authors proposed ranking-based losses that focus on confidence scores and localization qualities, aligning losses with the evaluation metric (mAP) for better performance and more accurate predictions.

Result: RSPose, the newly trained model using their method, achieved state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, RSPose achieved 79.9 mAP on the COCO-val dataset using ViTPose-H and an improvement of 1.5 AP for SimCC Resnet-50.

Conclusion: Ranking-based losses effectively address the major issues in heatmap-based human pose estimation, leading to improved average precision and better alignment with evaluation metrics.

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CS3 task, where the goal is to segment visual objects that cause collision sounds in videos, using audio cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by humans' ability to understand object properties through sound, specifically in recognizing objects from collision interactions.

Method: The authors propose a weakly-supervised audio-conditioned segmentation method utilizing foundation models (CLIP and SAM2), and egocentric cues like objects in hands.

Result: Their method significantly outperforms baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on two newly introduced benchmarks: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Conclusion: The work provides a novel and effective approach to audio-conditioned segmentation in cluttered egocentric videos, setting a strong baseline for the new CS3 task.

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [91] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometric Representation Regression (GRR), reformulating pose estimation to predict disentangled geometric components, yielding improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current Absolute Pose Regression (APR) approaches, which often memorize training views instead of understanding 3D scene geometry.

Method: Developed Geometric Representation Regression, predicting geometric components (ray directions and pointmap) and recovering the camera pose using a differentiable deterministic solver.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets.

Conclusion: Modeling the inverse rendering process improves robustness and generalization in absolute pose estimation, separating visual-to-geometry mapping from final pose computation.

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new multi-sequence MRI dataset for bladder cancer recurrence prediction and proposes a novel AI model, H-CNN-ViT, which achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the high recurrence rate of bladder cancer and the diagnostic challenges posed by post-surgical changes, there is a need for effective diagnostic tools and dedicated datasets to improve prediction accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce both a curated MRI dataset and H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical attention-based model combining CNNs and ViTs for optimal feature fusion while considering different imaging modalities independently.

Result: H-CNN-ViT outperforms current state-of-the-art models with an AUC of 78.6%, as evaluated on the newly introduced MRI dataset.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable dataset and a novel, high-performing model for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, facilitating further progress in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces QwenCLIP, a framework that enhances medical image-text alignment and performance by replacing CLIP's text encoder with a large language model-based embedding module and utilizing learnable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing vision-language models like CLIP and its domain-specific adaptations, including restricted input length and shallow semantic understanding, especially in representing long and complex radiology reports.

Method: The paper proposes QwenCLIP, which integrates a large language model-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) instead of CLIP's text encoder and incorporates learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Result: QwenCLIP captures rich medical semantics from long-form clinical text and demonstrates significant improvement in medical image-text alignment and performance on radiology benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, QwenCLIP, effectively overcomes limitations of input length and semantic depth, showcasing its potential for improving vision-language tasks in the medical domain.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid model architecture combining EfficientNet and VGG19, with specialized layers to improve the accuracy of lumbar spine degeneration classification in DICOM images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in traditional transfer learning for medical image analysis, which often fails to capture detailed anatomical features and struggles with high-dimensional data.

Method: A novel framework integrates EfficientNet and VGG19, incorporating Pseudo-Newton Boosting and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction layers. These layers focus on enhancing feature weighting and reducing redundancy.

Result: The proposed model achieved significant performance improvements, including 88.1% accuracy, 0.9 precision, 0.861 recall, 0.88 F1 score, and a loss of 0.18 compared to a baseline model.

Conclusion: This enhanced architecture successfully addresses traditional limitations in transfer learning for medical images while significantly improving diagnostic capabilities of automated tools.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of VLMs in autonomous driving, such as inconsistent performance and reliance on handcrafted prompts, and to improve robustness and generalization in real-world applications.

Method: The proposed method shifts VLMs from decision generators to semantic enhancers, enriching visual data with structured scene descriptions. A multi-modal architecture and a post-hoc refinement module are introduced to improve decision accuracy and interpretability.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two autonomous driving benchmarks, demonstrating improved decision-making and reliable predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs as semantic enhancers in autonomous driving systems leads to better performance and more interpretable outcomes, showcasing a viable path for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how data scaling laws affect medical anatomical segmentation, a relatively unexplored domain, and to improve model performance with reduced costs by leveraging deformation-guided data augmentations.

Method: The paper analyzes scaling laws across diverse segmentation tasks and imaging modalities, introduces deformation-guided and novel diffeomorphic-based augmentation strategies, and evaluates their impact experimentally.

Result: The experimental results show that deformation-based augmentations enhance data utilization efficiency, improve segmentation performance, and surpass standard scaling trends without requiring more data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of scaling and deformation strategies in medical imaging segmentation, enabling efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Hema is proposed as a unified multi-modal model for digital hematopathology tasks, leveraging diverse datasets with multimodal capabilities to surpass single-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing models in digital hematopathology which cannot provide unified, multi-task reasoning across diverse diseases and tasks.

Method: Uni-Hema integrates detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning using Hema-Former—a multimodal module bridging visual and textual hierarchies across multiple datasets.

Result: Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to single-task models while enabling interpretable single-cell insights across various hematological tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-Hema sets a new benchmark for digital hematopathology by unifying multi-task and multi-modal approaches and promising to release its code for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,John A. Lory,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a weakly supervised pipeline for detecting ephemeral gullies using remote sensing and Vision Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ephemeral gullies cause significant soil erosion in agricultural fields, yet their short temporal cycles and limited labeled data make detection challenging with traditional methods and machine learning.

Method: A weakly supervised pipeline leveraging VLMs and a teacher-student model. The teacher learns from noisy labels provided by VLMs while the student is trained with weak supervision and a noise-aware loss function.

Result: The proposed method outperforms VLM-only and label model approaches, demonstrating effective detection of ephemeral gullies. A unique dataset including 18,000 high-resolution images spanning 13 years was released.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust machine learning approach to detect ephemeral gullies utilizing weak supervision, addressing challenges of scarce labeled data and manual labeling effort.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

*Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Idil Bilge Altun,Zhihe Lu,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using compressed video motion vectors (MVs) to assess temporal behavior and improve evaluations and discriminative tasks in generative video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics prioritize spatial appearance, neglecting temporal realism, which is critical for generative video models.

Method: The study uses codec-generated motion vectors (MVs) to evaluate motion realism through divergence calculations and investigates fusion methods enhancing models' temporal reasoning with MVs.

Result: Temporal defects in state-of-the-art generative videos were systematically identified, demonstrating improved classification accuracy (up to I3D achieving 99.0%) by incorporating MV signals.

Conclusion: Compressed-domain MVs are effective for diagnosing temporal flaws in generative videos and for bolstering temporal reasoning in discriminative tasks.

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAE-MCVT, a real-time scalable framework for Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT) in city-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the importance of vehicle tracking for applications like anomaly detection and traffic analysis, existing solutions prioritize accuracy without addressing the challenges of scaling and real-time performance, especially with city-level setups involving numerous cameras.

Method: The proposed SAE-MCVT framework uses edge devices to process RTSP video streams for object detection, tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Metadata is transmitted to a central workstation which performs cross-camera vehicle association via spatial-temporal relationships learned by a self-supervised camera link model.

Result: Experiments using the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2 while maintaining real-time performance with 2K 15 FPS video streams.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework designed to handle city-scale deployments, balancing performance and scalability effectively.

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

Motivation: To investigate how effectively AI systems, specifically multi-modal LLMs, understand and interpret road safety norms, critical for guiding autonomous vehicles.

Method: A pilot dataset of images sourced from school textbooks depicting traffic signs and road safety norms was curated. Evaluations were conducted in a zero-shot setting using LLMs to assess their reasoning capabilities.

Result: The preliminary results showed that multi-modal LLMs struggle with understanding safety reasoning concepts, highlighting significant performance gaps compared to human interpretation.

Conclusion: The study identifies clear gaps between human learning and model interpretation of road safety norms, emphasizing the need for further research to improve AI systems' understanding in this domain.

Abstract: Following road safety norms is non-negotiable not only for humans but also for the AI systems that govern autonomous vehicles. In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks when outputs are lengthy or complex. The proposed Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO) improves training by structuring data progressively, leading to consistent performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address deficiencies in CoT reasoning for Visual Grounding tasks, especially when faced with lengthy or complex outputs, and to explore optimal training strategies for improved performance.

Method: CuRPO is proposed as a training strategy that uses CoT length and gIoU rewards to gradually structure training data, moving from simpler examples to more complex ones.

Result: Experiments show CuRPO outperforms existing methods like Visual-RFT, achieving up to +12.52 mAP on datasets such as RefCOCO. It also performs well in few-shot learning scenarios and tasks with ambiguous textual descriptions.

Conclusion: CuRPO proves to be effective, efficient, and robust, improving Visual Grounding performance and handling complexities in training data.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

### [104] [Can You Learn to See Without Images? Procedural Warm-Up for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13945)
*Zachary Shinnick,Liangze Jiang,Hemanth Saratchandran,Damien Teney,Anton van den Hengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel vision transformer (ViT) pretraining strategy using procedurally-generated data with no visual or semantic content, achieving significant improvements in training efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore new ways to instill universal inductive biases into vision transformers to improve their data efficiency and performance across different domains, leveraging generic abstract priors.

Method: The authors pretrain vision transformers using procedurally-generated data created with algorithms like formal grammars, bypassing visual patch embeddings to instill abstract computational biases. This is followed by conventional image-based training.

Result: Using 1% of the training budget on procedural pretraining improves ImageNet-1k accuracy by over 1.7%, equating to the effect of using 28% of the ImageNet-1k data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of procedural pretraining in making vision transformer training more data-efficient and domain-agnostic, offering a novel direction for future pretraining strategies.

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

*Kevin I. Ruiz Vargas,Gabriel G. Galdino,Tsang Ing Ren,Alexandre L. Cunha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for cell image segmentation using a scalar field learned via a trained network, paired with the watershed method for segmentation. Solutions are based on PDEs and provide efficient and robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve cell instance segmentation by learning scalar fields, ensuring robustness, computational efficiency, and sharp boundary delineation while mitigating impacts of data outliers.

Method: The approach involves learning scalar fields obtained as solutions to the Poisson and heat equations through a neural network and applying the watershed method for segmentation. No regularization is applied, focusing solely on field residual minimization.

Result: Competitive results are shown against public datasets, demonstrating sharp cell boundaries and robustness in segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method is computationally efficient, reduces memory and energy demand, while achieving effective and geometrically insightful cell segmentation.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

*Kumar Ashutosh,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CrossTrainer, a transferable video representation model for skill assessment across sports, which identifies common skill-attributes and delivers actionable feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack generalizability across sports and rely on high-cost expert supervision, prompting the need for a transferable system for skill assessment.

Method: CrossTrainer employs transferable video representations, discovers skill-attributes transcending sport-specific boundaries, and trains a multimodal language model for feedback generation and proficiency assessment.

Result: CrossTrainer demonstrated improved performance with gains up to 60% over state-of-the-art methods in cross-sport and intra-sport settings on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances generalization across sports and enriches multimodal language models by leveraging shared human skill behaviors.

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

*Xianming Gu,Lihui Wang,Ying Cao,Zeyu Deng,Yingfeng Ou,Guodong Hu,Yi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-prompt expert network (CD-DPE) using convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-FDM and DP-FFEM) to improve multi-contrast MRI super-resolution, achieving superior performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance multi-contrast MRI resolution to improve anatomical detail and diagnostic potential, overcoming challenges due to contrast disparities across modalities.

Method: New CD-DPE network, featuring a CD-FDM for decoupling features and a DP-FFEM for optimal feature integration using frequency and adaptive routing prompts.

Result: CD-DPE achieves better reconstruction than existing methods, with strong generalization on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: CD-DPE offers a robust approach for improving MRI detail resolution, addressing feature integration challenges effectively while ensuring wide applicability.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

*Kaichen Zhou,Laura Dodds,Sayed Saad Afzal,Fadel Adib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE is a system and benchmark for indoor scene understanding using single-static radar, addressing layout reconstruction and object detection challenges, leveraging radar's penetration and privacy benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges with existing optical sensors in indoor environments, which face occlusion and privacy risks, and to exploit the penetration and privacy-preserving benefits of mmWave radar despite its low resolution.

Method: RISE introduces Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement to leverage multipath reflections and a Hierarchical Diffusion framework to process radar responses for layout and object detection tasks.

Result: RISE achieves a 60% improvement in layout reconstruction accuracy compared to prior methods and delivers the first object detection capabilities using mmWave radar with a 58% IoU.

Conclusion: RISE establishes a new groundwork for indoor scene understanding that is both privacy-preserving and geometry-aware, using single-static radar data and effectively enhancing radar's spatial reasoning.

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

*SangHyuk Kim,Daniel Haehn,Sumientra Rampersad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a classifier for accurately determining plane orientation metadata in MRI slices using a 2.5D context-aware model, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenges of missing plane orientation metadata in MRI images, which complicates analysis, leads to domain shifts in heterogeneous dataset integration, and lowers diagnostic classifier accuracy.

Method: The authors use a 2.5D context-aware model to enhance slice orientation recognition by leveraging multi-slice information. They train the model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images, comparing its accuracy against a baseline 2D reference model.

Result: The 2.5D model achieved an accuracy of 99.49%, reducing classification errors by 60% compared to the 2D reference model's 98.74% accuracy. The study also shows a brain tumor detection model's accuracy improving from 97.0% to 98.0% when using metadata-enhanced predictions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of 2.5D context in improving MRI image processing and diagnostic performance. The developed model, validated through practical applications like tumor detection, is made accessible as an open-source tool.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

*Md Shazid Islam,Shreyangshu Bera,Sudipta Paul,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LINGUAL, a framework leveraging natural language instructions for active learning in medical image segmentation, improving efficiency and reducing annotation time by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning for medical image segmentation is challenging due to the labor-intensive and cognitively demanding nature of precise boundary annotation. This is especially difficult with ambiguous boundaries in medical images, necessitating novel alternatives.

Method: LINGUAL uses natural language guidance from experts, which is translated into executable programs through in-context learning. The framework automates segmentation tasks based on these instructions, minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Result: LINGUAL achieves comparable or better segmentation performance compared to traditional active learning baselines, while significantly reducing annotation time by approximately 80%.

Conclusion: LINGUAL demonstrates the potential of language guidance to alleviate the cognitive and labor-intensive challenges of medical image segmentation. It reduces annotation efforts and offers a novel, efficient approach to active learning in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

*Sungik Choi,Hankook Lee,Moontae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection method, leveraging self-supervised models and their properties, to effectively detect AI-generated images across diverse datasets and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of vision-generative models makes detecting AI-generated images essential, while traditional detectors require extensive dataset-specific training.

Method: WaRPAD exploits self-supervised models trained with augmentation techniques like RandomResizedCrop. It uses Haar wavelet decomposition to assess embedding sensitivity and calculates a detection score based on cropped and resized image patches.

Result: WaRPAD demonstrates competitive detection performance across images from 23 generative models, real datasets of different resolutions and domains, and maintains robustness against test-time corruptions.

Conclusion: WaRPAD is a robust, training-free AI-generated image detection method applicable across self-supervised models, offering consistent detection performance without dataset-specific training.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

TL;DR: FashionMAC proposes a method for garment-centric fashion image generation using a diffusion-based framework that avoids garment deformation, ensuring higher fidelity and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve garment-centric fashion image generation by addressing challenges in preserving garment details and enhancing fine-grained controllability over human model appearance.

Method: The method utilizes a deformation-free framework using diffusion-based outpainting of segmented garments. It includes a region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism and chained mask injection to achieve intricate control.

Result: Experiments show FashionMAC outperforms existing methods in preserving garment details and achieving fine-grained attribute control.

Conclusion: FashionMAC provides a novel solution with improved realism and precision in fashion image synthesis by eliminating garment deformation and introducing advanced controllability mechanisms.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flood prediction often requires accurate maps for emergency planning, but current methods are computationally intense and unsuitable for real-time applications.

Method: The authors use latent diffusion models to achieve super-resolution on flood maps, incorporating physics-informed inputs to enhance interpretability and generalizability.

Result: Latent diffusion models reduce inference time while retaining accuracy, outperforming traditional methods and exhibiting better adaptability to new geographic regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient and precise flood risk assessment, making it suitable for real-time applications while providing interpretable and transferable predictions.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve End-to-End (E2E) Autonomous Driving (AD) systems by providing risk-focused attention, resulting in enhanced handling of complex driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the generalization issues in current Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, particularly their inability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations, and to find a computationally efficient alternative to hybrid or end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks.

Method: This research introduces a novel Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) framework that incorporates a plug-in module called RiskHead. RiskHead extracts causal risk information from Vision-Language Models and integrates it into Bird's-Eye-View features, creating interpretable risk-attention maps.

Result: Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in improving the AD system's performance in perception and planning, particularly in complex and dynamic driving conditions.

Conclusion: By focusing on risk attention and enhancing key object identification, the proposed RSD framework successfully improves the model's generalization and alignment with human-like driving behavior in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and efficiency in detecting and classifying defects in concrete bridge structures through the use of drone imagery and advanced computer vision techniques.

Method: The framework consists of two stages: (1) saliency for generating defect region proposals based on local discontinuities, and (2) a YOLOX-based deep learning detector enhanced using saliency-driven brightness augmentation applying to defect bounding boxes.

Result: The method shows high accuracy and computational efficiency when validated on standard datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for the task.

Conclusion: The system has significant potential for autonomous deployment in self-powered inspection systems due to its strong performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a novel approach enhancing autoregressive models for general image editing through semantic-context-driven mechanisms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models, while effective in image generation, struggle with general image editing due to poor conditioning and inefficiency.

Method: SCAR introduces Compressed Semantic Prefilling for compact encoding of high-level semantics and Semantic Alignment Guidance for aligning hidden states with target semantics during decoding.

Result: SCAR outperforms prior autoregressive methods in visual fidelity, semantic alignment, and controllability on editing and generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCAR demonstrates the feasibility of highly controllable and semantically aligned autoregressive models for image editing, with minimal architectural adjustments to existing paradigms.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-Guided Token Merging (Co-Me), an acceleration mechanism for visual geometric transformers without retraining or finetuning the base model. Co-Me distilled a light-weight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence ones, effectively reducing computation while maintaining spatial coverage. Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\times$ and $7.2\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction.

*Jingyu Lei,Gaoang Wang,Der-Horng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE (Compact Object-centric Representations) introduces a new visual token compression method for LVLMs aiming to efficiently process images while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of computational costs in LVLMs caused by quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution and the lack of semantic understanding in existing token compression methods.

Method: CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks for semantic guidance in token merging and employs a centroid-guided sorting mechanism to retain spatial order.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results in fixed-rate compression benchmarks, dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings, and 97.4% baseline performance with extreme compression retaining only 2.2% of visual tokens.

Conclusion: Object-centric representations effectively improve efficiency and performance in LVLM processing, demonstrating their potential for advanced vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

### [120] [Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis for Few-Shot Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14082)
*Yao Qin,Yangyang Yan,YuanChao Yang,Jinhua Pang,Huanyong Bi,Yuan Liu,HaiHua Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, SGPS, which eliminates the need for training by directly synthesizing task-specific classifier parameters using a pre-trained generative engine based on minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis faces bottlenecks due to dependence on large annotated datasets, particularly challenging for rare diseases with limited data.

Method: Proposes SGPS, a Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer, which generates classifier parameters by using minimal input—a single image and clinical description—via a generative engine.

Result: SGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance in 1-shot and 5-shot classifications, surpassing current few-shot and zero-shot methods, as demonstrated on ISIC 2018 and a rare disease dataset.

Conclusion: The method allows rapid AI tool development for medical diagnostics, especially for rare diseases, by eliminating the conventional need for extensive data and training.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

### [121] [Automated glenoid bone loss measurement and segmentation in CT scans for pre-operative planning in shoulder instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14083)
*Zhonghao Liu,Hanxue Gu,Qihang Li,Michael Fox,Jay M. Levin,Maciej A. Mazurowski,Brian C. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on CT scans, demonstrating time efficiency and reliability exceeding manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in measuring glenoid bone loss, which is crucial for preoperative planning in shoulder instability. Current manual and semi-automated methods are time-intensive and prone to interreader variability.

Method: The paper outlines a three-stage deep learning approach: 1) U-Net for automatic segmentation of the glenoid and humerus, 2) detection of anatomical landmarks using a second network, and 3) application of PCA, projection, and circle fitting to calculate bone loss.

Result: The automated method shows strong agreement with consensus readings (ICC 0.84) and performs better than manual surgeon assessments, especially in subgroups of low and high bone loss. It also effectively classifies patients into low/medium/high bone-loss categories without misclassification between extremes.

Conclusion: The developed pipeline is a reliable and time-efficient tool for assessing glenoid bone loss, enhancing preoperative preparation and patient screening for significant bone loss.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

### [122] [Error-Driven Scene Editing for 3D Grounding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14086)
*Yue Zhang,Zun Wang,Han Lin,Jialu Li,Jianing Yang,Yonatan Bitton,Idan Szpektor,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEER-3D, a framework that addresses biases and limitations in 3D large language models (3D-LLMs) by using targeted 3D scene edits to enhance spatial and visual grounding accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-LLMs struggle to accurately ground language to spatial and visual elements due to limited 3D resources and inherent biases from training data focused on language reasoning.

Method: The proposed method involves a structured framework—DEER-3D—that detects grounding errors and addresses them through targeted 3D scene edits aligned with specific predicates, followed by iterative re-training with counterfactual data.

Result: DEER-3D improves grounding accuracy across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks through iterative and targeted refinement.

Conclusion: Targeted, error-driven 3D scene edits effectively enhance the fusion of linguistic reasoning with spatial grounding in 3D-LLMs, highlighting a practical solution to address inherent biases in such models.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

*Jun Ding,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medical image segmentation is enhanced using GCA-ResUNet, combining grouped coordinate modeling in ResNet-50 blocks for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate global context modeling into convolutional architectures, addressing the limitations of U-Net and computational demands of transformer-based models, for better medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposed GCA-ResUNet, embedding Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks, to encode global dependencies with minimal computational overhead and improved feature and boundary representation.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 86.11% on the Synapse dataset and 92.64% on the ACDC dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks with less computational cost.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet effectively combines global modeling with convolutional efficiency, enabling high-accuracy and computationally efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

### [124] [SMGeo: Cross-View Object Geo-Localization with Grid-Level Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14093)
*Fan Zhang,Haoyuan Ren,Fei Ma,Qiang Yin,Yongsheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMGeo, an end-to-end transformer-based model designed for precise drone-to-satellite object geo-localization, utilizing innovative approaches like sparse Mixture-of-Experts to handle complex differences in image viewpoints and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for cross-view object geo-localization struggle with viewpoint differences, scale disparities, and background noise, often leading to errors in multi-stage pipelines.

Method: SMGeo adopts a fully transformer-based architecture, using Swin-Transformers for feature encoding and a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts for dependency adaptation. It also uses anchor-free detection heads for direct object localization via heat-map supervision.

Result: The proposed SMGeo model demonstrates significantly better performance compared to other methods, achieving high accuracy (e.g., 87.51% at IoU=0.25) and outperforming the benchmark DetGeo in multiple metrics.

Conclusion: SMGeo sets a new standard for interactive and accurate object geo-localization with its end-to-end design, achieving notable improvements through innovative features like query-guided fusion and Mixture-of-Experts.

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

### [125] [BCE3S: Binary Cross-Entropy Based Tripartite Synergistic Learning for Long-tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14097)
*Weijia Fan,Qiufu Li,Jiajun Wen,Xiaoyang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses long-tailed recognition (LTR) issues using a novel BCE-based tripartite learning (BCE3S) approach to improve class feature compactness, separability, and classifier balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using cross-entropy loss fail to adequately address issues in feature compactness, inter-class separability, and classifier vector balance in LTR tasks due to the coupling of imbalanced classifier vectors in the loss function.

Method: The authors propose BCE3S, a binary cross-entropy-based approach combining joint learning (for feature compactness and separability), contrastive learning (for intra-class compactness), and uniform learning (to balance classifier separability).

Result: Experimental results show that BCE3S achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-tailed datasets (e.g., CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018) by improving feature properties and balancing classifier behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed BCE3S framework effectively addresses LTR challenges and sets a new performance benchmark with better feature and classifier characteristics in imbalanced data scenarios.

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAPE-IR is a unified framework for All-in-One Image Restoration that uses a Multimodal Large Language Model for planning and a diffusion-based executor with frequency-aware components, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current image restoration methods that rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, which struggle with diverse, real-world degradations.

Method: FAPE-IR combines a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model as a restoration planner with a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts module in a diffusion executor, integrating frequency-awareness and adversarial training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and shows excellent zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

Conclusion: FAPE-IR presents a flexible, interpretable, and unified solution for image restoration by coupling semantic planning with frequency-based enhancement strategies.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-driven video editing often requires explicit editing instructions, but this paper introduces RIVER, a novel model for reasoning-based implicit video editing using multi-hop reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing models require specific spatial and temporal editing details, which limits users when edits stem from implicit queries referencing complex semantic or relational properties.

Method: RIVER decouples reasoning from generation using digital twins of video content and employs a large language model alongside reinforcement learning to execute reasoning-based implicit edits.

Result: RIVER achieves strong performance on RVEBenchmark, a new dataset with complex implicit queries, and surpasses baselines on other editing benchmarks like VegGIE and FiVE.

Conclusion: RIVER proposes an innovative approach to video editing via implicit reasoning, utilizing structured reasoning and digital twin representations for better precision and flexibility in edits.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation models either demand high computational resources or compromise performance when optimized for efficiency, limiting their real-world applications.

Method: The method proposed, RTS-Mono, uses a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder, Lite-Encoder, and a multi-scale sparse fusion framework in the decoder work to reduce redundancy, ensure depth estimation performance, and boost computational efficiency.

Result: RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art results in both high and low resolutions on the KITTI dataset with extremely low model parameters (3 M). It significantly improves accuracy metrics such as Abs Rel and Sq Rel, and operates at 49 FPS on Nvidia Jetson Orin with high accuracy.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono is a practical, real-time monocular depth estimation model with high accuracy, computational efficiency, and readiness for real-world deployment, including autonomous driving and robotics scenarios.

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

*Zhenyu Li,Tianyi Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an asymmetric aggregation approach for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), called $A^2$GC-VPR, that improves matching accuracy using geometric constraints and distributional adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VPR methods face limitations in feature aggregation due to symmetric approaches like Sinkhorn algorithm, which do not adequately handle differing distributions of image features and cluster centers.

Method: The proposed method ($A^2$GC-VPR) leverages asymmetric aggregation with row-column normalization and distinct marginal calibration. It incorporates learnable coordinate embeddings for geometric constraints to improve feature clustering with spatial awareness.

Result: Experimental evaluations on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets confirm that $A^2$GC-VPR outperforms existing methods in matching accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: $A^2$GC-VPR enhances Visual Place Recognition with a novel asymmetric approach, addressing distributional discrepancies and incorporating spatial awareness, proving effective across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational, memory, and energy demands of existing Vision Transformers, which limit their deployment on low-resource platforms.

Method: Introduced the Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN) within a novel lightweight ViT model named CViT. CCFFN splits input features to improve parameter and computational efficiency.

Result: CViT-XL achieves 75.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with 15% lower FLOPs and 3.3% lower energy consumption compared to EfficientViT-M5. The CViT family shows superior energy efficiency across model sizes.

Conclusion: CViT architectures are highly efficient, consuming the least energy among comparable models, and serve as strong candidates for deployment on devices with constrained energy, like mobile phones and drones.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.

*Ziyao Zeng,Jingcheng Ni,Ruyi Liu,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Coffee, a method for preventing text-to-image diffusion models from learning undesired concepts during fine-tuning through language-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for controllable fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models is motivated by challenges like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, and attribute disentanglement, as well as ensuring generalizable fine-tuning.

Method: Coffee uses language descriptions to specify undesired concepts and regularizes the fine-tuning process by preventing user-prompt embeddings from aligning with these undesired concepts, without requiring additional training.

Result: Experiments reveal that Coffee prevents the learning of undesired concepts effectively and performs better than existing methods in fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: Coffee offers a practical and efficient method for controlling fine-tuning in diffusion models, making it a useful tool for various downstream applications. Code will be released later.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

*Hao Zhen,Yunxiang Yang,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MP-PVIR framework, which utilizes advanced vision-language models to analyze pedestrian-vehicle incidents through structured multi-view video reasoning and prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address urban pedestrian-vehicle safety challenges by providing actionable insights into cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior during incidents, rather than just detecting incidents.

Method: The MP-PVIR framework includes multi-view video acquisition, behavioral phase segmentation using TG-VLM, phase-specific reasoning with PhaVR-VLM, and report synthesis via a large language model.

Result: With metrics such as mIoU = 0.4881 for segmentation and phase-aware captioning accuracy of 33.063, MP-PVIR demonstrates effective multi-view video diagnostics on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR enhances understanding of pedestrian incidents, offering structured insights for proactive safety measures, thereby advancing AI applications for traffic safety analytics.

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

### [133] [Attention Via Convolutional Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14137)
*Mingi Kang,Jeová Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified framework, ConvNN, connecting convolution and attention under a k-nearest neighbor aggregation approach, and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify convolution and attention mechanisms in vision models and explore their intermediate spectrum for better performance and interpretability.

Method: Introduced ConvNN framework that generalizes both convolution and attention through a k-nearest neighbor aggregation approach, enabling systematic exploration of operations between the two.

Result: ConvNN improves accuracy in both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets when applied to hybrid architectures like VGG and ViT, showcasing regularization benefits.

Conclusion: ConvNN bridges the gap between convolution and attention, offering new insights and regularization advantages for designing vision architectures.

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

### [134] [SMART: Shot-Aware Multimodal Video Moment Retrieval with Audio-Enhanced MLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14143)
*An Yu,Weiheng Lu,Jian Li,Zhenfei Zhang,Yunhang Shen,Felix X. -F. Ye,Ming-Ching Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMART, an MLLM-based framework that improves video moment retrieval by integrating audio cues and shot-level temporal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video moment retrieval rely on coarse temporal understanding and single visual modality, restricting their effectiveness for complex videos.

Method: SMART combines audio and visual features, uses Shot-aware Token Compression to reduce redundancy and retain detailed information, and refines prompts for better audio-visual usage.

Result: SMART significantly improves state-of-the-art methods, achieving marked performance gains on Charades-STA and QVHighlights datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating audio cues and leveraging shot-level structures enhance video moment retrieval, offering superior performance in complex video scenarios.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

### [135] [iGaussian: Real-Time Camera Pose Estimation via Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14149)
*Hao Wang,Linqing Zhao,Xiuwei Xu,Jiwen Lu,Haibin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces iGaussian, a feed-forward framework for real-time camera pose estimation using 3D Gaussian inversion, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the inefficiency and computational overhead of iterative approaches in real-time camera pose estimation for robotics using 3D Gaussians.

Method: iGaussian uses a two-stage process: (1) a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial sampling and attention mechanisms for coarse pose estimation, and (2) feature matching with multi-model fusion for refinement, without relying on differentiable rendering.

Result: iGaussian reduces median rotation errors to 0.2° and achieves a significant speedup (2.87 FPS) compared to optimization-based methods. Experimental validation on NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets supports its effectiveness.

Conclusion: iGaussian's novel approach, including its cross-correlation module and weighted multi-view predictor, delivers substantial improvements in real-time camera pose estimation, making it more suitable for robotics applications.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

*Laura Dodds,Maisy Lam,Waleed Akbar,Yibo Cheng,Fadel Adib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wave-Former is a novel method for high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction of occluded objects using mmWave wireless signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing 3D shapes of occluded objects struggle with limited coverage and high noise. Improved solutions can benefit robotics, augmented reality, and logistics.

Method: Wave-Former uses a three-stage pipeline: 1) candidate geometric surface proposal, 2) transformer-based shape completion model specific to mmWave properties, and 3) entropy-guided surface selection. Synthetic data is used for training.

Result: Wave-Former improves recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining 85% precision, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Wave-Former demonstrates strong potential for practical applications by effectively leveraging mmWave signals and physics-aware design for 3D shape reconstruction.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

### [137] [Learning Representation and Synergy Invariances: A Povable Framework for Generalized Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14157)
*Xun Lin,Shuai Wang,Yi Yu,Zitong Yu,Jiale Zhou,Yizhong Liu,Xiaochun Cao,Alex Kot,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing by proposing a framework called RiSe to improve cross-domain generalization through invariant representation and synergy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the performance degradation of multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods in unseen domains caused by overlooked modal representation and synergy risks.

Method: The RiSe framework includes Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM) to handle modal representation risks and Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD) for reducing spurious modal correlations.

Result: RiSe achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance in multimodal FAS through theoretical and experimental validation.

Conclusion: RiSe effectively improves cross-domain multimodal FAS generalization by addressing invariant representation and synergy risks.

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

### [138] [MVI-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness to Misleading Visual Inputs in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14159)
*Huiyi Chen,Jiawei Peng,Dehai Min,Changchang Sun,Kaijie Chen,Yan Yan,Xu Yang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVI-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate how misleading visual inputs impact the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks emphasize textual inputs while neglecting the significant role of misleading visual inputs in evaluating the robustness of LVLMs for visual understanding.

Method: The authors designed a hierarchical taxonomy of misleading visual inputs based on visual primitives: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. They curated 1,248 annotated Visual Question Answering (VQA) instances under six categories and proposed a novel metric, MVI-Sensitivity, for fine-grained robustness evaluation.

Result: Results reveal vulnerabilities in 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs to misleading visual inputs. The study provides detailed analysis using MVI-Bench.

Conclusion: MVI-Bench helps identify weaknesses in LVLMs and offers actionable insights for improving their robustness in handling visual inputs.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

*Xinliang Zhang,Lei Zhu,Hangzhou He,Shuang Zeng,Ourui Fu,Jiakui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses computational inefficiencies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) caused by traditional patch-level tokenization. It introduces an object-level token merging strategy to significantly reduce tokens while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of computational overhead and cognitive mismatch in MLLMs caused by patch-level tokenization, aiming to align tokenization closer with human vision systems.

Method: The authors propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, which reduces the number of tokens without significantly compromising performance.

Result: Experiments reveal that the proposed method uses only 10% of the tokens needed by the vanilla model while retaining approximately 96% of its performance, outperforming related approaches in balancing compression efficiency and model performance.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential for more efficient and human vision-aligned MLLMs, with a significant reduction in computation and memory needs, paving the way for practical and high-performing implementations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

*Yanshan Li,Ke Ma,Miaomiao Wei,Linhui Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DoGCLR, a self-supervised framework using game theory for improved skeleton-based action recognition, addressing motion region processing and negative sample selection challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing self-supervised methods that uniformly process skeleton regions and use a FIFO queue causing motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection.

Method: Introduces a dynamic Dominance Game model that optimizes positive and negative sample construction, uses spatio-temporal mechanisms to identify key motion regions and entropy-driven strategies for selective memory bank management.

Result: DoGCLR achieves notable performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: DoGCLR provides a novel framework that significantly enhances skeleton-based action recognition by addressing key challenges in data processing and sample selection.

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSER is a versatile model addressing diverse 'soft effect' degradations, outperforming specialist and generalist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing models for degrading effects like lens flare and haze are often specialized and lack scalability, while existing generalist tools fail to achieve robust restoration and scene preservation.

Method: UniSER utilizes a 3.8M-pair dataset and a tailored training pipeline to fine-tune a Diffusion Transformer, integrating mask and strength controls.

Result: UniSER achieves robust restoration, outperforming current specialized or generalist models across diverse soft effect degradations.

Conclusion: UniSER effectively addresses soft effect degradations with high fidelity, leveraging shared problem essence and improving over existing solutions.

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on overcoming the limited capability of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to comprehend abstract hand-drawn sketches, by introducing a novel dataset and a new model, O3SLM, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) struggle to interpret sketches due to the lack of a comprehensive dataset that combines sketches, photorealistic images, and natural language instructions. Sketches offer an intuitive way to express complex concepts that might be hard to describe in text.

Method: The authors introduced a large dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets for both pretraining and instruction tuning. They also developed O3SLM, an LVLM specifically trained on this new dataset.

Result: O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks, including object localization, sketch-based image retrieval, counting, and visual question answering, when compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and the O3SLM model significantly enhance LVLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about sketches, demonstrating advancement in handling abstract visual inputs.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GloTok, a tokenizer that improves image reconstruction and generation by modeling a more uniform semantic distribution via global relational information, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for image tokenization leverage pre-trained vision models and focus on locally supervised approaches, which limit uniform distribution of semantic features. The authors aim to address this issue to enhance generation performance.

Method: The Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok) models uniform semantic distributions by introducing a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method to transfer semantics from pre-trained models to the semantic codebook. Additionally, a residual learning module is employed to recover fine-grained details and minimize reconstruction error.

Result: GloTok demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction and generation on ImageNet-1k benchmark, with improved semantic uniformity and no need for direct pre-trained model usage during training.

Conclusion: GloTok achieves better semantic distribution and reconstruction accuracy, providing a robust method for high-quality image generation free from reliance on pre-trained models during training.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

*Xiangyu Li,Chen Wang,Yumao Liu,Dengbo He,Jiahao Zhang,Ke Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dataset collected entirely in autonomous-driving mode, designed for AV behavior analysis and safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous-driving datasets are insufficient for evaluating AVs’ real-world behavioral safety as they lack data collected in autonomous-driving mode.

Method: The dataset captures 100+ hours of data from autonomous-driving vehicles, segmented into key frames with synchronized camera images, GNSS/IMU data, vehicle trajectories, and detailed annotations.

Result: The authors test an end-to-end motion planning model using the dataset, achieving an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m.

Conclusion: This dataset offers rich attributes for AV safety research and is continuously expanding, creating a sustainable basis for improving AV behavioral safety.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

*Zhaoyu Liu,Kan Jiang,Murong Ma,Zhe Hou,Yun Lin,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of precise event spotting (PES) in sports analytics by introducing UMEG-Net, a model utilizing human skeletons and object keypoints. It achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise event spotting in sports analytics is hampered by the need for large labeled datasets, rapid event succession, and visual complexity, making it difficult to perform under few-shot conditions.

Method: The authors propose UMEG-Net, a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network combining human skeletons and object keypoints into a unified graph via spatio-temporal GCNs and multi-scale temporal shifts. Additionally, multimodal distillation is used to transfer graph-based knowledge to visual forms.

Result: UMEG-Net achieves robust performance under limited labeled data conditions and outperforms baseline models in few-shot PES.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net provides a scalable, efficient, and effective solution for precise event spotting with few-shot data, advancing sports analytics in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

*Pengcheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a curriculum learning strategy with a novel fractal softmax for 3D anatomical analysis of aortic structures, addressing hierarchical relationships and class imbalance, ultimately improving segmentation accuracy and efficiency for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the segmentation of aortic structures for minimally invasive interventions by addressing the challenges of hierarchical relationships and class imbalance in vascular structures.

Method: The method employs a curriculum learning strategy inspired by human cognition, using a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. It progressively learns from simple to complex structures, establishing robust feature representations and enhancing model efficiency.

Result: The model achieves significant performance improvements, including an 11.65% Dice score increase at epoch 50 and a 5.6% higher Dice score than benchmarks, along with up to fivefold acceleration in inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time clinical use, with the implementation code and fractal softmax method publicly available.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24. The code for fractal softmax will be available at https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/fractal-softmax.

### [147] [Online Data Curation for Object Detection via Marginal Contributions to Dataset-level Average Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14197)
*Zitang Sun,Masakazu Yoshimura,Junji Otsuka,Atsushi Irie,Takeshi Ohashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DetGain, a new method for dynamically selecting training samples in object detection tasks to improve dataset-level accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by the challenge of extending online data curation strategies, successful in other domains, to object detection, where complexities such as structural intricacies and domain gaps exist.

Method: The authors introduced DetGain, a minimally intrusive, architecture-agnostic method that estimates the marginal impact of data samples on dataset-level Average Precision (AP). DetGain uses global prediction score distributions and teacher-student contribution metrics to dynamically select impactful training samples during iterations.

Result: Experimental evaluations on the COCO dataset with various object detectors showed consistent improvements in accuracy, even with low-quality data. The method also worked effectively in combination with knowledge distillation techniques.

Conclusion: DetGain is presented as a versatile and efficient approach for data curation in object detection. It enhances performance across various architectures and demonstrates robustness, making it a promising tool for data-efficient training.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

### [148] [Multi-Scale Correlation-Aware Transformer for Maritime Vessel Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14203)
*Yunhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCFormer, a vessel re-identification method that outperforms existing strategies by addressing intra-identity variation and missing local parts using multi-scale correlation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel Re-ID methods primarily adapt pedestrian-based models, which fail to account for vessel-specific challenges such as greater intra-identity variation and missing local parts, creating a need for novel strategies.

Method: MCFormer is proposed with two core modules: a Global Correlation Module (GCM) for global feature aggregation and a Local Correlation Module (LCM) for compensating missing regions via local correlation mining. Features are enhanced by integrating these correlated features across scales.

Result: MCFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in experiments conducted across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MCFormer method effectively mitigates issues unique to maritime vessel Re-ID (e.g., intra-identity variations, local part occlusions) and improves monitoring and situational awareness systems.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Weimin Bai,Suzhe Xu,Yiwei Ren,Jinhua Hao,Ming Sun,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR leverages a pre-trained video diffusion model for ultra-fast video restoration using a single forward pass, achieving real-time processing speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving high perceptual quality video reconstruction under tight latency constraints.

Method: The authors distill a bidirectional video diffusion model into a causal autoregressive model. Additionally, they employ a novel teacher-space regularization and replace the VAE backbone with LeanVAE for efficiency.

Result: InstantViR performs real-time restoration at over 35 FPS, delivers reconstruction quality comparable to diffusion-based baselines, and achieves up to 100 times speedups over traditional methods.

Conclusion: InstantViR demonstrates that diffusion-based video reconstruction can be seamlessly integrated into real-time streaming with high reconstruction quality and speed.

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Measurement-Constrained Sampling approach to improve blind face restoration by generating diverse face reconstructions based on textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing deterministic methods in blind face restoration and enable multiple plausible high-quality results under low-quality inputs.

Method: Formulates BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task using controlled degradations and measurement constraints, enabling posterior-guided sampling within a text-to-image diffusion framework.

Result: The proposed MCS method generates diverse, prompt-aligned results under BFR tasks and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively tackles the one-to-many nature of blind face restoration and demonstrates superior performance compared to current methods.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for speech-driven 3D facial animations struggle with processing long audio sequences, resulting in delays and performance issues. The authors aim to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a streaming autoregressive diffusion model combining past frame motion contexts with audio inputs. This approach ensures flexibility with audio length, low latency, and high animation quality.

Result: The proposed model successfully enables real-time, high-quality facial motion synthesis regardless of audio length. A real-time demo was implemented to showcase its efficiency.

Conclusion: The authors demonstrate that their streaming diffusion model offers a solution for real-time, synchronized, and realistic speech-driven 3D animations with scalable performance.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

### [153] [Breaking the Passive Learning Trap: An Active Perception Strategy for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14237)
*Juncheng Hu,Zijian Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Guoyu Wang,Yingji Li,Kedi Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for forecasting 3D human motion by employing quotient space representations and auxiliary learning objectives, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to 3D human motion prediction rely too heavily on implicit spatiotemporal network modeling, which results in redundant data acquisition and lacks active, explicit learning mechanisms.

Method: The proposed APS involves two key components: (1) a data perception module that uses quotient space to decouple motion geometry from redundant coordinate data while enforcing dynamic constraints and (2) a network perception module that uses restorative learning by masking joints or injecting noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. APS can be integrated with various prediction models.

Result: The proposed APS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by substantial margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: APS effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by explicitly encoding motion properties and enhancing spatiotemporal dependencies through active perception. It is model-agnostic, offering broad applicability in improving 3D human motion forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeSTAR improves the generalization of monocular depth estimation foundation models utilizing weak supervision, hierarchical normalization, and self-training adaptation with regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the zero-shot generalization capabilities of MDE foundation models while adapting them to unseen and diverse domains.

Method: WeSTAR employs dense self-training for structural supervision, semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, cost-efficient weak supervision with pairwise ordinal depth annotations, and weight regularization loss for stable training.

Result: WeSTAR consistently enhances robustness and achieves state-of-the-art generalization on multiple benchmarks across realistic and corrupted datasets under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: WeSTAR demonstrates effectiveness in improving generalization performance of MDE foundation models, making them more robust across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of achieving consistent feature alignment in collaborative perception when GNSS-based localization fails in GNSS-denied environments.

Method: The proposed framework includes a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) for pose estimation, the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT) for spatial and temporal alignment, and introduces the V2VLoc dataset for evaluation.

Result: The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions on the V2VLoc dataset and proves to be effective and generalizable on the real-world V2V4Real dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed GNSS-free collaborative perception framework is robust, effective, and contributes to advancements in multi-agent perception, especially in GNSS-denied settings.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Motivation: Traditional benchmarks for image manipulation detection lack diversity, coverage of advanced generative models, and sufficient interpretability, limiting the effectiveness of current detection methods.

Method: The authors developed ManipBench, a dataset with over 450K manipulated images (with annotations for some) and created ManipShield, a Multimodal Large Language Model leveraging contrastive LoRA fine-tuning for unified manipulation detection, localization, and explanation.

Result: ManipShield demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and generalizability to unseen manipulation models during testing on ManipBench and public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed tools, ManipBench and ManipShield, address existing benchmark limitations and advance the field in detecting, localizing, and explaining AI-manipulated images.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the GSLR framework to improve multi-dimensional image representation by addressing limitations in current t-SVD methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) methods struggle with coarse latent tensor approximations and fixed basis atoms in transform matrix, which fail to effectively capture local high-frequency information in multi-dimensional images.

Method: The authors propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework that uses 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting for latent tensor and transform matrix generation, offering enhanced representation, especially for capturing local high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GSLR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-dimensional image recovery tasks, especially excelling in capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: The GSLR framework represents a promising advancement in compact and continuous representation of multi-dimensional images, addressing critical shortcomings in existing t-SVD methods and setting a new benchmark in multi-dimensional image representation.

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLM3D, a framework that utilizes large vision-language models (VLMs) as semantic and spatial critics to improve Text-to-3D generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-3D generation models face semantic misalignment and geometric inconsistencies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: VLM3D leverages vision-language models to provide dual-query critic signals assessing semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. These signals are used as rewards in optimization-based pipelines and guidance in feed-forward pipelines.

Result: VLM3D significantly improves semantic alignment and spatial consistency across varied pipelines, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: VLM3D offers a generalized approach to integrate VLMs into 3D generative systems, improving both semantic and spatial outcomes.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges of semantic disjoint, domain discrepancy, and data scarcity in transferring knowledge from a source domain to target domains with limited data in CDFSL.

Method: The method constructs Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDPs) using source feature embeddings as a codebook to reconstruct target domain features, while incorporating domain alignment through collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation.

Result: The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art approaches across 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: By leveraging IDPs and utilizing them for domain alignment, the approach improves feature transformations across domains and demonstrates superior performance in CDFSL.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for implicit surface reconstruction often lack mechanisms to tightly fit input data. The need exists for a robust approach that ensures adherence to input point clouds while maintaining shape accuracy and handling topological changes.

Method: The paper introduces NeuralSSD with a novel energy equation and a convolutional network designed to learn 3-dimensional information. It optimizes surface reconstruction by balancing reliability from input point clouds and applying neural methods.

Result: NeuralSSD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing 3D surfaces with higher accuracy and generalization, validated on datasets like ShapeNet and Matterport.

Conclusion: NeuralSSD is effective for accurate and stable reconstruction of 3D surfaces from point cloud data, addressing inadequacies in current implicit field parameterizations and achieving superior results.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

TL;DR: NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised 3D point cloud registration framework, aligns bone surfaces for cross-modal orthopedic surgery with high accuracy, surpassing existing methods across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In CAOS, accurate alignment between preoperative surgical plans and intraoperative data across different imaging modalities is crucial but challenging due to significant modality heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised framework using implicit neural unsigned distance fields (UDF) and MLP-based modules for surface registration of bones using 3D point clouds, avoiding inter-subject training data.

Result: NeuralBoneReg exhibits superior or competitive performance against existing approaches across three datasets, achieving low mean rotational and translational errors (e.g., 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k).

Conclusion: The approach shows strong generalizability across various anatomical regions and imaging modalities, offering robust and accurate cross-modal registrations crucial for orthopedic surgery workflows.

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed effectively addresses limitations in federated semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation and enhances performance through improved pseudo-label quality and client-server coordination.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework for improving CT image quality under ultra-sparse-view sampling, using projection synthesis and refinement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-sparse-view sampling in multi-source stationary computed tomography degrades image reconstruction quality, presenting challenges in clinical and industrial applications.

Method: Diff-NAF employs iterative refinement by combining Neural Attenuation Fields with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model, enhancing projection quality and reconstruction fidelity.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that Diff-NAF outperforms traditional methods in delivering high-quality CT reconstructions under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF offers a robust solution for improved CT reconstruction quality in ultra-sparse-view scenarios, making it viable for time-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

TL;DR: Dental3R proposes a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for intraoral 3D reconstruction from sparse photographs, overcoming challenges like sparse views and illumination inconsistencies to achieve high-fidelity dental occlusion visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intraoral scanning is inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, and current methods face challenges with sparse imagery and unstable pose/geometry estimation in clinical settings.

Method: Dental3R employs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select image pairs, stabilize geometry initialization, and reduce memory usage. It then trains a 3D Gaussian Splatting model with a wavelet-regularized objective to preserve dental details while suppressing artifacts.

Result: Validated on large-scale clinical datasets, Dental3R achieves enhanced 3D reconstructions, improving quality and accuracy for sparse-view dental occlusion visualization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Dental3R provides a robust solution to remote orthodontic visualization, delivering high-fidelity 3D reconstructions from sparse intraoral photographs and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Growing health concerns caused by poor sitting posture due to sedentary lifestyles require efficient recognition methods suitable for real-time application.

Method: LSP-YOLO combines partial convolution, Similarity-Aware Activation Module, lightweight module Light-C3k2, and efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification using intermediate supervision.

Result: LSP-YOLO-n achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 FPS with only 1.9 MB model size on PC, and demonstrated real-time high-accuracy inference on constrained computational platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed LSP-YOLO is highly efficient, lightweight, and deployable, making it suitable for applications like smart classrooms and rehabilitation.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StepsNet, a novel architecture addressing limitations in deep residual networks by progressively learning features with increasing width, leading to superior performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite deeper networks theoretically offering greater capability, existing architectures struggle to fully realize this potential due to shortcut degradation and limited width.

Method: StepsNet proposes separating features along the channel dimension and using progressively wider stacking blocks to overcome depth-related issues.

Result: StepsNet consistently outperforms traditional residual models in tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling.

Conclusion: StepsNet effectively bridges the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance in deep models, showcasing its versatility and superiority over existing designs.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

TL;DR: ArchMap is a training-free framework enhancing 3D intraoral scan analysis for digital orthodontics by combining geometric normalization and ontology-based multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with modality-specific limitations, reliance on large datasets, and variable intraoral mesh conditions, hindering practical use in real clinical workflows.

Method: ArchMap introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module for aligning 3D meshes and employs a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) for symbolic reasoning using hierarchical tooth ontology and clinical semantics.

Result: Tested on 1060 orthodontic cases, ArchMap outperforms supervised methods in accuracy, stability, and semantic reasoning, even under challenging conditions like sparse data and artifacts.

Conclusion: ArchMap offers a scalable and practical solution for structured 3D scan analysis in digital orthodontics, enabling robust performance without training requirements.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DentalSCR, a framework for improved alignment of intraoral scans and cephalometric radiographs in orthodontic diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods fail in clinical scenarios due to magnification, distortion, low contrast, and acquisition variability issues in radiographs.

Method: DentalSCR stabilizes alignment by constructing a unified anatomical coordinate system, generating radiograph-like projections, and optimizing similarity transforms using Chamfer distance.

Result: Experimental testing on 34 cases shows DentalSCR reduces landmark errors, tightens posterior jaw alignment, and improves curve-level consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DentalSCR enhances 3D-2D alignment accuracy and clinical interpretability, proving superior to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Motivation: There is a growing need to efficiently structure long videos as existing methods rely on small-scale, coarse annotations and cannot generalize to complex transitions.

Method: The authors created a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset unifying ASR transcripts, scene texts, and visual captions into hierarchical annotations and trained ARC-Chapter on extensive data.

Result: ARC-Chapter outperformed existing models significantly, with a 14.0% improvement in F1 score and 11.3% increase in SODA score. The model also improved dense video captioning on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: ARC-Chapter sets a new benchmark in video chaptering and showcases its transferability across related video analysis tasks, highlighting the benefits of large-scale data utilization and precise evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Image-Based Gaussian Splatting (IBGS) to improve rendering quality for novel view synthesis, addressing limitations in Gaussian Splatting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, such as their inability to handle spatially varying color and view-dependent effects efficiently.

Method: IBGS combines a base color from standard 3DGS rendering with a learned residual from nearby training images to enhance rendering quality.

Result: Experiments on NVS benchmarks show IBGS significantly improves quality while maintaining storage efficiency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: IBGS enhances rendering quality and view-dependent effects in novel view synthesis without increasing storage overhead, presenting a more efficient approach.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

TL;DR: Infrared UAV target images are severely impacted by motion blur, harming detection performance. JFD3 framework addresses this via a dual-branch design combining deblurring with detection using shared weights and effective feature enhancement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur in infrared UAV images hinders target detection, as feature representation between target and background becomes less discriminative, challenging detection performance improvements.

Method: JFD3 framework employs a dual-branch architecture with shared weights. It introduces a lightweight feature restoration network where the clear branch guides the blurred branch, utilizing structural feature refinement and self-supervised feature consistency loss.

Result: Experiments using the benchmark database IRBlurUAV (containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real blurred images) reveal that JFD3 achieves superior detection capability with real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: JFD3 enables effective feature enhancement under blurred conditions, improving infrared UAV target detection and offering real-time performance.

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Motivation: Biometric identity standards enforce shoulder pose requirements, but current automated tools lack quantitative methods for evaluating this aspect.

Method: The SPE algorithm uses 3D shoulder landmark coordinates provided by pose estimation frameworks to measure shoulder yaw and roll.

Result: SPE scores show a strong Pearson correlation (~0.80) with human-assigned labels, and effectively filter non-compliant samples based on Error-versus-Discard analysis.

Conclusion: The algorithm is a lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in biometric enrolment systems, filling a gap in current methodologies.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

### [175] [Cheating Stereo Matching in Full-scale: Physical Adversarial Attack against Binocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14386)
*Kangqiao Zhao,Shuo Huai,Xurui Song,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the first 3D texture-enabled physical adversarial attack targeting stereo depth estimation models in autonomous driving, demonstrating its effectiveness in deceiving stereo models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored vulnerability of stereo-based binocular depth estimation models to adversarial examples, especially within the context of autonomous driving.

Method: The proposed method creates 3D physical adversarial examples (PAEs) with global camouflage texture to maintain attack consistency across stereo camera viewpoints. Additionally, a custom stereo rendering module ensures proper alignment in a 3D binocular vision environment. A novel merging attack technique is introduced to seamlessly integrate PAEs into backgrounds for enhanced stealth and effectiveness.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates that these PAEs can successfully deceive stereo matching models, causing them to generate incorrect depth estimations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerability of stereo vision systems to physical adversarial attacks and provides an effective approach to exploit this weakness, emphasizing the need for improved robustness in such models.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

*Fabian Schmidt,Noushiq Mohammed Kayilan Abdul Nazar,Markus Enzweiler,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduction of TLS-Assist, enhancing LLM-based autonomous driving by improving recognition of traffic lights and signs to achieve better performance and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based autonomous driving agents lack effective mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and struggle in detecting safety-critical objects like traffic lights and signs.

Method: TLS-Assist adds a modular redundancy layer that recognizes traffic lights and signs, converts detections into structured messages, and injects these into LLM input for explicit attention to safety-critical cues.

Result: Evaluation on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA shows up to 14% driving performance improvement over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, reducing traffic infractions.

Conclusion: TLS-Assist improves reliability and safety in LLM-based autonomous driving systems by integrating explicit traffic light and sign recognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEDLAM2.0 is a new dataset that improves upon BEDLAM for 3D human motion estimation, particularly in world coordinates, by introducing diverse cameras, motions, body types, clothing, environments, and shoes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of estimating 3D human motion in world coordinates from video, particularly when both human and camera motion are dynamic. Insufficient datasets hinder progress in this complex area.

Method: The authors introduce BEDLAM2.0, an enhanced dataset that incorporates greater diversity and realism in camera movements, body shapes, motions, clothing, hair, environments, and includes shoes. They compare methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0 to analyze improvements.

Result: BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods for estimating 3D human motions in world coordinates, outperforming the original BEDLAM dataset.

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0 provides superior data for training models in estimating 3D human motion, making it a valuable resource for advancing this field. It offers rendered data, ground truth body parameters, camera motions, 3D assets, and third-party links for research.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

### [179] [Language as an Anchor: Preserving Relative Visual Geometry for Domain Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14401)
*Shuyi Geng,Tao Zhou,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) by introducing LAVA, a framework leveraging text-based semantic anchors for robust feature alignment and knowledge retention, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) caused by inter-domain interference, semantic distortion, knowledge fragmentation, and forgetting when dealing with shifting distributions.

Method: The proposed method, LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), uses a text-based semantic anchor to ensure relative alignment of visual features across domains, preserving pairwise semantic relationships instead of direct feature alignment.

Result: Experiments on standard DIL benchmarks show that LAVA significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving knowledge and achieving robust cross-domain learning.

Conclusion: LAVA successfully addresses the limitations of prior DIL approaches by using a text-based anchor for visual alignment, enabling improved feature aggregation and knowledge reuse, with substantial performance gains.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

*Ravi Shankar Prasad,Nandani Sharma,Dinesh Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Cranio-ID that uses advanced methods for automatically identifying landmarks on 2D skull X-rays and matching them with corresponding facial images, enabling improved forensic craniofacial identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional craniometric landmark identification methods are time-consuming and require expert knowledge. Current automated systems lack reliability due to insufficient large-scale validations, causing issues in forensic and biomedical applications.

Method: The authors proposed Cranio-ID, which utilizes YOLO-pose models for automatic 2D skull landmark annotation and performs cross-modal matching via graph-based representations using cross-attention and optimal transport frameworks.

Result: The proposed framework was validated using S2F and CUHK datasets, showing significant improvements in accuracy and reliability for skull-to-face and sketch-to-face forensic identification.

Conclusion: Cranio-ID demonstrates effective and reliable landmark annotation and cross-modal matching in forensic sciences, representing a notable advancement in craniofacial identification methods.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

*Yusen Cai,Bhargava Satya Nunna,Qing Lin,Mengmi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, CATDiet, which uses staged visual experiences similar to infant vision in self-supervised learning models, improving robustness and biologically realistic developmental patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the developmental advantages of infant-like visual experiences in self-supervised learning models for creating robust visual intelligence.

Method: Self-supervised learning models were trained using constraints reflecting infant vision—grayscale-to-color, blur-to-sharp, and temporal continuity, evaluated across various benchmarks.

Result: CATDiet models showed enhanced object recognition robustness, biologically aligned patterns in neural development and behavior, outperforming standard models in object and depth recognition using CombDiet.

Conclusion: Infant visual developmental progression can serve as an effective framework for developing robust visual intelligence in machines.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

TL;DR: Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI) is a framework for video understanding combining reasoning LLMs, lightweight CV models, and structured entity graphs for effective comprehension without reliance on proprietary systems or extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in iterative video comprehension and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to find a training-free solution with robust interpretability and flexible system design.

Method: This study introduces a three-phase reasoning process, structured video knowledge bases utilizing entity graphs, and model ensembles to facilitate effective video reasoning without costly proprietary APIs or agentic RL training.

Result: AVI demonstrated competitive performance on benchmark datasets like LVBench and Charades-STA, offering clarity and insight into its reasoning process.

Conclusion: AVI provides a system-level advancement in video intelligence, combining flexibility, interpretability, and competitive accuracy without dependencies on specialized proprietary systems or intensive agent training.

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in current single-query text-to-image retrieval methods by introducing progressive and interactive refinement through multi-turn dialogues for better accuracy and user experience.

Method: The proposed DIR-TIR framework utilizes two modules: (1) the Dialog Refiner Module, which queries users for more precise target image descriptions, and (2) the Image Refiner Module, which identifies and minimizes discrepancies between user intent and generated images.

Result: DIR-TIR demonstrated superior retrieval precision compared to baselines, significantly improving accuracy and delivering an improved interactive experience across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully boosts text-to-image retrieval through dialogue-driven modular refinement, proving its efficacy in improving hit accuracy and user controllability.

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of interactive, conversational text-to-image retrieval.
  Our DIR-TIR framework progressively refines the target image search through two specialized modules: the Dialog Refiner Module and the Image Refiner Module.
  The Dialog Refiner actively queries users to extract essential information and generate increasingly precise descriptions of the target image.
  Complementarily, the Image Refiner identifies perceptual gaps between generated images and user intentions, strategically reducing the visual-semantic discrepancy. By leveraging multi-turn dialogues, DIR-TIR provides superior controllability and fault tolerance compared to conventional single-query methods, significantly improving target image hit accuracy.
  Comprehensive experiments across diverse image datasets demonstrate our dialogue-based approach substantially outperforms initial-description-only baselines, while the synergistic module integration achieves both higher retrieval precision and enhanced interactive experience.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompEvent, a neural network framework that combines event data and RGB frames to enhance low-light video deblurring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light video deblurring is difficult due to dim lighting and motion blur, and existing methods lack effective solutions. Event cameras provide unique advantages but fusion techniques need improvements.

Method: CompEvent uses a complex-valued neural network for holistic fusion of event data and RGB frames. It includes Complex Temporal Alignment GRU for iterative fusion and alignment, and Complex Space-Frequency Learning for deep processing in spatial and frequency domains.

Result: CompEvent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-light video deblurring tasks as shown by extensive experimentation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances joint restoration capabilities, demonstrating strong complementary learning between event data and RGB frames.

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate subglacial bed topography is crucial for ice sheet modeling, but radar observations are insufficient and irregular.

Method: A DeepLabV3+ decoder with physics-based and data-driven constraints is used to reconstruct bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior test-core accuracy and structural fidelity compared to several baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: The model combines physics and residual design to yield coherent, plausible bed representations suitable for practical applications under domain shifts.

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

Motivation: To address inefficiencies in existing optimal transport schemes during training in computer vision tasks by developing a non-iterative, efficient transport mechanism.

Method: Uses Gaussian splatting to compute pixel-annotation correspondences and derives a Bayesian transport plan, with a loss function for integration into standard network optimization.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on tasks like crowd counting and landmark detection, achieving better efficiency and performance than conventional methods.

Conclusion: GST streamlines transport plan computation, reducing training inefficiency in computer vision, setting a new direction for efficient task optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEED-SR, a method that combines conditional latent diffusion and geo-spatial foundation models to address farm boundary delineation via segmentation-aware super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of smallholder farm boundaries requires high-resolution imagery, which is limited by revisit frequency. Combining HR images with frequently revisited low-resolution ones for segmentation lacks effective methods.

Method: SEED-SR adopts segmentation-aware super-resolution within latent spaces by leveraging conditional latent diffusion models and multi-source foundation models for agricultural applications.

Result: The proposed SEED-SR achieves significant improvements (up to 25.5% in instance segmentation and 12.9% in semantic segmentation metrics) when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: By innovatively performing super-resolution in segmentation-aware latent spaces, SEED-SR overcomes limitations of two-step approaches and sets a new benchmark for agricultural image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand task-level interactions and enhance dense prediction in multi-task learning, addressing limitations of convolutional and Transformer-based models.

Method: Proposes PAMM, utilizing state space models, dual state space parameter experts, and Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning for improved task interconnectivity and feature perception.

Result: The method is validated on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks, showing significant effectiveness.

Conclusion: PAMM improves multi-task dense predictions and inter-task relationships using novel state space techniques and enhanced feature interaction strategies.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: This paper introduces D-PerceptCT, an advanced method to enhance LDCT image quality, preserving anatomical structures and pathological details through novel architectures and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the limitations of existing LDCT enhancement methods that over-smooth images and lose critical diagnostic details.

Method: The proposed solution involves a novel architecture, D-PerceptCT, comprising two components: ViDex for semantic-awareness and capturing spatial features, and a Global-Local State-Space block for preserving anatomical and fine details. Additionally, a Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF) is introduced to emphasize perceptually significant features based on human contrast sensitivity.

Result: Experimental results on the Mayo2016 dataset show that D-PerceptCT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving structural and textural information in LDCT images.

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT enhances LDCT images effectively, ensuring radiologically relevant features are preserved, benefiting diagnostic accuracy and clinical applications.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

*Yufeng Tian,Yifan Chen,Zhe Sun,Libang Chen,Mingyu Dou,Jijun Lu,Ye Zheng,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a scalable solution for underwater image restoration using synthetic datasets with unambiguous reference labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for underwater image enhancement are limited by a lack of high-quality paired datasets.

Method: The authors propose using in-air natural images as references and translating them into underwater-degraded versions to create synthetic datasets.

Result: Models trained on the synthetic data show superior performance in color restoration and generalization compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a reliable dataset solution for underwater image enhancement, and the generated datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement. The generated dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/yftian2025/SynUIEDatasets.git.

*Xiangchen Yin,Jiahui Yuan,Zhangchi Hu,Wenzhang Sun,Jie Chen,Xiaozhen Qiao,Hao Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeCo-VAE to improve video VAE performance by decoupling frame components (keyframe, motion, residual) for compact representation and better reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs often fail to leverage frame content similarity, causing redundant latent modeling.

Method: DeCo-VAE decomposes video into keyframe, motion, and residual components, uses dedicated encoders for each, a shared 3D decoder, and applies sequential encoder adaptation for stable training.

Result: DeCo-VAE achieves better video reconstruction performance in experiments compared to conventional video VAEs.

Conclusion: By decoupling video components and employing focused learning strategies, DeCo-VAE enhances video VAE efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

*Qiang Bai,Bojian Wu,Xi Yang,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to better represent multiple neural signed distance functions (SDFs), improving fidelity and compactness in 3D shape representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDF methods face challenges in handling multiple high-fidelity geometries due to latent space limitations and loss of geometry details.

Method: The authors propose leveraging both generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, alongside a novel sampling technique to efficiently train and reduce artifacts in SDF representation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior representative ability and compactness compared to recent methods, validated through numerical and visual evaluations on benchmark data.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves SDF representation for multiple shapes, enhancing both compactness and geometry fidelity.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to model hand-object interaction scenes using dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in capturing complex hand-object interactions without relying on object priors.

Method: Introduced interaction-aware Gaussian parameters, dynamic field modeling using hand-object complementarity, and a progressive optimization strategy with explicit regularizations.

Result: The proposed approach exhibits superior performance in reconstructing hand-object interactions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a novel interaction-aware model that effectively handles occlusions, edge blur, and dynamic lighting, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework combining RGB, texture, and frequency analysis for superior Deepfake video detection, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose threats to information integrity and societal stability. Existing detection methods, like single-stream CNNs, don't effectively capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains.

Method: ForensicFlow synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence using specialized branches (ConvNeXt-tiny for RGB, Swin Transformer-tiny for texture, CNN+SE for frequency), attention-based temporal pooling, and adaptive attention fusion. It uses Celeb-DF (v2) dataset and Focal Loss for training.

Result: ForensicFlow achieved outstanding performance with AUC of 0.9752, F1-Score of 0.9408, and accuracy of 0.9208, surpassing single-stream CNN baselines.

Conclusion: Comprehensive fusion of RGB, texture, and frequency features in ForensicFlow enhances resilience against subtle Deepfake manipulations and improves video forensic robustness.

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and reliability of convolutional neural network models in digital pathology, surpassing the limitations of single-slide-focused saliency map techniques.

Method: The method clusters model outputs to generate insights into its global behavior, offering detailed information beyond what saliency maps like GradCAM or occlusion provide.

Result: The method is visualized and applied to an existing prostate cancer detection model, highlighting its practical utility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This technique not only aids in understanding neural network behavior but can also boost confidence in model adoption for clinical applications, accelerating its integration into medical practice.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniZip is a training-free framework that compresses multimodal audio-video tokens for faster inference and reduced memory usage in OmniLLMs, maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the computational challenges posed by processing audio-video token sequences in Omnimodal Large Language Models, aiming to unify audio-visual understanding.

Method: OmniZip identifies key audio tokens, computes audio retention scores, guides video token pruning based on preservation cues, and uses an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme for video token compression.

Result: OmniZip achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction compared to leading methods, without compromising model performance.

Conclusion: OmniZip effectively optimizes multimodal token representation, improving computational efficiency for OmniLLMs with innovations in training-free multimodal processing.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework for WMH segmentation and localization, emphasizing regional lesion analysis for improved diagnostic outcomes in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WMH segmentation methods primarily focus on global lesion load and fail to address spatial distribution, which limits their diagnostic utility in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Method: A robust deep learning framework is developed for WMH segmentation and localization, combining automated regional quantification with brain structure volumes and evaluating diagnostic relevance.

Result: Predicted WMH loads align with reference estimates. Regional WMH volumes outperform global lesion burden in classification tasks, with diagnostic performance improving further when combined with atrophy metrics (AUC up to 0.97).

Conclusion: Regional WMH quantification enhances diagnostic precision and highlights localized vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, offering potential for improved early diagnosis and disease stratification.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework to handle missing MRI modalities for brain tumor segmentation, achieving robust state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing MRI modalities in clinical settings limit segmentation model performance, necessitating a method to handle arbitrary modality combinations.

Method: The CCSD framework uses a shared-specific encoder-decoder, hierarchical modality self-distillation to reduce discrepancies, and progressive modality dropout for training robustness.

Result: CCSD demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation across various missing-modality scenarios on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach ensures strong generalization, high robustness, and stable segmentation performance even with incomplete input modalities.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study examines the use of tabular predictors and MRI-based transformer-derived embeddings to model cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, introducing trajectory-aware labeling and highlighting complementary strengths between modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early stratification and personalized management of Alzheimer’s disease by exploring predictive contributions of tabular and advanced MRI-based approaches.

Method: Developed a labeling strategy using Dynamic Time Warping clustering for heterogeneous cognitive patterns and pretrained a 3D Vision Transformer on augmented MRI data for embedding extraction. Evaluations were made with machine learning classifiers and deep learning models.

Result: Clinical and volumetric features performed best for predicting extreme decline (AUC ~ 0.70), while transformer-based MRI embeddings were most accurate for detecting stability (AUC ~ 0.71). However, challenges appeared in capturing moderate patterns.

Conclusion: Clinical features are reliable for identifying significant risks, and MRI embeddings from transformers are sensitive to minor stability changes. Encourages multimodal fusion for holistic AD progression predictions.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing poor bone health and its link to osteoporosis, the paper aims to improve early detection of low BMD through enhanced multimodal predictive methods.

Method: XAttn-BMD employs a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to integrate image and metadata dynamically, combined with a Weighted Smooth L1 loss function to tackle data imbalance.

Result: The model significantly enhances prediction accuracy, showing marked improvements in metrics like MSE, MAE, and R2 score, while succeeding in clinically relevant BMD threshold screenings.

Conclusion: Cross-attention multimodal integration proves effective for BMD prediction, offering potential for real-world applications in osteoporosis risk assessment.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding 3D tissue organization is crucial to deepen insights into human biology and disease.

Method: Introduces HoloTea, a scalable 3D-aware flow-matching algorithm utilizing cross-section spatial features and a ZINB prior, improving gene expression prediction accuracy.

Result: HoloTea achieves better 3D expression accuracy and generalization across multiple datasets compared to existing 2D/3D solutions.

Conclusion: HoloTea can advance the development of virtual 3D tissues, aiding in biomarker discovery and improved understanding of diseases.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

*Md Fokhrul Islam,Sajeda Al-Hammouri,Christopher J. Arellano,Kavan Hazeli,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces BioST-GCN, a novel fall prediction model combining pose and biomechanical data, achieving high F1-scores in simulated settings but facing challenges in generalization to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls among older adults significantly impact injury rates and independence. Vision-based fall prediction systems can provide non-invasive solutions, but development is limited by scarce fall data.

Method: The BioST-GCN model integrates pose and biomechanical information through a cross-attention fusion mechanism, coupled with spatio-temporal attention for interpretability. It was tested on simulated stunt-actor and elderly datasets.

Result: BioST-GCN achieved an 89.0% F1-score under full supervision in simulated settings but faced a considerable generalization drop (35.9%) for unseen subjects.

Conclusion: To tackle performance drops caused by biases in simulated data and individual kinematic uniqueness, personalization strategies and privacy-preserving data pipelines are recommended for real-world validation.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve surface reconstruction and view synthesis under sparse input views using improved alignment and multi-view geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overfitting and reconstruction challenges in sparse-view scenarios caused by existing methods using flattened Gaussian primitives.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment to simultaneously enhance geometry and rendering quality, along with Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency to enforce multi-view geometric consistency.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets (DTU, BlendedMVS, Mip-NeRF360), demonstrating superior surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates overfitting, providing more detailed surfaces and high-quality view synthesis in sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLAM-AGS, a framework tackling unreliable instance-labels and low witness rates in computational cytology through multitask pretraining and gradient stabilization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level labeling in computational cytology is costly and unreliable, and witness rates are very low, posing major challenges in accurate data utilization.

Method: SLAM-AGS employs a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework using weakly supervised and self-supervised objectives, stabilized by Adaptive Gradient Surgery, and integrates an attention-based aggregator for predictions and retrieval.

Result: The proposed SLAM-AGS framework achieves better performance in bag-level prediction and positive cell retrieval on a bone-marrow cytology dataset, especially at low witness rates.

Conclusion: Resolving gradient interference provides stable pretraining and enhances downstream task performance, facilitating advancements in computational cytology. The framework is openly shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RepAir, a three-stage framework integrating nnU-Net-based segmentation and topology correction for accurate 3D airway segmentation from CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for airway segmentation is impractical, and automated methods often generate disconnected components that impede reliable lung biomarker extraction.

Method: RepAir combines nnU-Net-based segmentation with a skeleton algorithm for identifying discontinuities and a 1D convolutional classifier to confirm valid anatomical branch reconnections.

Result: RepAir outperforms existing methods like Bronchinet and NaviAirway on voxel-level, topological accuracy, and anatomical consistency across both healthy and pathological lung datasets.

Conclusion: RepAir effectively addresses the challenge of airway segmentation by providing anatomically consistent and accurate results, enhancing its utility in quantitative lung analysis.

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple method for artery-vein segmentation in Doppler holograms using U-Net architectures enhanced with temporal features from pulse analysis, achieving performance comparable to complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional spatial-only retinal segmentation methods, particularly in utilizing the temporal richness of Doppler holographic data.

Method: The proposed method integrates temporal dynamics into standard segmentation frameworks like U-Net using features derived from pulse analysis, allowing effective exploitation of temporal holographic information.

Result: Enhanced segmentation performance is achieved efficiently, comparable to complex attention-based or iterative segmentation models.

Conclusion: Integrating time-resolved preprocessing into deep learning models enhances segmentation in Doppler holography, offering better tools for retinal hemodynamics analysis.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

TL;DR: Image resolution significantly impacts age estimation accuracy; the optimal resolution is 224x224 pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how input image resolution affects the performance of age estimation systems (DeepFace and InsightFace).

Method: Used 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset, downsampled to seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 samples. Measured performance with Mean Absolute Error, Standard Deviation, and Median Absolute Error.

Result: Optimal resolution for accuracy is 224x224 pixels for both frameworks, with DeepFace's MAE at 10.83 years and InsightFace's at 7.46 years. InsightFace consistently performed faster.

Conclusion: Input image resolution has a consistent impact on age estimation accuracy; extreme resolutions, either low or high, reduce accuracy. InsightFace showed better overall performance.

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyMAD, a deep neural network framework designed to improve detection and classification of simultaneous seismic events for border surveillance. The method effectively distinguishes overlapping activities like human, animal, and vehicle movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work comes from the challenge of accurately detecting and distinguishing overlapping activities with seismic sensors, which are critical for reliable border surveillance and monitoring systems.

Method: The method involves HyMAD architecture that integrates spectral features via SincNet and temporal dependencies using an RNN. Self-attention layers and a cross-modal fusion module improve intra-modal representation and multi-label classification.

Result: HyMAD demonstrated strong performance on real-world field recordings, accurately identifying complex and simultaneous events in border surveillance scenarios.

Conclusion: HyMAD provides a modular and effective framework for enhancing seismic-based activity recognition in security applications, enabling better handling of overlapping seismic signals.

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal framework for myocardial scar segmentation in LGE cardiac MRI using ECG-derived data and anatomical priors, significantly improving performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in myocardial scar segmentation due to image contrast variability and artifacts by leveraging complementary ECG physiological data.

Method: A multimodal framework is developed, integrating ECG-based electrophysiological information, anatomical priors via AHA-17 atlas, and a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism to handle time-difference in data acquisition.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art nnU-Net, with significant improvements in dice score (from 0.6149 to 0.8463), precision (0.9115), and sensitivity (0.9043).

Conclusion: Integrating physiological and anatomical insights advances robust and physiologically informed cardiac scar segmentation, setting a new research direction.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

*Yunfeng Wu,Jiayi Song,Zhenxiong Tan,Zihao He,Songhua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel training-free method for generating ultra-high-resolution videos using pretrained video Diffusion Transformers, addressing the limitations of quadratic time and memory complexity in attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the prohibitive cost of training Transformer-based models for ultra-high-resolution videos while maintaining visual fidelity and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method uses an inward sliding window attention mechanism with a dual-path pipeline and cross-attention caching to preserve scalability, reduce redundancy, and ensure global coherence in synthesized videos.

Result: The method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained details and shows superior performance on VBench compared to training-based approaches, while being more efficient.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient, training-free way to generate consistent, high-fidelity ultra-resolution videos, combining scalability and competitive performance.

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

### [211] [Diffusion As Self-Distillation: End-to-End Latent Diffusion In One Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14716)
*Xiyuan Wang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative method, Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), that unifies encoder, decoder, and diffusion processes into a single, trainable network for latent diffusion models, addressing latent collapse issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard latent diffusion models have complex, multi-stage architectures with inefficiencies and incompatibilities with single-network vision frameworks. The motivation is to create a streamlined, unified architecture.

Method: The authors draw parallels between diffusion and self-distillation to identify instability issues in naive network designs. They introduce DSD, modifying training objectives to stabilize latent space and avoid 'latent collapse.'

Result: DSD facilitates stable end-to-end training of a unified network, achieving state-of-the-art results for the ImageNet conditional generation task, with FID scores of 13.44/6.38/4.25 using 42M/118M/205M parameters after 50 epochs.

Conclusion: The DSD framework successfully unifies previously separate components, enhancing computational efficiency and model performance, and opens pathways for further simplicity in latent diffusion architectures.

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot framework to enhance synthetic video realism using a diffusion video foundational model, ensuring structural and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve synthetic video realism for applications requiring photorealistic visuals, while maintaining structural and temporal consistency.

Method: A zero-shot framework using diffusion models without fine-tuning, conditioned on structure-aware information (e.g., depth maps, semantic maps, edge maps) from an auxiliary model.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines in structural integrity and achieves high photorealistic quality in enhanced synthetic videos.

Conclusion: This novel method is simple, general, and effectively enhances synthetic video realism, demonstrating both structural consistency and photorealism in experiments.

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in extracting insights from complex 3D urban datasets due to computational bottlenecks and occlusion, which hinder large-scale exploration and urban analysis.

Method: The paper introduces a neural field-based representation of 3D environments that supports fast direct and inverse queries for tasks like visibility assessments and occlusion management.

Result: The proposed approach effectively identifies desirable viewpoints, evaluates building facade visibility, and analyzes outdoor spaces. Validation includes real-world case studies and expert feedback.

Conclusion: The approach improves urban analysis workflows by efficiently addressing visibility and occlusion challenges in 3D environments, and the publicly available code enhances accessibility and usability.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engagement recognition in videos faces challenges from subjective, noisy labels, hindering model performance in classification tasks.

Method: The framework employs VLMs for annotation refinement and combines it with curriculum learning to process data categorized into high- and low-reliability subsets while softening labels to accommodate uncertainty.

Result: The proposed method enhances classical computer vision models' performance, surpassing prior benchmarks like EngageNet (+1.21%) and DREAMS/PAFE (F1 gains of +0.22/+0.06).

Conclusion: Refining subjective and noisy labels using VLMs and a curriculum-based learning approach significantly boosts engagement recognition, setting a new standard against previous benchmarks.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vision ARC (VARC), a vision-centric approach to abstract reasoning within the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for methods trained from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the lack of a vision-centered approach in solving the visual and abstract reasoning tasks of the ARC dataset, which has primarily been tackled using language-oriented methods.

Method: ARC tasks are reformulated as an image-to-image translation problem, leveraging visual priors by representing inputs on a canvas. A Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture is trained from scratch on ARC data and generalized to unseen tasks through test-time training.

Result: VARC achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, surpassing other methods trained from scratch, and its performance rivals leading large language models while approaching human-level accuracy.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the effectiveness of a vision-driven framework for abstract reasoning tasks, bridging the gap between vision and language-based approaches and significantly improving performance on the ARC dataset.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

TL;DR: TT-Edge improves Tensor Train Decomposition performance on edge AI processors by 1.7x speedup and 40.2% energy reduction, with minimal hardware overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient model compression on resource-constrained edge devices due to growing demands in distributed learning.

Method: TT-Edge employs hardware-software co-design, splits Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations, and utilizes a specialized TTD Engine tightly integrated with a GEMM accelerator.

Result: TT-Edge accelerates ResNet-32 compression by 1.7x and reduces energy consumption by 40.2%, with only a 4% power increase and minimal hardware addition.

Conclusion: TT-Edge effectively mitigates latency and energy inefficiencies of TTD-based compression in edge AI contexts, proven through varying experimental setups.

Abstract: The growing demands of distributed learning on resource constrained edge devices underscore the importance of efficient on device model compression. Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offers high compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss, yet repeated singular value decompositions (SVDs) and matrix multiplications can impose significant latency and energy costs on low power processors. In this work, we present TT-Edge, a hardware software co designed framework aimed at overcoming these challenges. By splitting SVD into two phases--bidiagonalization and diagonalization--TT-Edge offloads the most compute intensive tasks to a specialized TTD Engine. This engine integrates tightly with an existing GEMM accelerator, thereby curtailing the frequent matrix vector transfers that often undermine system performance and energy efficiency. Implemented on a RISC-V-based edge AI processor, TT-Edge achieves a 1.7x speedup compared to a GEMM only baseline when compressing a ResNet 32 model via TTD, while reducing overall energy usage by 40.2 percent. These gains come with only a 4 percent increase in total power and minimal hardware overhead, enabled by a lightweight design that reuses GEMM resources and employs a shared floating point unit. Our experimental results on both FPGA prototypes and post-synthesis power analysis at 45 nm demonstrate that TT-Edge effectively addresses the latency and energy bottlenecks of TTD based compression in edge environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the technical complexity and cost of compiler frameworks crucial for executing and optimizing SIMT on open GPU ISAs.

Method: The VOLT toolchain establishes a hierarchical design incorporating key SIMT-related compiler analyses in the middle-end, facilitating optimization and extensibility.

Result: VOLT supports SIMT code generation across multiple abstraction levels and demonstrates extensibility through case studies on ISA extensions and runtime API.

Conclusion: VOLT provides a robust, extensible compiler framework for open GPU architectures, enabling performance optimization and adaptability to future GPU variants.

Abstract: Recent efforts in open-source GPU research are opening new avenues in a domain that has long been tightly coupled with a few commercial vendors. Emerging open GPU architectures define SIMT functionality through their own ISAs, but executing existing GPU programs and optimizing performance on these ISAs relies on a compiler framework that is technically complex and often undercounted in open hardware development costs.
  To address this challenge, the Vortex-Optimized Lightweight Toolchain (VOLT) has been proposed. This paper presents its design principles, overall structure, and the key compiler transformations required to support SIMT execution on Vortex. VOLT enables SIMT code generation and optimization across multiple levels of abstraction through a hierarchical design that accommodates diverse front-end languages and open GPU hardware. To ensure extensibility as GPU architectures evolve, VOLT centralizes fundamental SIMT-related analyses and optimizations in the middle-end, allowing them to be reused across front-ends and easily adapted to emerging open-GPU variants. Through two case studies on ISA extensions and host-runtime API, this paper also demonstrates how VOLT can support extensions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations and unrealistic assumptions in previous implementations of the GCS algorithm and improve practical applicability.

Method: Replaced the one-way measurement paradigm with a two-way approach and formally modeled frequency sources. Refined error analysis and adjusted link length requirements.

Result: Achieved reduced estimation errors, lowered uncertainty contributions, and established superior skew bounds, improving algorithm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The advancements provide a realistic, efficient model for GCS, enhancing practical deployment and performance while removing prior constraints.

Abstract: This master thesis extends the formal model of the GCS algorithm as presented by (Fan and Lynch 2004, 325), (Lenzen, Locher and Wattenhofer 2008, 510) and (Függer et al. 2023) to operate under implementation-near assumptions by replacing the one-way measurement paradigm assumed in prior work by the two-way measurement paradigm. With this change of paradigm, we remove many restrictions previously enforced to allow provable performance. Most notability, while maintaining the core behaviour of GCS, we: 1. Lift the requirement for unitary link lengths and thereby create a realistic model for flexible deployment of implementations of GCS in practice. 2. Provide a formal model of frequency sources assumed in prior work. 3. Perform a fine grained distinction between the different components of the algorithm's estimation error and globally reduce its impact by multiple orders of magnitude. 4. Significantly reduce the contribution of the uncertainty to the algorithm's estimation error to be in the range of 10\% to 0,1\% of the delay per link instead of being in the oder of the delay per link as in prior work and show matching upper bounds on the local and global skew of GCS.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service platform enhancing serverless AI performance by dynamically adjusting hardware allocation based on workload and service-level objectives (SLOs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current serverless computing platforms struggle with efficient hardware acceleration for AI workloads in heterogeneous environments, failing to meet performance and cost objectives due to static or suboptimal configurations.

Method: The proposed solution, Gaia, includes two components: an Execution Mode Identifier that examines function code for execution mode selection at deployment, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously adapts user SLO-based hardware allocation between CPU and GPU.

Result: Gaia achieved significant performance gains, reducing latency by up to 95%, proving its efficiency in selecting the optimal resources dynamically for varying workloads.

Conclusion: Gaia's architecture demonstrates effective, cost-efficient, and SLO-aware management of hardware acceleration, making it highly suitable for serverless AI computing in diverse environments.

Abstract: Serverless computing offers elastic scaling and pay-per-use execution, making it well-suited for AI workloads. As these workloads run in heterogeneous environments such as the Edge-Cloud-Space 3D Continuum, they often require intensive parallel computation, which GPUs can perform far more efficiently than CPUs. However, current platforms struggle to manage hardware acceleration effectively, as static user-device assignments fail to ensure SLO compliance under varying loads or placements, and one-time dynamic selections often lead to suboptimal or cost-inefficient configurations. To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends. Our evaluation shows that it seamlessly selects the best hardware acceleration for the workload, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 95%. These results indicate that Gaia enables SLO-aware, cost-efficient acceleration for serverless AI across heterogeneous environments.

### [221] [What happens when nanochat meets DiLoCo?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13761)
*Alexander Acker,Soeren Becker,Sasho Nedelkoski,Dominik Scheinert,Odej Kao,Philipp Wiesner*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores trade-offs of communication-constrained training in distributed environments using the DiLoCo algorithm and nanochat project as baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding effects of communication constraints during distributed training of large language models (LLMs).

Method: Introduced DiLoCo algorithm using multiple local steps before synchronization compared with standard data-parallel setups in the nanochat framework.

Result: DiLoCo achieves stable convergence in pretraining but exhibits irreversible representation drift, leading to lower MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores downstream.

Conclusion: Communication-constrained training with DiLoCo affects downstream task performance due to asynchronous updates, with irrecoverable representation drift impacting later training stages.

Abstract: Although LLM training is typically centralized with high-bandwidth interconnects and large compute budgets, emerging methods target communication-constrained training in distributed environments. The model trade-offs introduced by this shift remain underexplored, and our goal is to study them.
  We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline.
  DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.

*Angelika Schwarz,Anton Anders,Cole Brower,Harun Bayraktar,John Gunnels,Kate Clark,RuQing G. Xu,Samuel Rodriguez,Sebastien Cayrols,Paweł Tabaszewski,Victor Podlozhnyuk*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), which enables emulated double-precision (FP64) matrix multiplication on low-precision GPUs efficiently and reliably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the hardware shift in GPUs towards low-precision formats which necessitates algorithms to emulate double-precision accuracy for scientific workloads.

Method: The method involves introducing Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), featuring a hardware-agnostic estimator ESC for decomposition parameters, unsigned integer slicing, and system integration for reliability and efficiency.

Result: ADP achieves FP64 fidelity while maintaining less than 10% overhead and delivers significant speedups (up to 13.2x) over native FP64 GEMM on specific GPUs.

Conclusion: ADP establishes low-precision accelerators as viable for high-fidelity and high-performance scientific computing, meeting accuracy and efficiency demands.

Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has made low-precision formats such as FP16, FP8, and, most recently, block-scaled FP4 the primary focus of modern GPUs, where Tensor Cores now deliver orders-of-magnitude higher throughput than traditional FP64 pipelines. This hardware shift has sparked a new line of algorithm research: using low-precision units to emulate double-precision accuracy through schemes such as Ozaki decompositions. We advance this direction with Automatic Dynamic Precision (ADP), a fully GPU-resident framework that makes emulated FP64 matrix multiplication both efficient and reliable. At its core is the Exponent Span Capacity (ESC), a hardware-agnostic estimator that conservatively determines the decomposition parameter (also known as slices) required to achieve FP64-level accuracy. Built on ESC, ADP integrates exception handling, run time heuristics, and seamless fallback to native FP64, ensuring correctness without host-device synchronization or user intervention. Additionally, we further improve Ozaki-style decompositions with an unsigned integer slicing scheme, which increases representational efficiency and reduces computational waste. Validated against recently proposed BLAS grading tests, ADP consistently preserves FP64 fidelity on challenging inputs while incurring less than 10% run time overhead. In a 55-bit mantissa setting, our approach achieves up to 2.3x and 13.2x speedups over native FP64 GEMM on NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 and the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, respectively. Our results demonstrate that low-precision accelerators can serve as a practical, production-ready foundation for high-fidelity and high-performance scientific computing workloads.

### [223] [Semantic Multiplexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13779)
*Mohammad Abdi,Francesca Meneghello,Francesco Restuccia*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Semantic Multiplexing," a method for multiplexing multiple tasks simultaneously at the semantic layer, enabling efficient parallel execution of tasks beyond physical channel limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing communication systems limit the number of tasks that can be executed in parallel by only multiplexing at the bit level. This bottleneck restricts task handling efficiency for mobile devices requiring numerous concurrent operations.

Method: Semantic Multiplexing merges compressed task-related representations into a unified semantic representation, moving parallel processing from the bit level to the semantic layer. This was tested experimentally using Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios.

Result: Experimental results show that Semantic Multiplexing maintains task accuracy while multiplexing more tasks than physical channel limits. It significantly improves latency, energy consumption, and communication load compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Semantic Multiplexing is a promising approach for enhancing task processing efficiency at the wireless edge. It offers better performance and resource utilization without contradicting established capacity principles.

Abstract: Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\times$, 25$\times$, and 54$\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.

### [224] [Do MPI Derived Datatypes Actually Help? A Single-Node Cross-Implementation Study on Shared-Memory Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13804)
*Temitayo Adefemi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates MPI Derived Datatypes (DDTs) performance across four MPI implementations using three 2D applications. Results show no universally superior approach, necessitating performance profiling for specific stacks and modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the practicality and performance portability of MPI Derived Datatypes (DDTs) compared to manual packing/unpacking of non-contiguous data across multiple MPI stacks.

Method: Three 2D applications were implemented in both manual packing (BASIC) and DDT versions. Identical communication semantics were tested across implementations (MPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI, MVAPICH2) under strong and weak scaling on a single node.

Result: Mixed results highlight the inconsistency in DDT performance across different MPI stacks and applications. No single approach consistently outperformed the other across all tested conditions.

Conclusion: Profiling DDT-based and manual-packing designs is recommended for specific MPI implementations and communication modes due to the lack of guaranteed performance portability for DDTs.

Abstract: MPI's derived datatypes (DDTs) promise easier, copy-free communication of non-contiguous data, yet their practical performance remains debated and is often reported only for a single MPI stack. We present a cross-implementation assessment using three 2D applications: a Jacobi CFD solver, Conway's Game of Life, and a lattice-based image reconstruction. Each application is written in two ways: (i) a BASIC version with manual packing and unpacking of non-contiguous regions and (ii) a DDT version using MPI_Type_vector and MPI_Type_create_subarray with correct true extent via MPI_Type_create_resized. For API parity, we benchmark identical communication semantics: non-blocking point-to-point (Irecv/Isend + Waitall), neighborhood collectives (MPI_Neighbor_alltoallw), and MPI-4 persistent operations (*_init). We run strong and weak scaling on 1-4 ranks, validate bitwise-identical halos, and evaluate four widely used MPI implementations: MPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI, and MVAPICH2 on a single ARCHER2 node. Results are mixed. DDTs can be fastest, for example for the image reconstruction code on Intel MPI and MPICH, but can also be among the slowest on other stacks, such as Open MPI and MVAPICH2 for the same code. For the CFD solver, BASIC variants generally outperform DDTs across semantics, whereas for Game of Life the ranking flips depending on the MPI library. We also observe stack-specific anomalies, for example MPICH slowdowns with DDT neighborhood and persistent modes. Overall, no strategy dominates across programs, semantics, and MPI stacks; performance portability for DDTs is not guaranteed. We therefore recommend profiling both DDT-based and manual-packing designs under the intended MPI implementation and communication mode. Our study is limited to a single node and does not analyze memory overhead; multi-node and GPU-aware paths are left for future work.

TL;DR: Inter-GPU communication bottlenecks modern AI workloads. ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework, simplifies multi-GPU kernel development and optimizes performance across architectures using core principles and templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in inter-GPU communication in modern AI workloads, which hinder theoretical peak performance despite hardware advancements.

Method: ParallelKittens (PK) extends ThunderKittens framework by providing eight core primitives and a unified programming template for multi-GPU design, validated on Hopper and Blackwell architectures.

Result: PK demonstrates significant performance improvements with up to 2.33x speedup for data/tensor-parallel workloads and up to 4.08x for sequence-parallel workloads.

Conclusion: ParallelKittens successfully simplifies multi-GPU kernel design while offering substantial speedups, making it pivotal for efficient inter-GPU communication in heterogeneous AI workloads.

Abstract: Inter-GPU communication has become a major bottleneck for modern AI workloads as models scale and improvements in hardware compute throughput outpace improvements in interconnect bandwidth. Existing systems mitigate this through compute-communication overlap but often fail to meet theoretical peak performance across heterogeneous workloads and new accelerators. Instead of operator-specific techniques, we ask whether a small set of simple, reusable principles can systematically guide the design of optimal multi-GPU kernels. We present ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework that drastically simplifies the development of overlapped multi-GPU kernels. PK extends the ThunderKittens framework and embodies the principles of multi-GPU kernel design through eight core primitives and a unified programming template, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the factors that govern multi-GPU performance$\unicode{x2014}$data-transfer mechanisms, resource scheduling, and design overheads. We validate PK on both Hopper and Blackwell architectures. With fewer than 50 lines of device code, PK achieves up to $2.33 \times$ speedup for data- and tensor-parallel workloads, $4.08 \times$ for sequence-parallel workloads, and $1.22 \times$ for expert-parallel workloads.

*Ziyi Xu,Zhiqiang Xie,Swapnil Gandhi,Christos Kozyrakis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FailSafe is a robust fault-tolerant tensor parallelism system designed for efficient inference of large language models across unreliable GPU setups, overcoming issues like GPU failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor parallelism frameworks tightly couple GPUs, making them vulnerable to GPU failures, expensive recomputations, and resource imbalances.

Method: FailSafe introduces Cyclic KVCache Placement, Hybrid Attention, Fine-Grained Load-Aware Routing, KVCache backup, and on-demand weight recovery to enhance fault-tolerance and system performance.

Result: In testing on an 8xH100 DGX system, FailSafe outperformed traditional fault handling techniques, achieving up to 2x higher throughput and significantly faster recovery times, maintaining high throughput even with multiple GPU failures.

Conclusion: FailSafe ensures robust and efficient LLM inference by addressing GPU failures and resource imbalances, proving to be a lightweight and high-performing solution for dynamic hardware conditions.

Abstract: Tensor parallelism (TP) enables large language models (LLMs) to scale inference efficiently across multiple GPUs, but its tight coupling makes systems fragile: a single GPU failure can halt execution, trigger costly KVCache recomputation, and introduce long-term compute and memory imbalance. We present FailSafe, a fault-tolerant TP serving system that sustains high performance under irregular GPU availability. FailSafe introduces three techniques to balance computation and memory across GPUs: (1) Cyclic KVCache Placement for uniform memory utilization, (2) Hybrid Attention combining tensor- and data-parallel attention to eliminate stragglers, and (3) Fine-Grained Load-Aware Routing to dynamically balance requests. It further employs proactive KVCache backup and on-demand weight recovery to avoid expensive recomputation and redundant data transfers. We implement these techniques in a lightweight serving engine compatible with existing LLM infrastructures. Evaluated on an 8xH100 DGX system with real-world fault traces and representative workloads, FailSafe achieves up to 2x higher throughput and two orders of magnitude lower recovery latency compared to standard fault handling approaches. Even with up to three GPU failures, FailSafe sustains high throughput and balanced utilization, demonstrating robust and efficient LLM serving under dynamic and unreliable hardware conditions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 10Cache, a tensor caching and migration system for efficient training of large language models (LLMs) in cloud environments. It reduces reliance on expensive GPUs by optimizing memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for training LLMs in the cloud is hindered by GPU memory limitations and high costs, despite offloading to CPU and NVMe. Current methods face inefficiencies like high tensor migration latency and poor memory utilization, leading to increased costs and training time.

Method: 10Cache leverages profiling to prefetch tensors efficiently, allocates pinned memory buffers based on tensor size, and enables memory buffer reuse. It coordinates memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe storage tiers to optimize memory efficiency.

Result: 10Cache achieves up to 2x training speedup, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases memory utilization on CPU and GPU by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 10Cache is an effective and scalable memory management solution for LLM training in the cloud, significantly optimizing throughput and reducing reliance on expensive resources like high-end GPUs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) in the cloud faces growing memory bottlenecks due to the limited capacity and high cost of GPUs. While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.
  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.

### [228] [Hyperion: Hierarchical Scheduling for Parallel LLM Acceleration in Multi-tier Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14450)
*Mulei Ma,Minrui Xu,Zihan Chen,Yang Yang,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed across multi-tier networks require optimized model partitioning and scheduling. This paper introduces Hyperion, a two-stage framework addressing these challenges to minimize latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient execution of LLMs across edge, fog, and cloud tiers faces challenges like limited resources, requiring solutions for model partitioning and task scheduling to reduce latency.

Method: The proposed Hyperion framework uses a hierarchical two-stage approach: Stage 1 is offline inter-tier model partitioning using Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP), and Stage 2 is online intra-tier task scheduling with the Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm.

Result: Hyperion achieves up to 52.1% and 31.2% lower latency compared to GPipe and HEFT baselines, demonstrating superior scalability and improved GPU utilization in multi-tier inference tasks.

Conclusion: Hyperion offers a practical and efficient solution for reducing end-to-end latency in LLM inference pipelines, proving its capability to balance compute and memory across multi-tier networks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly executed across edge, fog, and cloud tiers where limited GPU memory, heterogeneous compute, and variable inter-tier bandwidth jointly constrain deployment and motivate model partitioning and request scheduling. In this setting, achieving low end-to-end latency is governed not only by where a model is deployed (inter-tier model partitioning) but also by how incoming requests are scheduled (intra-tier task scheduling) across heterogeneous nodes. These two problems are tightly coupled, as a suboptimal scheduler can negate the benefits of a good partition, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose Hyperion, a hierarchical two-stage framework that jointly optimizes partitioning and scheduling to minimize end-to-end latency for pipelined LLM inference in multi-tier networks, balancing compute and memory across tiers while introducing negligible runtime overhead and requiring no model retraining. Motivated by the observation that partition choices evolve on slower timescales than request arrivals, Stage 1 performs offline, inter-tier partitioning via a Binary Search with Dynamic Programming (BSDP) procedure to produce balanced stage times under tier capacity and memory constraints; to adapt to time-varying load, Stage 2 performs online, intra-tier scheduling with a lightweight Adaptive Real-time Task Scheduling (ARTS) algorithm that maps each request to the best available node using real-time estimates of queue length and effective capacity. Experimental results on multi-tier inference tasks demonstrate that Hyperion significantly reduces end-to-end latency by up to 52.1\% and 31.2\%, with the Phi-3-medium model, compared to the GPipe and HEFT baselines, respectively. Furthermore, Hyperion shows superior scalability in long-sequence generation, maintaining a 44.5\% lower latency than GPipe and achieving higher GPU utilization.

*Fabian Stricker,David Bermbach,Christian Zirpins*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of participant failures on model quality in inter-organizational cross-silo federated learning (FL) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-silo federated learning is critical for organizations to collaborate without sharing data; however, its reliability faces challenges due to participant failures.

Method: The paper studies the impact of participant failures, analyzing timing, data skew, and evaluation methods on model quality in cross-silo FL systems.

Result: The evaluation can misrepresent the impact due to data skews, and the timing of failures significantly affects the model quality.

Conclusion: Insights provided can guide researchers and software architects in designing robust federated learning systems for inter-organizational collaboration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm for training machine learning (ML) models without sharing data. While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.
  Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL systems for LLMs suffer from inefficiencies, notably during the rollout phase, due to workload imbalance, long-tail latency, and poor resource utilization. This limits the speed and performance of modern RL models.

Method: Introduced 'Seer,' an online context-learning system with three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding.

Result: Seer improves rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93%, significantly enhancing RL training iterations when evaluated on production-grade RL workloads.

Conclusion: Seer addresses inherent inefficiencies in traditional RL systems, accelerating the training process for LLMs and ensuring more efficient resource utilization and reduced latency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become critical for advancing modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing synchronous RL systems face severe performance bottlenecks. The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome resource limitations in classical simulations of quantum algorithms and improve multi-GPU scalability.

Method: The paper integrates MPI into QED-C benchmarks to evaluate multi-GPU communication performance across various systems and interconnect technologies.

Result: Benchmarks demonstrate substantial speed improvements: up to 16X performance gains from interconnect advancements and 4.5X improvements from GPU architecture.

Conclusion: Efficient multi-GPU communication is critical for quantum simulations, and interconnect technology has a bigger impact on overall performance compared to GPU architectural advances.

Abstract: As is intrinsic to the fundamental goal of quantum computing, classical simulation of quantum algorithms is notoriously demanding in resource requirements. Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential scaling inherent in classical methods, multi-GPU simulation can be required to achieve representative system sizes. In this case, inter-GPU communications can bottleneck performance. In this work, we present the introduction of MPI into the QED-C Application-Oriented Benchmarks to facilitate benchmarking on HPC systems. We review the advances in interconnect technology and the APIs for multi-GPU communication. We benchmark using a variety of interconnect paths, including the recent NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 architecture that represents the first product to expand high-bandwidth GPU-specialized interconnects across multiple nodes. We show that while improvements to GPU architecture have led to speedups of over 4.5X across the last few generations of GPUs, advances in interconnect performance have had a larger impact with over 16X performance improvements in time to solution for multi-GPU simulations.

*Saif Ur Rehman,Wajid Yousuf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes XPINN, an enhanced PINN framework, to improve the simulation of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs in computational science, specifically for two-phase flow in porous media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with effectively solving steep gradients, discontinuities, and nonlinear wave interactions in hyperbolic PDEs, which are crucial in modeling physical phenomena like multiphase flow.

Method: The XPINN framework decomposes the domain into dynamic regions (pre-shock/post-shock) using localized subnetworks, coupled via Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, to better capture discontinuities and wave dynamics.

Result: XPINN accurately captures complex nonlinear wave interactions without artificial corrections, achieving better stability, faster convergence, and higher resolution than traditional PINNs.

Conclusion: XPINN is effective and scalable for solving challenging PDEs in multiphase flow systems and can outperform existing PINN methods while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

Result: The generated nanokernels achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art microkernel libraries, supporting both vector and tile-based CPU instructions.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between domain-level operations and processor capabilities, providing an automated and scalable solution to generate high-performance code for ML and AI applications.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

### [235] [Blurred Encoding for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13741)
*Silin Zhou,Yao Chen,Shuo Shang,Lisi Chen,Bingsheng He,Ryosuke Shibasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes BLUE (BLUrred Encoding method), which improves trajectory representation learning by maintaining fine-grained spatial-temporal details through hierarchical patches with multi-level encoding-decoding structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing TRL methods that lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details by grouping GPS points into single grid cells or road segments.

Method: BLUE introduces a hierarchical patch approach, gradually reducing GPS coordinate precision to create multi-level spatial patches. A pyramid encoder-decoder model with Transformer is used for trajectory embedding at each level, trained with trajectory reconstruction using MSE loss.

Result: BLUE was compared against 8 state-of-the-art TRL methods across three tasks and outperformed the best baselines by an average of 30.90% in accuracy.

Conclusion: The hierarchical patch approach in BLUE effectively combines fine-grained spatial details with high-level travel patterns, leading to significant improvements in TRL tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

*Joey Velez-Ginorio,Nada Amin,Konrad Kording,Steve Zdancewic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cajal, a programming language to directly program neural networks, overcoming the limitations of gradient-based learning in handling discrete algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network design relies heavily on gradient-based learning, which struggles with discrete algorithms due to non-differentiability, limiting neural network capabilities.

Method: The paper presents Cajal, a typed and linear programming language that compiles discrete algorithms into differentiable forms compatible with gradient learning.

Result: Cajal enables networks to integrate discrete structures, improving learning speed, data efficiency, and debugging ease, demonstrated through experimental implementations.

Conclusion: Linear programming languages like Cajal provide a promising avenue for directly programming neural networks by combining the strengths of learning and programmable discrete structures.

Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

*Ci Lin,Tet Yeap,Iluju Kiringa,Biwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepDefense, a framework using Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) to reduce adversarial vulnerability in deep neural networks by improving robustness against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which cause incorrect predictions, creating a need for robust defense mechanisms.

Method: DeepDefense uses Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to align input gradients with internal feature representations, smoothing the loss landscape and diminishing susceptibility to adversarial attacks.

Result: DeepDefense achieves improved robustness on CIFAR-10 by surpassing standard adversarial training by 15.2% under APGD and 24.7% under FGSM attacks, as well as demonstrating stronger decision boundaries against optimization-based attacks.

Conclusion: DeepDefense is an effective, architecture-agnostic framework that significantly enhances adversarial robustness in deep learning models, representing a promising defense strategy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

*E. Zhixuan Zeng,Yuhao Chen,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALEX, a framework to analyze biases in image generation models by extracting meaningful latent directions through natural language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing methods for bias analysis in diffusion models, which are constrained by narrow categories or manual interpretation, thus hindering scalability and the discovery of subtle patterns.

Method: SCALEX provides automated bias analysis by extracting semantically meaningful directions from the H-space using natural language prompts, requiring no retraining or manual labelling.

Result: SCALEX effectively identifies gender bias in professional prompts, ranks semantic alignment across descriptors, and discovers conceptual structures without supervision.

Conclusion: SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models scalable, interpretable, and extensible, enhancing the ability to uncover and address biases effectively.

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

*Abdullah Al Shiam,Md. Khademul Islam Molla,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Md. Abdus Samad Kamal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for improved classification accuracy in BCIs by using region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion with EEG signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational complexity in Brain-Computer Interface systems while ensuring accurate capture of relevant brain activity during motor imagery tasks.

Method: Region-based channel selection is combined with three feature extraction techniques (CSP, Fuzzy C-means, and TSM) targeting EEG signals' spatial, cluster, and non-linear characteristics, followed by classification using Support Vector Machine.

Result: Validation on benchmark datasets yielded classification accuracies of 90.77% (dataset IVA) and 84.50% (dataset I), outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach reduces dimensionality, improves computational efficiency, and achieves superior classification accuracy by specifically targeting brain regions involved in motor imagery tasks.

Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerabilities of LLMs in predicting vehicle trajectories, revealing their susceptibility to minor adversarial perturbations and proposing a differential evolution attack method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unexplored vulnerabilities of large language models in safety-critical vehicular trajectory predictions, ensuring trustworthy implementation as autonomous driving systems advance.

Method: The researchers introduced a one-feature differential evolution attack in a black-box scenario, perturbing single kinematic features of surrounding vehicles' input data to test robustness.

Result: Experiments on the highD dataset highlighted the sensitivity of LLM-based models, where even slight, realistic input disruptions significantly affected prediction reliability.

Conclusion: Findings reveal the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness, emphasizing the need for improved safety measures and robustness-focused designs in LLM-based autonomous systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

### [241] [Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13755)
*Zhe Yang,Wenrui Li,Hongtao Chen,Penghong Wang,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of modality bias in multimodal learning and proposes a method, RedReg, to improve balanced optimization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning methods struggle with dominant modality bias, which causes imbalanced optimization and redundant information accumulation.

Method: Proposes RedReg, inspired by the information bottleneck principle. Key techniques include a redundancy phase monitor, co-information gating mechanism, and gradient projection for balanced refinement.

Result: Experiments show RedReg performs better than existing methods across most scenarios. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RedReg addresses the challenges of multimodal dominance and improves balanced optimization and information refinement, ensuring better task performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for probabilistic forecasting by adapting deep lattice networks (DLNs) to produce implicit and nonparametric cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) without quantile overlap, achieving superior performance in solar irradiance forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic forecasting addresses the limitations of point predictions, effectively handling sudden changes in time series data, and benefits from advancements that allow modeling nonparametric CDFs.

Method: The method adapts DLNs for monotonic constraints in simultaneous quantile regression, using LSTM for embeddings and distributing quantile inputs to sub-lattices for multi-horizon CDF forecasts.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms unconstrained methods and other monotonic neural networks in time series forecasting for solar irradiance data.

Conclusion: This work advances probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by demonstrating the effectiveness of adapted DLNs, aiming to spark further research in these fields.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

This framework reflects the real-world complexities of clinical practice, minimizing reliance on extensive preprocessing and incorporating masked loss techniques for robust and unbiased model evaluation. By providing a standardized and unified platform for model development and comparison, VitalBench enables researchers to focus on architectural innovation while ensuring consistency in data handling. This work lays the foundation for advancing predictive models for intraoperative vital sign forecasting, ensuring that these models are not only accurate but also robust and adaptable across diverse clinical environments.

TL;DR: ChemFixer corrects chemically invalid molecules to valid ones, improving molecular generation models' reliability and potential in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the issue of generating invalid molecules by deep learning models and tackle practical challenges in drug discovery.

Method: ChemFixer uses a transformer architecture, pre-trained with masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs for molecule correction.

Result: ChemFixer increased molecular validity while preserving chemical/biological characteristics, expanded drug candidate diversity, and improved drug-target interaction predictions.

Conclusion: ChemFixer enhances molecular validity, diversifies the chemical space, and demonstrates utility in drug discovery tasks, especially in data-limited settings.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

### [245] [On the Gradient Complexity of Private Optimization with Private Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13999)
*Michael Menart,Aleksandar Nikolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents lower and upper bounds on the time complexity of differentially private convex optimization algorithms, explores runtime penalties caused by differential privacy constraints, and extends insights to gradient quantization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the trade-offs in computational complexity and privacy, specifically investigating how differential privacy impacts the runtime of algorithms for minimizing convex losses.

Method: The authors derive theoretical lower bounds on runtime based on the dimension of the problem, privacy constraints, and information limitations. They validate these bounds through comparisons with existing algorithms and extend their analysis to examine gradient quantization effects.

Result: The paper establishes dimension-dependent runtime penalties for differentially private optimization and provides tight bounds for private algorithms. It further shows that gradient quantization imposes significant limitations on optimization.

Conclusion: The results highlight fundamental computational penalties imposed by differential privacy and provide insights into optimal algorithm design under privacy and information constraints.

Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a self-training framework for offensive content detection using scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, employing collaborative pseudo-labeling with Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the challenges of detecting offensive content on social media, which requires high-quality labeled data that is difficult to obtain due to its scarcity and annotation costs.

Method: The method involves a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, iteratively assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data with the assistance of MA-VLMs. They characterize samples as Agreed-Unknown or Disagreed-Unknown and use a Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss for optimization.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a promising approach to improving offensive content detection in low-resource settings by effectively leveraging unlabeled data with MA-VLMs and PNU loss.

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

Conclusion: SmallML provides a scalable, enterprise-grade machine learning solution for SMEs, effectively bridging the gap in AI democratization and enabling accurate predictions with small datasets.

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

### [249] [Radial Compensation: Stable and Semantically Decoupled Generative Models on Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14056)
*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Radial Compensation (RC), a novel method for generative models on curved manifolds, decouples parameters from manifold curvature for better performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues in generative models on curved manifolds, specifically the stiff Jacobians and inflated gradient variance caused by curvature entanglement in current models.

Method: RC selects a base density in the tangent space that depends solely on geodesic distance, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. A new bExp chart family was derived to balance volume distortion and geodesic error, maintaining both manifold density and Fisher information.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate RC's stabilization of generative models across different applications, improving likelihoods, preventing radius blow-ups, and reducing gradient variance.

Conclusion: The RC-bExp framework is a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds, enhancing scalability and performance.

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

*Jiaxin Qi,Yan Cui,Jianqiang Huang,Gaogang Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the scarcity of studies on incremental learning for tokens by focusing on their application in gene analysis within single-cell transcriptomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the research gap in applying incremental learning frameworks to tokens, especially focusing on genes in large-scale biological datasets.

Method: Adapted existing class incremental learning methods to tackle gene forgetting problems and designed a pipeline for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Result: Extensive experiments confirmed the soundness of the framework design and evaluations, alongside effective adaptation methods.

Conclusion: Established a gene incremental learning benchmark in single-cell transcriptomics, providing a step forward in the domain.

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

*Jessy Xinyi Han,Devavrat Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synthetic Survival Control (SSC), a method to study causality in survival analysis using observational data, focusing on counterfactual hazard trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data, such as censoring, small sample sizes, and non-random treatment adoption.

Method: The paper proposes SSC, which uses a weighted combination of observed trajectories from other units to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories, supported by a low-rank panel framework for causal survival analysis.

Result: The method is validated using a cancer treatment dataset, showing improved survival outcomes and lower hazard trajectories with access to novel treatments.

Conclusion: SSC provides a general and interpretable framework for counterfactual survival inference, applicable across fields such as medicine, economics, and public policy.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

### [252] [PROF: An LLM-based Reward Code Preference Optimization Framework for Offline Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13765)
*Shengjie Sun,Jiafei Lyu,Runze Liu,Mengbei Yan,Bo Liu,Deheng Ye,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes PROF, an approach that uses large language models to create and refine reward function codes from natural language and expert trajectories, surpassing traditional offline imitation learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the oversimplified assumption in offline IL methods that reward depends solely on trajectory similarity to expert demonstrations.

Method: The proposed PROF framework uses large language models to generate executable reward function codes from language and trajectory input, and employs Reward Preference Ranking (RPR) to assess and refine these reward functions without interactions with the environment or RL training.

Result: PROF demonstrates superior or comparable performance compared to strong baselines in various D4RL datasets and domains.

Conclusion: Using LLMs and RPR, PROF automates the creation and refinement of effective reward functions, effectively improving offline imitation learning.

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

*Haiqing Zhu,Tijana Zrnic,Celestine Mendler-Dünner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores individual and collective strategic responses to learning platforms, focusing on how these behaviors affect model predictions and equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the strategic behavior of users interacting with learning platforms and how these interactions affect prediction models and align incentives.

Method: The study formalizes level-$k$ thinking from behavioral economics, analyzes user coordination for collective reasoning, and contrasts selfish versus collective actions while discussing alignment of utilities.

Result: Level-$k$ reasoning accelerates equilibrium convergence but doesn’t benefit individuals long-term; collective reasoning improves alignment between users' and the model's objectives.

Conclusion: Strategic user behavior influences model predictions, with coordination offering potential collective benefits through better alignment of utilities for users and models.

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

*Kaizheng Wang,Fabio Cuzzolin,David Moens,Hans Hallez*

TL;DR: The paper introduces Credal Ensemble Distillation (CED), a method to compress deep ensembles (DEs) into a single model for efficient uncertainty quantification in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational and memory costs of Deep Ensembles (DEs) during inference, which hinder practical deployment.

Method: The authors propose Credal Ensemble Distillation (CED) that compresses DE into a single model, CREDIT, which predicts class-wise probability intervals for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks show CED provides superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to existing baselines, significantly reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

Conclusion: CED effectively preserves uncertainty estimation capabilities of DE while maintaining efficiency and practicality by reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

*Sibgat Ul Islam,Jawad Ibn Ahad,Fuad Rahman,Mohammad Ruhul Amin,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), a method that adjusts KD temperature dynamically to improve KD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods use a fixed temperature, which is suboptimal for training and suffers from teacher-student architectural differences causing mismatch.

Method: The proposed DTS adapts the temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student distributions during KD training.

Result: DTS consistently outperforms static-temperature baselines across diverse vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (e.g., GLUE).

Conclusion: DTS enhances KD by dynamically optimizing temperature scheduling, providing better integration with KD frameworks, and improving performance on various tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Sibgat-Ul/DTS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoE-SpeQ, a system employing speculative execution and expert offloading to overcome I/O bottlenecks in Mixture-of-Experts models, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference for Mixture-of-Experts models is heavily constrained by memory requirements and I/O bottlenecks during expert offloading.

Method: MoE-SpeQ uses on-device computation with a draft model to predict future expert requirements and overlaps I/O operations with computation using speculative execution.

Result: MoE-SpeQ achieves up to 2.34x speedup in inference performance compared to existing offloading frameworks.

Conclusion: MoE-SpeQ provides a more accessible solution for Mixture-of-Experts inference on limited hardware, addressing critical performance bottlenecks effectively.

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: The paper mathematically connects self-attention to distributional semantics and explains how core Transformer mechanisms naturally emerge from projection principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the theoretical underpinnings behind self-attention and transformative mechanisms in NLP models like Transformers through mathematical reasoning.

Method: Starts with GloVe embeddings' co-occurrence matrix and defines self-attention as a projection of corpus statistics into sequence context, incorporating elements like query-key-value and positional encoding.

Result: Demonstrates that the Transformer architecture and its components arise naturally from the proposed projection principles, solidifying its design rationale.

Conclusion: Transformer's algebraic form is rooted in mathematical projection principles instead of arbitrary design, advancing the understanding of its structure and functionality.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

*Abolfazl Younesi,Leon Kiss,Zahra Najafabadi Samani,Juan Aznar Poveda,Thomas Fahringer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLARE is an adaptive framework for federated learning that uses reputation-based evaluation to defend against malicious clients, outperforming existing methods in robustness and accuracy under multiple attack types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in federated learning caused by malicious clients and improve adaptability in real-world deployments.

Method: Introduces a multi-dimensional reputation score, adaptive thresholds, reputation-weighted aggregation, and local differential privacy to assess client reliability and protect against advanced adversarial attacks.

Result: Experiments with 100 clients on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN show that FLARE improves robustness by up to 16%, maintains model convergence within 30% of non-attacked baselines, and effectively detects malicious clients.

Conclusion: FLARE enhances federated learning security by adapting to evolving adversarial behaviors while preserving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

TL;DR: This paper studies the transferability of self-supervised learning (SSL), introducing a Task Conflict Calibration technique to improve it through task-level information and a bi-level optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and improve the representation transferability of SSL, addressing task conflicts that hinder effective transfer.

Method: They develop the Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method, involving SSL task splitting, causal generative factor extraction, weight assignment, and calibration via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework.

Result: Their experiments on multiple downstream tasks show that TC$^2$ consistently enhances SSL model transferability.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of SSL task-level information coupled with calibration techniques can boost transferability, addressing task conflicts effectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

*Samuel Nathanson,Rebecca Williams,Cynthia Matuszek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores whether larger language models (LLMs) can systematically force smaller ones into harmful or restricted behavior, revealing a correlation between adversarial power and model size ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how vulnerabilities scale when language models interact adversarially, particularly in safety-critical multi-agent environments.

Method: Using 6,000 multi-turn interactions across varied LLM scales (0.6B-120B parameters) and standardized adversarial tasks (JailbreakBench), the study evaluates harm and refusal behavior through aggregated scores by independent LLM judges.

Result: Larger attacker models are more likely to elicit harmful responses; the harm correlates strongly with the logarithmic size ratio of attacker-to-target models (r = 0.51, p < 0.001). Attacker diversity rather than target vulnerability drives outcomes. Strong negative correlation exists between harm and attacker refusal.

Conclusion: Size asymmetry between LLMs influences interaction outcomes, where larger models are more adversarially potent. Enhancing attacker alignment can mitigate harm, motivating further research into inter-model safety and alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for integrating explainability directly into the training process of large deep learning models by introducing ScoresActivation, a function enabling feature ranking in an end-to-end differentiable manner. This method outperforms SHAP in speed and yields globally faithful and stable feature importance rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the lack of faithfulness and utility in post hoc explanation methods for deep learning models. They seek to make interpretability an intrinsic part of the model training process.

Method: The paper introduces the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism incorporated directly into the end-to-end learning pipeline. It enables differentiable and scalable integration of global explainability without negatively affecting predictive performance.

Result: Evaluations on benchmark datasets show globally faithful feature rankings aligned with SHAP values, faster feature scoring (150x faster than SHAP), and improved classification accuracy even with irrelevant features.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable and inherently explainable framework for machine learning models.

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAS, a framework to accelerate RL rollouts in LLMs by using historical patterns and a length-aware speculation policy, resulting in time savings without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rollout phase of RL post-training for LLMs is inefficient due to the dominance of long-tail rollout lengths, which increases training time. There is also an overlooked opportunity to utilize stable patterns from historical rollouts.

Method: DAS utilizes an adaptive drafter with an incrementally maintained suffix tree to predict rollout patterns, combined with a length-aware speculation policy that optimally budgets decoding efforts for long trajectories.

Result: Experiments show DAS reduces rollout time by up to 50% on math and code reasoning tasks, while maintaining identical training performances and learning quality.

Conclusion: DAS proves that distribution-aware speculative decoding can accelerate RL post-training significantly without altering model outputs or degrading learning outcomes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

Conclusion: AnaCP eliminates catastrophic forgetting while preserving efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in class-incremental learning.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

### [264] [Tractable Probabilistic Models for Investment Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13888)
*Nicolas M. Cuadrado A.,Mohannad Takrouri,Jiří Němeček,Martin Takáč,Jakub Mareček*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using tractable probabilistic models, like sum-product networks, to improve decade-long energy investment planning by enabling scalable scenario analysis and better uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, generation and transmission planning in power utilities struggle with limitations in classical scenario-based forecasting approaches, which restrict insight into volatility and hinder robust decision-making.

Method: The authors use tractable probabilistic models, particularly sum-product networks, for forecasting energy use. These models allow precise inference of key probabilities and support robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.

Result: The method is demonstrated through a case study in power system planning, showcasing its computational and reliability advantages over traditional models.

Conclusion: Using probabilistic models enhances forecasting, improves scenario analysis, and allows embedding reliability constraints directly into investment planning.

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

*Kai Chen,Chen Gong,Tianhao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MargNet, a neural network-based algorithm for synthesizing differentially private tabular data that outperforms statistical models in densely correlated datasets and achieves high utility with speedup in sparsely correlated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consensus favors statistical models for DP tabular data synthesis, but densely correlated datasets challenge their performance, where neural networks might excel due to their capacity to model complex distributions.

Method: MargNet integrates successful elements of statistical models into a neural network framework. It uses an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains NNs to synthesize data matching selected marginals.

Result: MargNet achieves near-parity utility with statistical methods in sparsely correlated data while providing a 7x speedup. For densely correlated datasets, it sets a new benchmark, reducing fidelity error by up to 26%.

Conclusion: MargNet bridges the gap in performance between statistical models and neural networks in DP data synthesis by leveraging NN capabilities for complex dependencies. This ensures improved utility and efficiency across various correlation densities.

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel renewable energy forecasting model incorporating spatial and temporal weather data. It achieved significant improvements in prediction accuracy for wind and solar energy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve renewable energy forecasting accuracy to support the reduction of fossil fuel dependency and grid decarbonization.

Method: The approach uses weather maps encoded as spatial tokens via a convolutional neural network, processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics over 45 hours.

Result: The model reduces RMSE by approximately 60% for wind energy and 20% for solar energy when compared to ENTSO-E operational forecasts.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial tokens with temporal evolution achieves better energy forecasting accuracy, showcasing significant improvements for wind and solar predictions.

Abstract: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60\% and 20\% for wind and solar respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN) to address limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs, by leveraging complex-weighted diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in GNNs, such as oversmoothing and inefficacy in heterophilic graphs, and enhance their expressive power through a novel graph-based framework.

Method: The paper introduces complex-weighted structures to graphs, enabling a diffusion process in the complex domain. It develops CWCN, which learns these structures and integrates learnable matrices and nonlinear activations.

Result: CWCN achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets while maintaining simplicity and providing a principled approach to enhance GNN expressiveness.

Conclusion: Complex-weighted diffusion offers a robust and general mechanism to improve GNN models, providing both theoretical grounding and practical effectiveness for various graph-based applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of varying the bootstrap rate (BR) in Random Forests (RFs) and establishes its importance as a tunable hyperparameter for optimizing regression performance across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how varying bootstrap rates (BRs) can improve Random Forest regression performance, since the default BR of 1.0 may not be optimal for all datasets.

Method: The authors systematically examined the impact of BR values ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 across 39 diverse regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, using repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error to evaluate performance.

Result: The study found that tuning BR yields significant improvements: the optimal BR varied depending on dataset characteristics, with lower BRs benefiting high local target variance datasets and higher BRs reducing bias in low-noise scenarios.

Conclusion: BR is a critical hyperparameter in Random Forest regressions, and its tuning based on dataset-specific attributes can enhance model accuracy by addressing the bias-variance trade-off effectively.

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training stochastic neural networks for learning multidimensional random field models, including dimensionality issues and limited training data.

Method: Develop and theoretically analyze a Wasserstein-distance approach for training SNNs, improving its robustness and testing it via numerical experiments.

Result: Prove a generalization error bound indicating reduced dependency on dimensionality and demonstrate effective training of SNNs for multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks.

Conclusion: The improved Wasserstein-distance approach effectively mitigates certain dimensionality issues, offering a robust solution for training SNNs on multidimensional random field models.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

*Ashwin Saraswatula,David Klindt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights that PCA Whitening, a preprocessing step, improves Sparse Autoencoders' (SAEs) interpretability and optimization landscape while slightly compromising reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome optimization difficulties in training Sparse Autoencoders caused by correlated input data and to enhance the interpretability of learned features.

Method: The authors propose applying PCA Whitening to the input activations of Sparse Autoencoders, theoretically and empirically analyzing its impact on the optimization and interpretability metrics.

Result: PCA Whitening improved SAE interpretability (e.g., sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement) across models and sparsity regimes, with minor reductions in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Whitening should be a default preprocessing step for SAE training when feature interpretability is prioritized over optimal reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

### [271] [Node-Level Uncertainty Estimation in LLM-Generated SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13984)
*Hilaf Hasson,Ruocheng Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for detecting and addressing errors in SQL queries generated by large language models (LLMs) using detailed node-level uncertainty estimation in their abstract syntax trees (ASTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the reliability and accuracy of SQL generation by LLMs through a more granular diagnostic approach, addressing challenges in alias variation and structural penalization.

Method: The method involves labeling AST nodes using a semantically aware algorithm and designing schema-aware, lexical feature representations for these nodes to train a supervised classifier that predicts error probabilities, interpreted as uncertainty.

Result: The framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, outperforming traditional token log-probability approaches with an AUC increase of +27.44%, and shows robustness across different databases.

Conclusion: Node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation is validated as a more effective, interpretable alternative for diagnosing and repairing LLM-generated SQL queries, enabling expanded utility from repair strategies to selective execution.

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for Bayesian network structure learning using tractable probabilistic circuits, improving marginal inference and overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in inferring the graphical structure of Bayesian networks, particularly the challenges of marginalization in conventional methods.

Method: The method leverages tractable probabilistic circuits trained on both the original distribution and marginal queries, allowing for fast and exact marginalization.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates improved performance of Bayesian structure learning when using the proposed method for marginal inference.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more effective and efficient Bayesian network structure learning by overcoming the limitations of traditional dynamic programming for marginalization.

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

TL;DR: The paper examines the vulnerabilities of probabilistic certification frameworks, introducing a method to create imperceptible adversarial examples that can bypass certified defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and expose the potential risks of certificate spoofing in certified robust machine learning models, addressing limitations in current robustness certification methods.

Method: The authors propose region-focused adversarial examples to generate imperceptible perturbations that manipulate the certification process and bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses.

Result: Demonstrated ability to bypass advanced defenses like Densepure with crafted adversarial examples, even achieving larger certification radii for incorrect target classes.

Conclusion: Robustness certification methods are not foolproof and require further investigation to address vulnerabilities and potential exploitation by adversarial tactics.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

TL;DR: The paper investigates emergent misalignment (EMA) in AI models arising from narrow domain refusal unlearning and proposes mitigation strategies through additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon in AI models, where refusal unlearning for specific domains causes undesired cross-domain generalization.

Method: The authors performed refusal unlearning in the domains of Cybersecurity and Safety and evaluated EMA effects across seven responsible AI domains. They utilized concept vector analyses and proposed cross-entropy loss on retain data as a mitigation strategy.

Result: Refusal unlearning in narrow domains propagates EMA across unrelated domains, especially with larger effects in Safety. The proposed mitigation method, using retain data with a cross-entropy loss function, restores alignment significantly while lowering refusal rates for targeted domains.

Conclusion: Narrow domain refusal unlearning propagates emergent misalignment to unrelated domains, but incorporating retain data with cross-entropy loss offers an effective way to restore AI system alignment.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

Result: The $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with RECAP achieves high performance on tasks such as folding laundry, assembling boxes, and making espresso drinks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rates.

Conclusion: RECAP enhances VLA models for real-world applications by specializing them for high-performance tasks, offering notable gains in efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.

Motivation: Traditional motion analysis systems in precision sports like archery are expensive and intrusive, making them unsuitable for natural training environments.

Method: The paper proposes a wearable device with accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to collect motion and physiological data. It uses machine learning models: LSTM for motion recognition and MLP for stress estimation.

Result: The framework achieved 96.8% accuracy in motion recognition and 80% accuracy in stress estimation.

Conclusion: Integrating motion and physiological data offers valuable insights into technical and mental states of athletes, paving the way for intelligent training feedback systems.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

TL;DR: CafeMed is a new medication recommendation system that combines dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention to improve treatment decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems do not effectively account for the synergistic effects of medical entities or adapt causal relationships based on a patient's specific context.

Method: The framework includes a Causal Weight Generator (CWG) to create dynamic causal weights and a Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) to model interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures.

Result: CafeMed outperforms current methods in accuracy on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets while maintaining lower drug--drug interaction rates.

Conclusion: Dynamic causal reasoning and cross-modal synergies improve the safety and personalization of medication recommendations, validated by superior performance on benchmarks.

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is enhanced with a correction scheme (CFG-EC) to improve generative model outputs by reducing inconsistency between training and sampling noise estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG has inconsistencies between training and sampling processes, negatively affecting generative model outcomes. Improving the alignment can enhance fidelity and quality.

Method: Introduced CFG-EC, a scheme that refines unconditional noise predictions to make them orthogonal to conditional error components, reducing interference during sampling.

Result: CFG-EC delivers better image generation performance, particularly in low guidance sampling scenarios, with improved prompt alignment compared to CFG and CFG++.

Conclusion: CFG-EC effectively enhances conditional generative models by reducing sampling errors, thus achieving more consistent and high-fidelity outputs.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based localization methods lack the capability to adapt to variations in device configurations, such as bandwidth and the number of antennas. This hinders their practical usability.

Method: Meta-SimGNN uses a novel CSI graph construction scheme treating access points as graph nodes, amplitude-phase fusion for consistent CSI features, and similarity-based meta-learning to quickly adapt to new scenarios.

Result: Experimental results on WiFi devices across various scenarios demonstrate that Meta-SimGNN achieves better generalization and accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Meta-SimGNN effectively addresses challenges posed by environment and device variations, improving both localization robustness and practicality.

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

*Iden Kalemaj,Luca Melis,Maxime Boucher,Ilya Mironov,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel observational auditing framework for differential privacy by utilizing data distribution randomness without altering datasets, simplifying the process for large-scale systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy auditing methods are resource-intensive as they require dataset modifications, which are challenging to implement in large-scale systems.

Method: The authors introduce an observational auditing framework that exploits the natural randomness in data distributions, eliminating the need for dataset alterations. The method is extended to audit not only membership inference but also protected attributes, including labels.

Result: Experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in auditing label privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables practical privacy auditing for large-scale production systems while addressing limitations of traditional methods, advancing privacy evaluation in machine learning.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

### [281] [Soft-Label Training Preserves Epistemic Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14117)
*Agamdeep Singh,Ashish Tiwari,Hosein Hasanbeig,Priyanshu Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues for using annotation distributions as ground truth instead of collapsing them into single labels, emphasizing epistemic uncertainty in ambiguous data. Empirical results show improved correlation with human annotations using their proposed method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the epistemic misalignment caused by collapsing diverse human annotations into single labels for subjective tasks. They believe this approach ignores fundamental ambiguities and may lead to overconfident models.

Method: Soft-label training is introduced, where models are trained on annotation distributions as ground truth instead of single aggregated labels.

Result: Soft-label training preserves epistemic uncertainty and improves alignment with human annotations, achieving 32% lower KL divergence and 61% stronger correlation in NLP and vision tasks, while maintaining accuracy comparable to hard-label training.

Conclusion: The paper redefines annotation distributions as accurate representations of uncertainty, proposing that models learn from them rather than treat them as noise.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

### [282] [Fair-GNE : Generalized Nash Equilibrium-Seeking Fairness in Multiagent Healthcare Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14135)
*Promise Ekpo,Saesha Agarwal,Felix Grimm,Lekan Molu,Angelique Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fair-GNE, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach designed to ensure fair workload distribution among agents in healthcare settings by formulating the problem as a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL solutions rely on post hoc adjustments to enforce fairness, which lack runtime reliability and self-enforceable fairness among agents whose actions interdepend.

Method: The authors propose Fair-GNE, a scheme that models MARL problems within a constrained GNE framework and steers group policy towards equilibria where no agent gains by unilaterally altering its decisions. This is tested in a resuscitation simulator.

Result: Fair-GNE shows a significant improvement in workload balance (JFI: 0.89 vs. 0.33, p < 0.01) while sustaining an 86% task success rate, thus outperforming baselines in fairness enforcement and efficiency.

Conclusion: Fair-GNE effectively improves fairness in resource-sharing multi-agent settings, achieving reliable, equitable performance and advancing MARL methodologies tailored for large-scale healthcare systems.

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

*Fatima Kazi,Alex Young,Yash Inani,Setareh Rafatirad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to social biases. This study proposed an automated framework to detect biases like gender and race and improved bias mitigation performance through fine-tuning and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the critical need to ensure fair outputs in generative AI, which can perpetuate stereotypes and misinformation due to biases in training data.

Method: The study evaluated biases using benchmarks (StereoSet, CrowSPairs) and proposed a Bias-Identification Framework. A two-pronged approach assessed both explicit and implicit biases, complemented by Bag-of-Words analysis. Fine-tuning and data augmentation were applied to improve bias mitigation performance.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs struggled with gender biases but excelled in avoiding racial biases. The models often over-relied on keywords. Enhanced LLMs showed improved implicit bias detection with up to 20% performance gains during cross-dataset testing.

Conclusion: Addressing biases in LLMs is essential as they inherit biases from training data. Fine-tuning with data augmentation improved their capacity to detect and mitigate social biases, contributing to fairer AI outcomes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

*Junpeng Zhao,Lin Li,Kaixi Hu,Kaize Shi,Jingling Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), a method specifically designed for Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) to address privacy concerns with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of effective unlearning methods tailored for privacy protection in Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs). Existing methods fail to handle the unique properties of signed graphs and degrade performance.

Method: The approach involves a three-stage process: identifying minimally influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, applying sociological theories for privacy budget allocation, and executing importance-weighted parameter updates for efficient unlearning.

Result: CSGU improves utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness compared to existing methods, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU) offers provable privacy guarantees while maintaining utility and sociological principles underlying signed graphs, outperforming traditional methods in SGNNs.

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

*Zheyu Lin,Jirui Yang,Hengqi Guo,Yubing Bao,Yao Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces N-GLARE, a latent representation-based tool to evaluate the safety of large language models (LLMs) efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing LLM safety are expensive and slow, making them impractical for quick diagnostics after training new models.

Method: N-GLARE evaluates LLMs' latent representations using Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory (APT) analysis and Jensen-Shannon Separability (JSS) metrics, requiring neither text generation nor extensive black-box analysis.

Result: N-GLARE demonstrates high alignment with safety rankings from traditional red teaming tests across various models and strategies, while reducing cost by over 99%.

Conclusion: N-GLARE provides a cost-effective and rapid tool for real-time LLM safety evaluations, enabling agile diagnostics for new models.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

*Xinlei Xiong,Wenbo Hu,Shuxun Zhou,Kaifeng Bi,Lingxi Xie,Ying Liu,Richang Hong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for weather forecasting, which combines ensemble prediction systems and Bayesian approaches to better decompose predictive uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The chaotic atmosphere necessitates probabilistic methods to handle forecasting uncertainties, but existing methods like ensemble prediction are computationally costly while Bayesian approaches remain disconnected.

Method: A hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian Deep Learning with ensemble prediction. It uses variational inference for epistemic uncertainty and a physics-informed stochastic method for aleatoric uncertainty. It also presents a theoretical connection between BDL and EPS.

Result: The method enhances forecast accuracy while improving uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency, as validated on the 40-year ERA5 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances weather forecasting by offering a unified method for uncertainty quantification, demonstrating accuracy, efficiency, and a theoretical foundation bridging BDL and EPS.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS), improving upon standard SMC methods through variance reduction and path degeneracy mitigation, achieving better performance in reinforcement learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods in reinforcement learning, specifically their high variance and path degeneracy, which hinder scalability with increased search depth.

Method: The authors propose Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS), a novel approach that reduces variance and mitigates path degeneracy, while preserving SMC's suitability for parallelization and GPU acceleration.

Result: TSMCTS outperforms SMC baseline methods and a modern variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in both discrete and continuous environments, demonstrating improved scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: TSMCTS enhances the strengths of SMC methodologies while overcoming key weaknesses, making it a scalable and efficient alternative for model-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

TL;DR: EBind simplifies space binding with a data-centric and parameter-efficient approach, enabling state-of-the-art multimodal models trained on a single GPU in hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and effective training of high-performing multimodal embedding models without the extensive hardware and time resources typically required.

Method: EBind employs a single encoder per modality, curated datasets from automated and human annotations, and evaluates across 13 benchmarks, introducing a novel zero-shot classification benchmark.

Result: A 1.8B-parameter model outperforms models 4-17x its size, with datasets and evaluations proving the value of EBind's approach.

Conclusion: EBind demonstrates the efficiency of small-scale, high-quality data-driven multimodal models; includes plans to open-source its code, weights, and datasets.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

TL;DR: This paper proposes STICA, a novel framework integrating object-centric Transformers and causality-aware decision-making for reinforcement learning, achieving better sample efficiency and performance in object-rich environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the limitations of current world models in accurately replicating high-dimensional, non-stationary environments with multiple interacting objects by taking inspiration from human perception and object decomposition.

Method: STICA leverages object-centric Transformers to represent observations as tokens (objects, agent actions, and rewards) for modeling interactions and uses causality-aware policy and value networks to guide decision-making.

Result: STICA demonstrated superior sample efficiency and performance compared to state-of-the-art agents on various object-rich benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: Breaking down reinforcement learning environments into object-centric components and incorporating causality-aware methods can significantly enhance performance and efficiency in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Result: Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy in solving various linear problems with lower computational overhead compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: General-purpose neural architectures, like Algebraformer, can simplify and accelerate traditional scientific computing tasks, making them viable alternatives for ill-conditioned linear systems.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned.

In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limited scenario applicability and lack of explainability in current multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) methods for vessel behavior prediction in complex maritime environments.

Method: The method includes classifying navigation intentions into sustained and transient categories, using historical data and Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), and adopting a non-local attention mechanism for global scenario consistency.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in prediction metrics (ADE and FDE) and wider applicability across maritime scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances both the performance and explainability of vessel trajectory predictions, paving the way for better intelligent maritime systems.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

TL;DR: The study compares task-agnostic embeddings from tabular foundation models with classical feature engineering, finding that classical methods are faster and often perform comparably or better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the utility of task-agnostic representations for tabular data over direct-prediction approaches in terms of performance and computational efficiency.

Method: Systematic evaluation of TabPFN, TabICL, and TableVectorizer features across tasks like outlier detection and supervised learning.

Result: TableVectorizer features showed comparable or superior performance to tabular foundation models while being significantly faster.

Conclusion: Classical feature engineering methods can be a resource-efficient alternative to tabular foundation models for generating task-agnostic embeddings.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VAR, a regularizer to improve pruning robustness in deep neural networks by increasing parameter variance, maintaining accuracy post-pruning with negligible extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are effective but impractical due to large sizes; aggressive pruning often results in significant accuracy drops. Existing methods mitigate this issue but add computational overhead.

Method: The paper proposes the Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) which increases parameter variance during training, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

Result: VAR achieves superior pruning robustness with high accuracy retention in aggressively pruned models, backed by extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: VAR offers an efficient and computationally accessible solution to improve pruning robustness in deep neural networks, reducing model size without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fréchet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3\%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces tools to address challenges in selecting robust machine learning models in clinical settings under constraints and noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trustworthy deployment and evaluation of machine learning models in clinical applications, where datasets are often small, noisy, and imbalanced.

Method: The authors propose two novel tools: Intervention Efficiency (IE) for evaluating capacity-aware performance and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF) for assessing model stability under data perturbations.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world clinical datasets demonstrate these tools help identify robust models that balance performance and operational constraints.

Conclusion: These tools offer practical solutions to manage the Rashomon Effect in clinical machine learning, facilitating better model selection and deployment.

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

*Aneesh Barthakur,Luiz F. O. Chamon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a generalization theory and practical algorithm for equality-constrained learning problems, addressing challenges in fairness, accuracy, and complex requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning faces increasing complexity and requirements, especially challenges with fairness and equality constraints.

Method: The study derives generalization guarantees for equality-constrained learning and proposes an algorithm solving unconstrained empirical learning problems sequentially.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in fair learning, interpolation, and boundary value problems, enabling new solutions with equality constraints.

Conclusion: Equality-constrained statistical learning problems can be effectively approximated and solved with novel approaches, advancing applications in fairness and other complex ML objectives.

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

### [297] [Enforcing hidden physics in physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14348)
*Nanxi Chen,Sifan Wang,Rujin Ma,Airong Chen,Chuanjie Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a strategy for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enforce the Second Law of Thermodynamics and enhance solution accuracy by adding irreversibility constraints during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs currently fail to consider the irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, leading to unphysical results or training failures, which limits their effectiveness in solving PDEs.

Method: The study introduces an irreversibility-regularized approach that adds soft constraints for hidden physical laws during training to align solutions with the irreversible nature of physical processes.

Result: Their method reduces predictive errors by over an order of magnitude across diverse benchmarks, such as traveling waves, combustion, and ice melting, without requiring significant changes to existing PINN setups.

Conclusion: The regularization scheme enhances accuracy and reliability of PINNs for a broad range of physical systems, promising significant impact in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

*Bastien Vuillod,Pierre-Alain Moellic,Jean-Max Dutertre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on backdoor attacks within Federated Learning (FL), focusing on backdoor lifespan and attack persistence in different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL struggles with security concerns like backdoor attacks, and understanding how techniques like LoRA affect these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving FL systems.

Method: The authors examine the relationship between LoRA ranks and backdoor persistence through experiments, evaluating the influence of LoRA settings on attack scenarios.

Result: The study finds that backdoor persistence increases with lower LoRA ranks, revealing rank-dependent dynamics in security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: This research enhances understanding of backdoor attack dynamics in FL with LoRA, promoting better evaluation methods and improving risk assessments for critical systems.

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

### [299] [Toward Robust and Harmonious Adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14416)
*Haobin Li,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method, REST, to address the issue of query shift in cross-modal retrieval, ensuring online and harmonious adaptation by preserving general knowledge and robustly refining query predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current general-to-customized CMR methods assume the availability of all target-domain data, which isn't practical in real-world scenarios due to the query shift problem that involves online and diverse queries.

Method: The proposed method, REST, refines retrieval results to formulate query predictions and uses a QS-robust objective function for online adaptation. It also employs a gradient decoupling module to prevent the model from forgetting essential knowledge.

Result: REST was rigorously tested on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks and showed effectiveness in handling query shifts.

Conclusion: REST offers a robust approach to online and diverse query shifts by carefully preserving general knowledge and adapting to query variations, proving its efficacy with extensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowRoI, an efficient framework for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies, improving computational efficiency and data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the substantial data storage and transmission challenge posed by the high-throughput imaging platforms like ComplexEye, used for immune cell migration studies.

Method: FlowRoI estimates optical flow between frames to create region-of-interest masks reliably covering migrating cells, which are then JPEG2000 encoded to enable efficient RoI-aware compression.

Result: FlowRoI achieves computational efficiency comparable to standard JPEG2000, processes at an average of 30 frames per second, and offers enhanced compression rates (2.0-2.2x higher) and image quality in cellular regions.

Conclusion: FlowRoI offers a robust, efficient solution for high-throughput image data compression, facilitating improved storage and transmission while maintaining high image quality, critical for clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

*Andrey Okhotin,Maksim Nakhodnov,Nikita Kazeev,Andrey E Ustyuzhanin,Dmitry Vetrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitation of diffusion models in crystal generation by proposing "mirage infusion," enabling atomic state changes, resulting in a more flexible and improved crystal generation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of current diffusion models that are unable to alter the number of atoms in a crystal during generation, hindering the variability and usability of these models.

Method: The paper introduces "mirage infusion," a technique that allows modifying the states of atoms (existent to non-existent and vice versa) during diffusion model operations. This is implemented in an equivariant joint diffusion model called Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD).

Result: MiAD technique improves model quality by up to 2.5x compared to earlier methods and achieves an 8.2% S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: This novel approach significantly enhances the capability of diffusion models for crystal design, setting new benchmarks in the field.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid model to estimate key cardiac biomarkers (stroke volume and cardiac output) non-invasively using PPG signals, outperforming a supervised baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for cardiovascular monitoring often require invasive arterial pressure waveforms, which are impractical in many scenarios. Non-invasive alternatives like PPG measurements are promising but lack accurate methods for estimating key cardiac biomarkers.

Method: The proposed model is a hybrid approach combining a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator trained on simulated APW data.

Result: The approach demonstrated the ability to detect fluctuations in stroke volume and cardiac output, outperforming conventional supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The hybrid method shows promise for continuous and non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring, addressing limitations of traditional methods relying on invasive data.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Conditional Push-Forward Neural Networks (CPFN), a new framework for modeling conditional distributions by learning a stochastic map to approximate the conditional law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of direct conditional density modeling, such as invertibility or adversarial training, and to create an efficient approach to conditional sampling and statistical estimation.

Method: CPFN defines a stochastic mapping function $\varphi(x, u)$, trained using an objective function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, without requiring invertibility or adversarial components.

Result: CPFN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (e.g., kernel estimators, tree-based approaches, and deep learning techniques) while being lightweight and easy to train.

Conclusion: The proposed CPFN framework offers an efficient, consistent, and practical approach to conditional distribution estimation, establishing itself as a feasible alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the tradeoff between standardization and exact behavior in transformer interpretability tools.

Method: They created nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight, with automatic module renaming, validation testing, and built-in interpretability methods.

Result: Nnterp provides a unified interface for analyzing more than 50 model variants across 16 architecture families while ensuring compatibility verification through local validation tests.

Conclusion: Nnterp bridges the usability and correctness gap in mechanistic interpretability tools, enabling streamlined research across diverse transformer architectures.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

TL;DR: PAFM improves time series generation by addressing temporal heterogeneity challenges using a novel flow-matching framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance over strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series generation methods struggle with temporal heterogeneity due to localized perturbations, leading to challenges in maintaining structural consistency.

Method: The proposed PAFM framework uses perturbation-guided training, a dual-path velocity field to model trajectory perturbations, and a mixture-of-experts decoder for adaptive capacity allocation, enhancing coherence and sensitivity.

Result: PAFM outperforms competitive baselines in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks as evidenced by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PAFM framework addresses the limitations of flow matching for perturbed time series, ensuring stable and structurally consistent time series generation while adapting to trajectory dynamics effectively.

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: CLO addresses scalability limits in LLM inference by optimizing CPU and GPU coordination for KVCache offloading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current million-token LLMs push the limits of inference systems where the KVCache creates excessive memory and data transfer overhead.

Method: CLO introduces head-wise GPU caching, combined prefetching/persistent caching, zero-copy PCIe transfers, and GPU-centric synchronization to optimize performance.

Result: CLO improves decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%, reduces CPU misuse, and fully utilizes PCIe bandwidth, while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Algorithm-system co-design is critical for optimizing memory-constrained LLM inference, demonstrated effectively by CLO's capabilities.

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PepBFN is a novel Bayesian flow network designed for computational peptide design that overcomes challenges like category sampling mismatches and unimodal torsion angle assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for peptide binder design face challenges like disruptive update dynamics from categorical sampling and limited prediction accuracy due to unimodal torsion angle assumptions, necessitating more refined approaches.

Method: PepBFN introduces fully continuous parameter distributions for discrete residue types, a Gaussian mixture Bayesian flow for multimodal side-chain torsion angles, and a Matrix Fisher Riemannian flow for residue orientations.

Result: Experiments confirm PepBFN’s strength in diverse peptide design tasks, including side-chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design.

Conclusion: PepBFN provides a robust solution for addressing limitations in peptide binder design by modeling distributions in continuous space for smoother and more coherent generation.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework tailored to impute mixed-type tabular data efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with imputing mixed-type tabular data due to limitations in managing heterogeneous features under a single diffusion process.

Method: The framework separates numerical and categorical features into complementary channels: continuous DDIM for numerical and discrete latent-path diffusion for categorical features. Both channels are trained under unified conditional imputation objectives.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show improved accuracy, stability, and robustness across multiple missing data settings (MCAR, MAR, MNAR).

Conclusion: The structure-aware diffusion framework is effective for imputing incomplete mixed-type data, advancing deep learning approaches in this domain.

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of Warping Index (WI), a new metric addressing visual distortions not adequately captured by previous Projection Quality Metrics in Dimensionality Reduction projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the assessment of DR projections' visual quality, addressing distortions like outliers or artifacts ignored by existing metrics focusing solely on global or local structure.

Method: Developing the Warping Index (WI), a metric based on preserving empty regions between points to ensure a faithful visual representation of data.

Result: Warping Index (WI) introduces a novel approach to quantify the visual fidelity of DR projections, capturing aspects neglected by traditional metrics.

Conclusion: WI provides an enhanced measure for evaluating DR projections, emphasizing visual integrity and supporting more accurate visual data analysis.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

*Adam Hazimeh,Alessandro Favero,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of task arithmetic in closed-vocabulary image classification models, finding that pre-training naturally enables task editing in these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether task arithmetic, commonly used for open-vocabulary models, is applicable to closed-vocabulary models, aiming for efficient multi-task deployment.

Method: The authors analyze various pre-training schemes to study weight disentanglement and apply task arithmetic to closed-vocabulary vision transformers.

Result: Pre-trained closed-vocabulary models exhibit weight disentanglement, enabling task arithmetic with high task addition performance. Linear probing also emerges as a strong alternative approach.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic can effectively expand to closed-vocabulary models, offering efficient multi-task modeling and allowing broader use cases for pre-trained models.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

*Ankush Kadu,Ashwanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReflexGrad integrates hierarchical decomposition, causal reflection, and gradient optimization into a unified system to achieve zero-shot generalization, attaining strong performance on ALFWorld tasks without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in reinforcement learning and decision-making by enabling agents to generalize across tasks without requiring task-specific training or examples.

Method: The paper introduces ReflexGrad, a system combining LLM-based TODO decomposition, history-aware causal reflection for learning from failure, and gradient-based optimization for improving performance. No task-specific training is required.

Result: ReflexGrad showed a 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 for ALFWorld tasks, improved performance through task transfer, and achieved stable convergence with zero action loops.

Conclusion: Synergistic integration of complementary mechanisms enables ReflexGrad to achieve effective zero-shot generalization, approaching the performance of few-shot baselines without prior demonstrations or hardcoding.

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a method to learn POMDP parameters accurately when data is scarce and noisy, particularly in healthcare contexts.

Method: Incorporates fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined model into the EM framework, reformulating the learning process as Maximum A Posteriori estimation.

Result: Outperforms standard EM algorithm in synthetic medical simulations under low-data, high-noise settings, and successfully models Myasthenia Gravis as a clinically valid POMDP.

Conclusion: The Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm is an effective and practical tool for data-efficient modeling, showcasing potential applications in healthcare.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

*Ivy Yuqian Yang,David Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the failure of modern large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs that follow predefined probabilistic distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand whether LLMs can perform probabilistic exploration—a necessary ability for scientific idea generation—since current AI benchmarks focus primarily on finding objectively correct answers.

Method: Systematic experiments were conducted to test LLM outputs against simple probabilistic distribution requests, such as generating a binary output of '1' with 49% probability.

Result: Results revealed that modern LLMs fail to adhere to probabilistic distributions, often exclusively generating the output with the highest marginal probability instead.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs lack the capability for probabilistic exploration, which is essential for certain tasks like scientific idea generation, limiting their utility in these domains.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

*Yuchen Luo,Xinyu Li,Liuhua Peng,Mingming Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Adapformer, a Transformer-based framework for multivariate time series forecasting, which overcomes limitations of existing methods by balancing channel-independent and channel-dependent strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of effectively modeling complex dependencies in multivariate time series forecasting by overcoming limitations of channel-independent and channel-dependent methods.

Method: The method introduces the Adapformer, combining a dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture with Adaptive Channel Enhancer (ACE) and Adaptive Channel Forecaster (ACF) components to enrich embedding and refine predictions.

Result: Adapformer delivers superior performance in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing models, as verified by tests on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Adapformer is a state-of-the-art framework for multivariate time series forecasting, successfully addressing dependencies and noise challenges while improving efficiency.

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

*Vaskar Chakma,MD Jaheid Hasan Nerab,Abdur Rouf,Abu Sayed,Hossem MD Saim,Md. Nournabi Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study assesses machine learning's capability to identify smoking-related health risks, using health data from 55,691 individuals. The Random Forest algorithm achieved outstanding accuracy in detecting smoking-related risks, with a focus on interpretability and practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current medical screening methods that often miss early-warning signs of smoking-related health problems, which lead to late diagnoses and restricted treatment options.

Method: A systematic and comparative evaluation of machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) was conducted using cross-sectional analysis of health screening data, emphasizing biomarkers to classify smoking status. Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP analysis.

Result: The Random Forest model achieved an AUC of 0.926, making it highly accurate at distinguishing at-risk smokers from others. Blood pressure, triglycerides, liver enzymes, and kidney function (serum creatinine) were identified as the most telling health markers for smokers.

Conclusion: Machine learning, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, offers a reliable screening tool for assessing health risks among smokers. This approach reveals the importance of key health markers in early smoking-related risk detection and promotes its application in practical health contexts.

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

### [317] [AdamHD: Decoupled Huber Decay Regularization for Language Model Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14721)
*Fu-Ming Guo,Yingfang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AdamHuberDecay, an adaptive optimizer replacing the quadratic weight decay in AdamW with a smooth Huber regularizer, achieving faster convergence, reduced perplexity, and improved downstream task performance with memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard quadratic $ penalty$ in AdamW drives parameter decay equally across all directions, making it sensitive to extreme gradients and prone to over-penalization of well-conditioned weights.

Method: AdamHuberDecay employs a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer, replacing the $ penalty$ with a combination of quadratic and linear decay dependent on parameter magnitude. This allows bounded regularization, invariance to rescaling, and stronger sparsity pressure for specific weights.

Result: AdamHuberDecay converges 10-15% faster, reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, improves downstream task performance by 2.5-4.7%, and enables 20-30% memory savings through sparsity without additional tuning beyond AdamW's defaults.

Conclusion: AdamHuberDecay offers an efficient and robust alternative for training large generative models like GPT-2/3, addressing key drawbacks in AdamW and supporting next-generation transformer infrastructure.

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $δ$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $δ$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called LAUD that combines large language models (LLMs) and active learning for handling unlabeled datasets, showing improved performance in commodity name classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many practitioners struggle with obtaining high-performing LLMs due to the lack of labeled data, relying instead on inefficient prompt-based methods. This paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: The authors introduced LAUD, integrating LLMs with active learning, creating an initial labeled dataset via zero-shot learning to mitigate the cold-start problem.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs empowered by LAUD outperform zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques in commodity name classification tasks.

Conclusion: LAUD is effective in improving LLM performance with minimal labeled data, proving its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a tailored Gaussian process model for aggregating online ratings, offering enhanced predictive accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard aggregation methods like sample mean fail to capture quality changes over time and review heterogeneity, limiting their usefulness for decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces a Gaussian process model tailored to capture rating dynamics over time and account for variations in review sentiment and helpfulness.

Result: Using Yelp data, the Gaussian process model predicted future ratings with greater accuracy, reducing mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean.

Conclusion: Employment of advanced aggregation methods like Gaussian processes allows online platforms to provide more dynamic and accurate representations of customer satisfaction, benefiting marketing practitioners and customers.

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning's impact since 2015 has transformed drug discovery, but the advancements in bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods are unclear due to dataset alterations. A reproducible leaderboard ensures comparability using the original Tox21 Challenge dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the improvements in bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods over the past decade amidst concerns of dataset inconsistencies in benchmarks.

Method: Introduction of a reproducible leaderboard hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, providing baseline methods and evaluation using publicly accessible models.

Result: The leaderboard reveals the original Tox21 winner and self-normalizing neural networks from 2017 still perform competitively, questioning progress in toxicity prediction.

Conclusion: Substantial progress in toxicity prediction methods in the past decade remains unclear; the leaderboard ensures transparency and comparability, aiding future research.

Abstract: Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SparseST, an efficient framework that uses data sparsity to address computational burdens in spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) and provides guidance for balancing model performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient AI solutions to enable STDM models to work on resource-constrained edge devices, especially since existing approaches focus on reducing model redundancy rather than feature/data redundancy.

Method: The authors developed SparseST, a framework that leverages data sparsity to improve efficiency in spatiotemporal models. They also designed a multi-objective composite loss function to approximate the Pareto front for balancing performance and efficiency.

Result: SparseST successfully utilizes data sparsity, achieving computational efficiency while preserving model performance. The proposed loss function offers guidance for tuning efficiency and performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: This research provides an innovative perspective by addressing data redundancy in STDM, enhancing efficiency for edge computing, and introducing a practical optimization method for broad use in complex physical systems.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

*Yimeng Fan,Changsong Liu,Mingyang Li,Yuzhou Dai,Yanyan Liu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS2Edge, a spiking neural network (SNN)-based edge detection model that surpasses conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), achieving energy efficiency, crisp edge maps, and state-of-the-art performance without pre-trained backbones or post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in edge detection, such as high energy consumption due to reliance on pre-trained models and complex designs, as well as poor edge crispness and reliance on post-processing in traditional ANN approaches.

Method: Proposed MS2Edge, utilizing a novel spiking backbone (MS2ResNet) to integrate multi-scale residual learning, minimize quantization errors with I-LIF neurons and Membrane-based Deformed Shortcuts, enhance details with Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB), and integrate edge maps using Membrane Average Decoding (MAD).

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on datasets like BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, PLDU, and PLDM, delivering crisp edges without pre-trained backbones or post-processing, while maintaining ultra-low energy consumption.

Conclusion: MS2Edge demonstrates the potential of SNNs for efficient and high-quality edge detection, addressing challenges of previous ANN-based methods and establishing a new benchmark.

Abstract: Edge detection with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has achieved remarkable prog\-ress but faces two major challenges. First, it requires pre-training on large-scale extra data and complex designs for prior knowledge, leading to high energy consumption. Second, the predicted edges perform poorly in crispness and heavily rely on post-processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as third generation neural networks, feature quantization and spike-driven computation mechanisms. They inherently provide a strong prior for edge detection in an energy-efficient manner, while its quantization mechanism helps suppress texture artifact interference around true edges, improving prediction crispness. However, the resulting quantization error inevitably introduces sparse edge discontinuities, compromising further enhancement of crispness. To address these challenges, we propose MS2Edge, the first SNN-based model for edge detection. At its core, we build a novel spiking backbone named MS2ResNet that integrates multi-scale residual learning to recover missing boundary lines and generate crisp edges, while combining I-LIF neurons with Membrane-based Deformed Shortcut (MDS) to mitigate quantization errors. The model is complemented by a Spiking Multi-Scale Upsample Block (SMSUB) for detail reconstruction during upsampling and a Membrane Average Decoding (MAD) method for effective integration of edge maps across multiple time steps. Experimental results demonstrate that MS2Edge outperforms ANN-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, PLDU, and PLDM datasets without pre-trained backbones, while maintaining ultralow energy consumption and generating crisp edge maps without post-processing.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper applies recent perceptron theories to predict and optimize memory capacity and accuracy in echo state networks (ESNs), leading to a new untrained ESN readout model with enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of selecting ESN models and hyperparameters optimally for specific applications by establishing a predictive, theory-based framework.

Method: The authors use developments in perceptron theory to predict the performance of 30 variants of ESN models across various configurations and demonstrate empirical validation and practical optimization guided by this theory.

Result: The theory accurately predicts ESN performance across 30 variants. An untrained ESN model with superior performance is proposed, and the geometry of readout networks linked to simplex-like structures is characterized.

Conclusion: This work improves ESN model selection, introduces an efficient untrained ESN model, and highlights fundamental geometric properties in ESN readout networks.

Abstract: In reservoir computing, an input sequence is processed by a recurrent neural network, the reservoir, which transforms it into a spatial pattern that a shallow readout network can then exploit for tasks such as memorization and time-series prediction or classification. Echo state networks (ESN) are a model class in which the reservoir is a traditional artificial neural network. This class contains many model types, each with sets of hyperparameters. Selecting models and parameter settings for particular applications requires a theory for predicting and comparing performances. Here, we demonstrate that recent developments of perceptron theory can be used to predict the memory capacity and accuracy of a wide variety of ESN models, including reservoirs with linear neurons, sigmoid nonlinear neurons, different types of recurrent matrices, and different types of readout networks. Across thirty variants of ESNs, we show that empirical results consistently confirm the theory's predictions. As a practical demonstration, the theory is used to optimize memory capacity of an ESN in the entire joint parameter space. Further, guided by the theory, we propose a novel ESN model with a readout network that does not require training, and which outperforms earlier ESN models without training. Finally, we characterize the geometry of the readout networks in ESNs, which reveals that many ESN models exhibit a similar regular simplex geometry as has been observed in the output weights of deep neural networks.

*Kallol Mondal,Ankush Kumar*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces S$^{2}$TDPT, a neuromorphic transformer utilizing STDP for energy-efficient, hardware-compatible self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the energy inefficiency, non-neuromorphic design, and divergence from brain-like attention seen in existing Transformer models.

Method: The proposed Spiking STDP Transformer replaces traditional attention mechanisms with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query-key correlations in synaptic weights.

Result: S$^{2}$TDPT achieved 94.35% and 78.08% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively, with substantial energy savings (88.47%) compared to standard Transformer models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates biologically inspired attention through STDP can create energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and interpretable neuromorphic models.

Abstract: Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.

### [326] [FICO: Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization for Unified Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13961)
*Jiarui Li,Alessandro Zanardi,Runyu Zhang,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system-level framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) that integrates planning and execution, addressing uncertainties and providing real-time responses for thousands of agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAPF approaches treat planning and execution separately and solve variants of the problem in ad hoc ways, lacking a unified system-level modeling approach.

Method: The authors propose the MAPF system as a formal model integrating planning and execution. They introduce FICO, a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control for efficient closed-loop operation.

Result: FICO reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods and improves throughput under stochastic delays and dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to MAPF, integrating execution and planning, scaling to large systems, and adapting effectively to uncertainties in real-time operations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robust real-time perception in autonomous robots for safe navigation, especially in search & rescue scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces LIO-MARS which aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with Gaussian mixture models using continuous-time B-spline trajectory, incorporating new scan window configurations, Kronecker-based computational acceleration, and motion compensation techniques.

Result: The system was evaluated across various datasets and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance compared to recent LIO systems for mobile platforms.

Conclusion: LIO-MARS enhances robustness, computational efficiency, and accuracy for autonomous robotic navigation using LiDAR-inertial integration.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems heavily rely on environment knowledge to safely navigate. For search & rescue, a flying robot requires robust real-time perception, enabled by complementary sensors. IMU data constrains acceleration and rotation, whereas LiDAR measures accurate distances around the robot. Building upon the LiDAR odometry MARS, our LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) jointly aligns multi-resolution surfel maps with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using a continuous-time B-spline trajectory. Our new scan window uses non-uniform temporal knot placement to ensure continuity over the whole trajectory without additional scan delay. Moreover, we accelerate essential covariance and GMM computations with Kronecker sums and products by a factor of 3.3. An unscented transform de-skews surfels, while a splitting into intra-scan segments facilitates motion compensation during spline optimization. Complementary soft constraints on relative poses and preintegrated IMU pseudo-measurements further improve robustness and accuracy. Extensive evaluation showcases the state-of-the-art quality of our LIO-MARS w.r.t. recent LIO systems on various handheld, ground and aerial vehicle-based datasets.

*Taijing Chen,Sateesh Kumar,Junhong Xu,George Pavlakos,J oydeep Biswas,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAR, a framework unifying memory queries and embodied actions for efficient object retrieval in dynamic environments by leveraging non-parametric memory and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods in retrieving objects in open-world settings, combining spatial and temporal reasoning with embodied interaction.

Method: STAR uses a decision loop integrating long-term and working memory with vision-language models for spatial-temporal actions, and introduces a benchmark for testing in real and simulated scenarios.

Result: Experiments demonstrate STAR's superiority in object search tasks over existing scene-graph and memory-only approaches in both simulated and real environments.

Conclusion: STAR effectively unifies spatial and temporal search into a single approach, showcasing significant performance benefits in dynamic object retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Service robots must retrieve objects in dynamic, open-world settings where requests may reference attributes ("the red mug"), spatial context ("the mug on the table"), or past states ("the mug that was here yesterday"). Existing approaches capture only parts of this problem: scene graphs capture spatial relations but ignore temporal grounding, temporal reasoning methods model dynamics but do not support embodied interaction, and dynamic scene graphs handle both but remain closed-world with fixed vocabularies. We present STAR (SpatioTemporal Active Retrieval), a framework that unifies memory queries and embodied actions within a single decision loop. STAR leverages non-parametric long-term memory and a working memory to support efficient recall, and uses a vision-language model to select either temporal or spatial actions at each step. We introduce STARBench, a benchmark of spatiotemporal object search tasks across simulated and real environments. Experiments in STARBench and on a Tiago robot show that STAR consistently outperforms scene-graph and memory-only baselines, demonstrating the benefits of treating search in time and search in space as a unified problem.

*Jaskirat Singh,Rohan Chandra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FACA, a novel collision avoidance approach for multi-robot systems using natural language communication, balancing safety and agility for high-speed operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in multi-robot systems navigating tightly constrained and crowded spaces, especially where rapid priority changes occur and high-speed agility is needed.

Method: The paper proposes FACA, which enables robots to communicate via natural language and applies an artificial potential field algorithm for collision avoidance, creating a roundabout effect during conflicts.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that FACA improves efficiency by completing missions over 3.5 times faster than existing approaches, reducing time by 70% while maintaining strong safety outcomes.

Conclusion: FACA effectively balances safety and agility in multi-robot systems navigating constrained environments, proving its potential for critical applications with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly being used for critical applications such as rescuing injured people, delivering food and medicines, and monitoring key areas. These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins.

*Hesam Mojtahedi,Reza Akhavian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using BIM and active LiDAR sensing for safer, efficient UAV and UGV navigation in dynamic construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional navigation systems, which rely on static BIM models or onboard perceptions, and to improve navigation safety and efficiency in dynamic construction sites.

Method: The framework fuses real-time LiDAR data from UAVs and UGVs with BIM priors to update a 2D occupancy map. A corridor-risk metric evaluates navigation safety and triggers UAV rescan to reduce risks and update plans autonomously.

Result: Simulation results show a 58% reduction in corridor risk and a 43% decrease in map entropy compared to static BIM navigation. It achieves equivalent uncertainty reduction in half the mission time compared to frontier-based exploration.

Conclusion: Integrating BIM priors with adaptive aerial sensing significantly enhances navigation safety, uncertainty management, and efficiency in construction robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a BIM-discrepancy-driven active sensing framework for cooperative navigation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in dynamic construction environments. Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics.

Conclusion: FlexiCup provides a novel, versatile solution for robotic manipulation challenges, significantly improving performance in sensing and control paradigms.

Abstract: Conventional suction cups lack sensing capabilities for contact-aware manipulation in unstructured environments. This paper presents FlexiCup, a fully wireless multimodal suction cup that integrates dual-zone vision-tactile sensing. The central zone dynamically switches between vision and tactile modalities via illumination control for contact detection, while the peripheral zone provides continuous spatial awareness for approach planning. FlexiCup supports both vacuum and Bernoulli suction modes through modular mechanical configurations, achieving complete wireless autonomy with onboard computation and power. We validate hardware versatility through dual control paradigms. Modular perception-driven grasping across structured surfaces with varying obstacle densities demonstrates comparable performance between vacuum (90.0% mean success) and Bernoulli (86.7% mean success) modes. Diffusion-based end-to-end learning achieves 73.3% success on inclined transport and 66.7% on orange extraction tasks. Ablation studies confirm that multi-head attention coordinating dual-zone observations provides 13% improvements for contact-aware manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses AsyncVLA, a new asynchronous flow matching method for vision-language-action models to improve long-horizon task stability and self-correction, achieving state-of-the-art results for robotic manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the instability and cascading failures of synchronous flow matching in vision-language-action models for long-horizon tasks.

Method: Proposed AsyncVLA framework introducing asynchronous flow matching, leveraging temporal flexibility, action context awareness, and a confidence rater for self-correction in action token generation.

Result: AsyncVLA demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in robotic manipulation benchmarks, showing data efficiency and robust self-correction capabilities.

Conclusion: AsyncVLA overcomes the limitations of synchronous flow matching, enhancing stability and performance in vision-language-action models with its asynchronous generation approach.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

Conclusion: RoboTidy addresses critical limitations of existing benchmarks by offering a platform that bridges gaps in embodied AI, advancing holistic assessments of language-guided robotics in household settings.

Abstract: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.

Conclusion: VLA-Pilot enhances the performance of pre-trained VLA models during real-world deployment, enabling effective zero-shot generalization across tasks and robotic embodiments.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-variable characterisation method to improve the study of physical interactions between wearable robots and human tissues, focusing on both normal and tangential forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe and comfortable interactions with wearable robots by improving the analysis of complex physical interactions, specifically accounting for motion and non-linear soft tissue behavior.

Method: A dual-variable characterisation approach incorporating both normal and tangential forces, analyzing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) for different scenarios and materials.

Result: This method highlights the importance of dual-variable characterisation, showing its potential to enhance accuracy in modeling force and torque responses in wearable robot interfaces.

Conclusion: Incorporating two variables in soft tissue characterisation significantly improves the reliability of interaction metrics and provides insights for better simulations of wearable robot interfaces.

Abstract: Understanding the physical interaction with wearable robots is essential to ensure safety and comfort. However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the inefficiency and limitations of Active SLAM in handling exploration tasks in large-scale and diverse environments, where existing methods struggle with suboptimal paths and extended exploration durations.

Method: MA-SLAM utilizes a novel structured map representation, which discretizes spatial data and integrates boundary points and historical trajectories. This serves as input for a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) decision module combined with a global planner for optimizing exploration paths using long-range target points.

Result: The proposed MA-SLAM method significantly reduces both the time and distance needed for exploration compared to state-of-the-art approaches, as confirmed by experiments in simulation environments and real-world deployment on an unmanned ground vehicle.

Conclusion: MA-SLAM offers an efficient solution for Active SLAM tasks in large-scale environments by employing innovative map representation and path planning techniques, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in exploration efficiency.

Abstract: Active Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (Active SLAM) involves the strategic planning and precise control of a robotic system's movement in order to construct a highly accurate and comprehensive representation of its surrounding environment, which has garnered significant attention within the research community. While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The system performs real-time SLAM on a DJI Tello drone with monocular cameras and inertial sensors, demonstrating autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance indoors and on the TUM RGBD dataset.

Conclusion: This approach achieves accurate, real-time mapping and navigation on low-power platforms, presenting a practical solution for SLAM under resource constraints.

Abstract: Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms estimate drone poses and build a 3D map using a single camera. Current algorithms include sparse methods that lack detailed geometry, while learning-driven approaches produce dense maps but are computationally intensive. Monocular SLAM also faces scale ambiguities, which affect its accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-aware lightweight monocular SLAM system combining sparse keypoint-based pose estimation with dense edge reconstruction. Our method employs deep learning-based depth prediction and edge detection, followed by optimization to refine keypoints and edges for geometric consistency, without relying on global loop closure or heavy neural computations. We fuse inertial data with vision by using an extended Kalman filter to resolve scale ambiguity and improve accuracy. The system operates in real time on low-power platforms, as demonstrated on a DJI Tello drone with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. In addition, we demonstrate robust autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in indoor corridors and on the TUM RGBD dataset. Our approach offers an effective, practical solution to real-time mapping and navigation in resource-constrained environments.

Result: CCoL improves task performance by an average of 8.0% across simulation suites, with up to 19.2% improvement in certain tasks, and demonstrates strong generalization to real-world environments on a 7-DoF robot.

Conclusion: CCoL enhances action trajectory execution and semantic alignment, overcoming limitations of existing methods and improving performance in diverse, practical robotic tasks.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

*Rickmer Krohn,Vignesh Prasad,Gabriele Tiboni,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSDP, a framework combining multisensory data and robust representations to enhance policy learning in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robotic manipulation involving noisy sensory data and dynamic changes, enabling effective multisensory integration for robust control.

Method: MSDP uses masked autoencoding with a transformer-based encoder for multisensory representation learning and a cross-attention asymmetric architecture for efficient policy learning.

Result: MSDP outperforms in robustness under perturbations, achieving high success rates in robot manipulation tasks with limited online interactions.

Conclusion: MSDP offers a compelling approach for multisensory robotic control, showcasing practicality in real-world applications with efficient training and high robustness.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

### [342] [Mutation Testing for Industrial Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14432)
*Marcela Gonçalves dos Santos,Sylvain Hallé,Fábio Petrillo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops domain-specific mutation testing operators for Industrial Robotic Systems to enhance the reliability and safety of robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Failures in industrial robotic systems can lead to accidents and downtime. Reliable software is vital, but traditional mutation testing methods are insufficient for robotics due to specific features like command messaging and physical-world interactions.

Method: The paper introduces domain-specific mutation operators tailored to robot actions and sensor processes, focusing on high-level functions like movements, gripper mechanics, and sensor noise injection.

Result: An empirical study on pick-and-place robotic scenarios showed these new mutation operators generate more relevant mutants, reducing invalid and equivalent cases compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Domain-specific mutation testing strategies improve test suite effectiveness and strengthen IRS safety and reliability.

Abstract: Industrial robotic systems (IRS) are increasingly deployed in diverse environments, where failures can result in severe accidents and costly downtime. Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems.

*Marlow Fawn,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance unsafe robot policies with safety guarantees by using Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) and demonstrates its effectiveness through a proof-of-concept involving a robot arm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring that robot policies, which are often designed for task completion, also guarantee safety during operation.

Method: The authors propose combining HCLBFs derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) with existing robot policies using HCLBF-based safety certificates, ensuring safety without compromising task objectives.

Result: A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that a stationary robot arm with a reinforcement learning-based movement policy manages to avoid collisions when integrated with the proposed safety constraints.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances the safety of robotic policies without hindering task performance and can be extended to handle complex specifications and dynamic tasks.

Abstract: We propose a method for combining Harmonic Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (HCLBFs) derived from Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications with any given robot policy to turn an unsafe policy into a safe one with formal guarantees.  The two components are combined via HCLBF-derived safety certificates, thus producing commands that preserve both safety and task-driven behavior.  We demonstrate with a simple proof-of-concept implementation for an object-centric force-based policy trained through reinforcement learning for a movement task of a stationary robot arm that is able to avoid colliding with obstacles on a table top after combining the policy with the safety constraints.  The proposed method can be generalized to more complex specifications and dynamic task settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robotic platform aimed at improving minimally invasive procedures in open cavities through advanced flexible endoscopy and enhanced field-of-view capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of flexible robots in minimally invasive surgery within open cavities, such as control complexity and restricted situational awareness from traditional endoscopes.

Method: The platform consists of a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope, integrated with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation for laser ablations, and real-time endoscopic scene reconstruction for enhanced visualization.

Result: The robotic system successfully overcame MIS limitations and demonstrated its effectiveness in a complex surgery setting through in vivo validation in an ovine model.

Conclusion: The system showcases promise in enhancing open cavity surgeries by combining precise control, extended visualization, and scalability for complex procedures like fetoscopic laser coagulation.

Abstract: Flexible robots hold great promise for enhancing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by providing superior dexterity, precise control, and safe tissue interaction. Yet, translating these advantages into endoscopic interventions within open cavities remains challenging. The lack of anatomical constraints and the inherent flexibility of such devices complicate their control, while the limited field of view of endoscopes restricts situational awareness. We present a robotic platform designed to overcome these challenges and demonstrate its potential in fetoscopic laser coagulation, a complex MIS procedure typically performed only by highly experienced surgeons. Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations. To enhance surgical awareness, the platform reconstructs real-time mosaics of the endoscopic scene, providing an extended and continuous visual context. The ability of this system to address the key limitations of MIS in open spaces is validated in vivo in an ovine model.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated firefighting system combining UAVs and motorized fire monitors to efficiently combat industrial fires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial fires are challenging due to building size, visual obstructions, and inaccurate fire location assessments, causing increased damage and prolonged firefighting operations.

Method: The system integrates UAVs for autonomous heat source detection and localization with a turntable ladder and fire monitor controlled via handheld operator input. UAVs navigate obstacle-free paths and perform triangulation-based fire localization.

Result: Preliminary tests demonstrated the system's ability to locate multiple heat sources and direct water jets accurately to extinguish fires.

Conclusion: The proposed system shows promise in enhancing firefighting efficiency and precision for industrial facilities through automation and aerial support.

Abstract: Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
  We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.

### [346] [Masked IRL: LLM-Guided Reward Disambiguation from Demonstrations and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14565)
*Minyoung Hwang,Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Nathaniel Dennler,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL) to combine user demonstrations and natural language instructions, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance reward learning and tackle ambiguity in both input types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots learning reward functions from demonstrations often fail to generalize and overfit due to limited data and focus on irrelevant state details. Leveraging natural language could address these limitations by providing direct guidance on task relevance.

Method: Masked IRL uses LLMs to generate state-relevance masks from language instructions and ensures invariance to irrelevant state details. The framework also employs LLM reasoning to clarify ambiguous language using the context from demonstrations.

Result: Masked IRL achieves up to 15% improvement over prior language-conditioned IRL methods and reduces data usage by up to 4.7 times. It demonstrated enhanced sample efficiency, generalization, and robustness in simulated and real robot environments.

Conclusion: Combining demonstrations and language instructions with LLMs in Masked IRL significantly improves reward learning by exploiting the complementary strengths of both inputs and resolving ambiguities effectively.

Abstract: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSBench, a benchmark for assessing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in autonomous driving safety, addressing both environmental and in-cabin risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models for autonomous driving fail to adequately evaluate safety-critical scenarios, which necessitates a comprehensive benchmark for this purpose.

Method: Developed DSBench—a unified evaluation system with 10 categories and 28 sub-categories. Created a large dataset of 98K instances for fine-tuning VLMs.

Result: Evaluations showed performance degradation of VLMs in safety-critical contexts, but fine-tuning using the constructed dataset significantly improved their safety performance.

Conclusion: DSBench is critical for assessing and improving VLMs in autonomous driving safety, underscoring its potential to drive advancements in this technology.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.

*Qingwei Ben,Botian Xu,Kailin Li,Feiyu Jia,Wentao Zhang,Jingping Wang,Jingbo Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gallant, a framework using voxelized LiDAR data for humanoid locomotion, enabling robust navigation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception methods for humanoid locomotion lack comprehensive 3D visibility and global consistency, limiting navigation in highly constrained terrains.

Method: Gallant utilizes voxelized LiDAR data as its perceptual basis, processed by a z-grouped 2D CNN for end-to-end control policy optimization.

Result: Gallant achieves near 100% success rates in scenarios like stair climbing and platform stepping, proving its scalability and effectiveness in 3D environments.

Conclusion: The framework expands humanoid navigation capabilities to complex constrained terrains, showcasing improved perception and control policy optimization.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion requires accurate and globally consistent perception of the surrounding 3D environment. However, existing perception modules, mainly based on depth images or elevation maps, offer only partial and locally flattened views of the environment, failing to capture the full 3D structure. This paper presents Gallant, a voxel-grid-based framework for humanoid locomotion and local navigation in 3D constrained terrains. It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces NORA-1.5, a Vision-Language-Action model enhanced with a flow-matching-based expert and reward-driven post-training, achieving improved reliability and task performance for embodied tasks in both simulated and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models currently face challenges in reliability and generalization for different embodiments or environments.

Method: NORA-1.5 adds a flow-matching-based action expert and uses reward models combining action-conditioned world models and deviation-from-ground-truth heuristics for post-training policies.

Result: NORA-1.5 outperforms previous models in benchmarks, and reward-driven post-training provides significant improvements in reliability and task success across simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: NORA-1.5, along with reward-guided post-training, offers a promising approach to developing dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

*Albert Lin,Alessandro Pinto,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoVer-CoRe, a framework leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of perception-based controllers under perceptual uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal verification of perception-based autonomous controllers is critical due to growing real-world applications, but challenges arise from system complexity and perceptual uncertainty.

Method: The authors concatenate the controller, observation function, and state estimation modules to create a closed-loop system compatible with Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, enabling robust verification and controller design.

Result: RoVer-CoRe accurately verifies perception-based systems in scenarios like aircraft taxiing and neural network-based rover navigation, demonstrating robustness and applicability.

Conclusion: This framework is a novel approach to addressing perceptual uncertainty in safety-critical systems, advancing verification capabilities for complex controllers.

Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often encounter difficulties in real-world tasks due to the dynamics of interactions such as varying payloads and contact issues. The paper aims to improve robot performance in such environments by leveraging heterogeneous control methods.

Method: The paper proposes HMC-Controller to blend control profiles (position, impedance, and hybrid force-position) and HMC-Policy to unify controllers using a mixture-of-experts approach, enabling robust force-aware policy learning.

Result: Experiments on a humanoid robot demonstrate more than 50% performance improvement on tasks like table wiping and drawer opening compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed HMC framework effectively improves robot performance in real-world loco-manipulation tasks by adaptively combining different control modalities and learning robust policies.

Abstract: Learning from real-world robot demonstrations holds promise for interacting with complex real-world environments. However, the complexity and variability of interaction dynamics often cause purely positional controllers to struggle with contacts or varying payloads. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC.

*Jeremiah Bohr*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Language models tend to generate verbose code, but stylistic control can be managed through instruction-based and example-based prompts, with combined prompts proving most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different prompt designs influence the degree of verbosity and stylistic control when language models enhance code implementations.

Method: The study deployed a paired two-turn protocol analyzing four prompt conditions, where models generated intermediate Python code and revised it under improvement directives, examining both initial compression and expansion discipline (N = 160 paired programs).

Result: Combined prompts provided the strongest control over initial verbosity and disciplined expansions, instructions had moderate expansion discipline, and examples showed limited stylistic control.

Conclusion: Stylistic control can be optimized by combining instruction- and example-based prompts, as these approaches are complementary in initial and revision stages of code generation.

Abstract: Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.

*Daihan Xu,Diana Martin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ChatGPT offers valuable assistance to students tackling programming tasks but also raises ethical concerns, warranting clear educational guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how computer science students ethically and strategically use ChatGPT in software development tasks and their understanding of related ethical issues.

Method: Used qualitative research through semi-structured interviews with students from a UK institution.

Result: Students use ChatGPT for conceptual understanding and programming assistance, limiting its contribution to 30%, yet concerns arise over critical engagement with AI-generated code.

Conclusion: Students need clear guidelines from educators to ensure responsible, ethical, and pedagogically effective use of AI tools in academic and professional settings.

Abstract: ChatGPT has been increasingly used in computer science, offering efficient support across software development tasks. While it helps students navigate programming challenges, its use also raises concerns about academic integrity and overreliance. Despite growing interest in this topic, prior research has largely relied on surveys, emphasizing trends over in-depth analysis of students' strategies and ethical awareness. This study complements existing work through a qualitative investigation of how computer science students in one UK institution strategically and ethically engage with ChatGPT in software development projects. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, it explores two key questions: How do computer science students ethically and strategically report using ChatGPT in software development projects? How do students understand and perceive the ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT in academic and professional contexts? Findings reveal a shift in students' learning models, moving from traditional "independent thinking-manual coding-iterative debugging" to "AI-assisted ideation-interactive programming-collaborative optimization." Importantly, many use ChatGPT conversationally to deepen understanding, while consciously reserving creative and high-level decision-making tasks for themselves. Students tend to cap ChatGPT's contribution to roughly 30%, and evaluate its output to mitigate overreliance. However, only a minority thoroughly analyze AI-generated code, raising concerns about reduced critical engagement. Meanwhile, students reject uncredited use, highlight risks such as privacy breaches and skill degradation, and call for clear usage guidelines set by their teachers. This research offers novel insights into the evolving learner-AI dynamic and highlights the need for explicit guidance to support responsible and pedagogically sound use of such tools.

TL;DR: LoCoBench-Agent is a new benchmark for assessing large language model (LLM) agents in realistic, long-context software engineering scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture interactive, multi-turn, tool-using, and adaptive reasoning aspects crucial for real-world coding agents.

Method: LoCoBench-Agent builds upon LoCoBench by creating interactive environments from 8,000 scenarios, adding specialized tools and evaluation metrics across dimensions such as comprehension and efficiency.

Result: The evaluation revealed insights like robust long-context handling, a trade-off between comprehension and efficiency, and significant differences in tool usage strategies among models.

Conclusion: LoCoBench-Agent serves as a foundation to evaluate, compare, and enhance LLM agents in autonomous software development tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into sophisticated autonomous agents capable of complex software development tasks, evaluating their real-world capabilities becomes critical. While existing benchmarks like LoCoBench~\cite{qiu2025locobench} assess long-context code understanding, they focus on single-turn evaluation and cannot capture the multi-turn interactive nature, tool usage patterns, and adaptive reasoning required by real-world coding agents. We introduce \textbf{LoCoBench-Agent}, a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLM agents in realistic, long-context software engineering workflows. Our framework extends LoCoBench's 8,000 scenarios into interactive agent environments, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-turn conversations, tool usage efficiency, error recovery, and architectural consistency across extended development sessions. We also introduce an evaluation methodology with 9 metrics across comprehension and efficiency dimensions. Our framework provides agents with 8 specialized tools (file operations, search, code analysis) and evaluates them across context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, enabling precise assessment of long-context performance. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we reveal several key findings: (1) agents exhibit remarkable long-context robustness; (2) comprehension-efficiency trade-off exists with negative correlation, where thorough exploration increases comprehension but reduces efficiency; and (3) conversation efficiency varies dramatically across models, with strategic tool usage patterns differentiating high-performing agents. As the first long-context LLM agent benchmark for software engineering, LoCoBench-Agent establishes a rigorous foundation for measuring agent capabilities, identifying performance gaps, and advancing autonomous software development at scale.

TL;DR: FlakyGuard enhances large language models' capacity to repair flaky tests by using a graph-based method to provide precise context, outperforming prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies caused by flaky tests in industrial software projects, which waste resources and delay releases, by enhancing automated repair methods for these issues.

Method: The proposed solution, FlakyGuard, treats code as a graph structure, employing selective graph exploration to identify relevant context for better flaky test repair.

Result: FlakyGuard repaired 47.6% of reproducible flaky tests in industrial repositories, with a 51.8% developer acceptance rate of fixes, outperforming existing methods by more than 22%. Moreover, developer surveys highlighted its utility in explaining root causes of flaky tests.

Conclusion: FlakyGuard effectively addresses context issues in flaky test repair, demonstrating improved repair rates and developer satisfaction over previous approaches.

Abstract: Flaky tests that non-deterministically pass or fail waste developer time and slow release cycles. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.

### [356] [Keeping Code-Aware LLMs Fresh: Full Refresh, In-Context Deltas, and Incremental Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14022)
*Pradeep Kumar Sharma,Ishaan Puri,Mantinder Jit Singh,Swapnil Shivaprasad,Hritvik Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores strategies to keep code-snapshot mapping models fresh despite ongoing codebase evolution, utilizing three primary update strategies: retraining, in-context learning, and incremental fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Codebases evolve continuously, making models trained to map natural language queries to repository paths outdated and less effective. The paper aims to address how these models can retain accuracy and freshness over time across changing codebases.

Method: The study investigates three model update strategies: Full Refresh (retraining at new snapshots), In-Context Learning (injecting deltas at inference), and Incremental Fine-Tuning (carefully mixing old and new training data to mitigate forgetting).

Result: Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) with old-aware mixes achieves the best balance for accuracy across new and old code. In-Context Learning with English summaries provides quick updates when training isn't feasible, and Full Refresh assures maximum new-code accuracy. Comparisons show Git-diff excels in rename/delete situations, while full-file context works better for behavior changes.

Conclusion: Incremental Fine-Tuning is optimal for stable mixed-code accuracy, while other strategies suit specific needs such as fast updates or maximum new-code accuracy. The paper provides actionable insights for evolving code-repository models.

Abstract: Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.

### [357] [LogPurge: Log Data Purification for Anomaly Detection via Rule-Enhanced Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14062)
*Shenglin Zhang,Ziang Chen,Zijing Que,Yilun Liu,Yongqian Sun,Sicheng Wei,Dan Pei,Hailin Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework, LogPurge, for cost-effective and precise purification of log data, significantly improving log anomaly detection performance by leveraging large language models and rule enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current deep learning-based log anomaly detection methods require clean, anomaly-free data for effective training, which is costly and laborious to obtain manually. Existing automatic methods fail to account fully for the specific characteristics and semantics of logs.

Method: The proposed framework, LogPurge, integrates a two-stage filtering algorithm: (1) A large language model (LLM) removes clustered anomalous patterns and uses enhanced system rules for better understanding log semantics; (2) A divide-and-conquer strategy decomposes contaminated regions into smaller subproblems for iterative purification.

Result: LogPurge effectively removes 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples on average. It demonstrates significant F-1 score improvements of up to 149.72% on diverse public and private datasets compared to existing unsupervised algorithms.

Conclusion: The LogPurge framework successfully addresses challenges in log purification, enabling more accurate anomaly detection by combining LLMs and enhanced rule-based methodologies, and significantly surpasses existing methods in performance.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

*Malik Muhammad Umer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Development of Agile framework tailored for safety-critical aerospace software showcasing improved efficiency while adhering to DO-178C compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address demands for agility, strict safety, and compliance in aerospace software development.

Method: Customized Scrum framework with adaptations for safety-critical software and comparative project evaluation.

Result: Improved development efficiency: reduced effort, faster defect handling, lower defect density, and compliance adherence.

Conclusion: Agile practices enhance efficiency while meeting aerospace safety standards, with potential for further automation and industry-wide application.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of aerospace systems requires development processes that balance agility with stringent safety and certification demands. This study presents an empirically validated Scrum-based Agile framework tailored for DO-178C compliant, safety-critical aerospace software. The framework adapts core Scrum roles, artifacts, and events to meet certification, verification, and independence objectives. Key enhancements include a multi-disciplinary product ownership model, dual compliance-and-functionality acceptance criteria, independent testing and documentation teams, and dedicated certification liaisons. The approach was evaluated through two comparable aerospace projects-one using the customized Agile process and the other a traditional Waterfall model. Results showed significant improvements: a 76% reduction in Total Effort per Requirement, 75% faster Defect Detection, 78% faster Defect Resolution, and over 50% lower Defect Density, while maintaining full compliance with DO-178C Design Assurance Level A. These findings demonstrate that Agile practices and regulatory compliance can coexist effectively when supported by disciplined tailoring and proactive engagement with certification authorities. The study also notes challenges, including increased V&V effort due to recurring Sprint activities and refactoring inherent to iterative development. Nonetheless, it identifies substantial opportunities for further gains through workflow automation, CI/CD practices, and automated documentation, verification, and configuration management. Future research should expand validation of this framework across the aerospace domain and other safety-critical industries with similar certification requirements.

TL;DR: KTester enhances LLM-based unit test generation for improved correctness and maintainability using project and testing domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in generating correct and maintainable automated unit tests with LLMs by leveraging project-specific and testing domain knowledge.

Method: KTester extracts project structure/usage knowledge through static analysis, separates test case design and method generation using domain-guided strategies, and employs multi-perspective prompting and structured templates.

Result: KTester outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines in correctness, coverage, readability, and maintainability metrics, with execution pass rate improvement of 5.69% and line coverage improvement of 8.83%.

Conclusion: KTester demonstrates a knowledge-driven framework significantly enhances practical testing quality with higher correctness and maintainability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Automated unit test generation using large language models (LLMs) holds great promise but often struggles with generating tests that are both correct and maintainable in real-world projects. This paper presents KTester, a novel framework that integrates project-specific knowledge and testing domain knowledge to enhance LLM-based test generation. Our approach first extracts project structure and usage knowledge through static analysis, which provides rich context for the model. It then employs a testing-domain-knowledge-guided separation of test case design and test method generation, combined with a multi-perspective prompting strategy that guides the LLM to consider diverse testing heuristics. The generated tests follow structured templates, improving clarity and maintainability. We evaluate KTester on multiple open-source projects, comparing it against state-of-the-art LLM-based baselines using automatic correctness and coverage metrics, as well as a human study assessing readability and maintainability. Results demonstrate that KTester significantly outperforms existing methods across six key metrics, improving execution pass rate by 5.69% and line coverage by 8.83% over the strongest baseline, while requiring less time and generating fewer test cases. Human evaluators also rate the tests produced by KTester significantly higher in terms of correctness, readability, and maintainability, confirming the practical advantages of our knowledge-driven framework.

*Dulaji Hidellaarachchi,Sebastian Baltes,John Grundy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores how cognitive capability and personality traits impact software problem solving. Results showed that reasoning accuracy and traits like conscientiousness and openness were linked to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the effects of cognitive ability and personality on software problem solving, aiming to improve educational and professional approaches.

Method: 80 participants (40 practitioners, 40 students) completed reasoning tests (Baddeley's test, IPIP NEO 50) and nine interview-style problem-solving tasks. Analyses examined relationships between traits, cognitive ability, and performance.

Result: Practitioners performed slightly better overall. Reasoning accuracy positively correlated with task performance. Conscientiousness and openness traits aided problem solving, while neuroticism negatively impacted outcomes.

Conclusion: Improving reasoning skills and considering personality traits can enhance software problem solving. Practical applications include curriculum adjustments and better role assignments in industry, with recommendations for further research.

Abstract: Software engineering is a deeply cognitive activity shaped by individual differences that extend beyond technical skill. This study investigates how cognitive capability and personality traits jointly relate to software problem solving among 80 participants (40 software practitioners, 40 software engineering students). Cognitive capability was measured using Baddeleys three minute grammatical reasoning test, while personality was assessed using the IPIP NEO 50 test. Participants further completed nine interview style problem solving questions. Six questions were related to coding and three were related to logical reasoning. Descriptive and correlational analyses show that practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy and overall task performance than students. Grammatical-reasoning accuracy correlated positively with problem solving performance, indicating that stronger cognitive capability is associated with better performance in coding and logical tasks. Personality performance links were systematic. We identified that the conscientiousness trait correlated most strongly with problem solving and with reasoning accuracy, while the openness to experience trait was positively related to both outcomes. Neuroticism showed small, negative associations with accuracy and performance. Taken together, our results suggest that conscientiousness and openness to experience characteristics complement reasoning accuracy to support software problem solving, whereas elevated negative affect may hinder precision under time pressure. Our findings suggest practical implications for education and industry such as integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering personality cognition in recruitment and role allocation. We highlight directions for future research such as longitudinal and task diverse replications with larger samples.

TL;DR: The paper explores a vision for integrating Runtime Verification (RV) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safety and trust in autonomous systems, especially those involving learning components and dynamic environments, which current methods struggle to fully address.

Method: Proposes combining RV for runtime monitoring/anticipation with LLMs to enhance specification understanding, anticipatory reasoning, and uncertainty handling.

Result: Conceptually outlines how RV and LLMs could reinforce each other, distinguishing this vision from existing approaches.

Conclusion: Combining RV and LLMs holds potential for advancing dependable autonomous systems, though challenges in certification and future research directions must be addressed.

Abstract: Assuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems is particularly difficult when learning-enabled components and open environments are involved. Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.

[Results] Participants recognized potential efficiency and scalability gains, but highlighted risks related to bias, contextual loss, reproducibility, and the rapid evolution of LLMs. They also emphasized the need for prompting literacy and continuous human oversight. [Conclusion] Findings portray LLMs as tools that can support, but not substitute, interpretive analysis. The study contributes to ongoing community reflections on how LLMs can responsibly enhance qualitative research in SE.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the interoperability challenges between openEHR and HL7 FHIR caused by differing data modeling approaches and lack of transformation standards.

Method: The authors propose FHIRconnect, which uses a triple-layered architecture and introduces a domain-specific language, an open-source transformation engine, and a reusable mapping library.

Result: FHIRconnect achieves 65% mapping reuse across projects and maps 24 international archetypes to 15 FHIR profiles across seven clinical domains.

Conclusion: FHIRconnect reduces dependency on custom ETL solutions and enhances syntactic and semantic interoperability in healthcare IT systems, fostering community-driven mapping standardization.

Abstract: Healthcare interoperability between openEHR and HL7 FHIR remains challenging due to fundamental differences in their data modeling approaches and the absence of standardized transformation mechanisms. This paper presents FHIRconnect, a novel domain-specific language and open-source transformation engine that enables standardized, bidirectional data exchange between openEHR and FHIR. Our approach addresses critical interoperability gaps through a triple-layered architecture that achieves 65% mapping reuse across projects by leveraging international archetype-based foundations while supporting local customizations. Using this framework, FHIRconnect successfully mapped 24 international archetypes to 15 FHIR profiles across seven clinical domains. Key contributions include the first comprehensive DSL for openEHR-FHIR transformation with a formal specification, an open-source execution engine (openFHIR), and an accessible mapping library covering high-impact clinical archetypes. Together, these components establish the technical basis for community-driven mapping standardization, reducing reliance on custom ETL solutions and advancing syntactic and semantic interoperability in healthcare IT systems built on open standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the interplay of motivations and challenges that influence software engineering students and professionals across their transition from education to the workplace.

Method: The study conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using the Gioia Methodology, a grounded theory methodology, to develop taxonomies of motivations and challenges. It further proposed the EPE Process Model based on the findings.

Result: The findings highlight how impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure relies on extrinsic factors. The study identifies significant challenges persisting across education and careers, such as barriers to belonging and career progression difficulties.

Conclusion: The research provides a theoretical framework to better design SE education and professional interventions by strengthening intrinsic motivations and reducing systemic barriers, thereby addressing persistence and career satisfaction challenges.

Abstract: Motivations and challenges jointly shape how individuals enter, persist, and evolve within software engineering (SE), yet their interplay remains underexplored across the transition from education to professional practice. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews and employed the Gioia Methodology, an adapted grounded theory methodology from organizational behavior, to inductively derive taxonomies of motivations and challenges, and build the Exposure-Pursuit-Evaluation (EPE) Process Model. Our findings reveal that impactful early exposure triggers intrinsic motivations, while non-impactful exposure requires an extrinsic push (e.g., career/ personal goals, external validation). We identify curiosity and avoiding alternatives as a distinct educational drivers, and barriers to belonging as the only challenge persisting across education and career. Our findings show that career progression challenges (e.g., navigating the corporate world) constrain extrinsic fulfillment while technical training challenges, barriers to belonging and threats to motivation constrain intrinsic fulfillment. The theory shows how unmet motivations and recurring challenges influence persistence, career shifts, or departure from the field. Our results provide a grounded model for designing interventions that strengthen intrinsic fulfillment and reduce systemic barriers in SE education and practice.

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-based workflow utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the translation and optimization of legacy Fortran codes to Kokkos C++ for performance portability across diverse hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy Fortran codebases, still prevalent in scientific applications, struggle with modern GPU-accelerated platforms due to the lack of native Fortran bindings. There is an urgent need to make these codes portable and efficient on heterogeneous architectures.

Method: The method involves an agentic AI workflow utilizing specialized LLMs to perform tasks like translating, validating, debugging, optimizing, and running Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs.

Result: The workflow successfully transformed a variety of benchmark kernels, generating Kokkos codes that outperformed the original Fortran baselines across diverse hardware. OpenAI models like GPT-5 were effective, while open-source models struggled.

Conclusion: Agentic AI workflows show promise for autonomously modernizing legacy Fortran applications to portable, high-performance standards, highlighting the potential of LLMs in domain-specific scientific applications.

Abstract: Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electroencephalogram-based imagined speech decoding suffers from high variability in neural activity patterns, challenging cross-individual generalization.

Method: The paper proposes a cyclic inter-subject training scheme with frequent alternations, and a subject-calibrated leave-one-subject-out approach using small proportions of target subject data for adaptation.

Result: With 10% calibration data from the target subject, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.781 and AUC of 0.801, showcasing effective few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: Combining cyclic training with minimal calibration appears effective for scalable, user-adaptive brain-computer interfaces prioritizing generalization and personalization.

Abstract: Achieving robust generalization across individuals remains a major challenge in electroencephalogram based imagined speech decoding due to substantial variability in neural activity patterns. This study examined how training dynamics and lightweight subject specific adaptation influence cross subject performance in a neural decoding framework. A cyclic inter subject training approach, involving shorter per subject training segments and frequent alternation among subjects, led to modest yet consistent improvements in decoding performance across unseen target data. Furthermore, under the subject calibrated leave one subject out scheme, incorporating only 10 % of the target subjects data for calibration achieved an accuracy of 0.781 and an AUC of 0.801, demonstrating the effectiveness of few shot adaptation. These findings suggest that integrating cyclic training with minimal calibration provides a simple and effective strategy for developing scalable, user adaptive brain computer interface systems that balance generalization and personalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a novel approach to improve interpretability in low-rank RNNs by encouraging disentanglement of latent dynamics while maintaining computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) reveal low-dimensional neural population activity dynamics but lack interpretability and the ability to assign distinct roles to latent dimensions.

Method: The authors propose DisRNN, a generative lrRNN framework within a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. They introduce a partial correlation penalty to enforce disentanglement among groups of latent dimensions while allowing within-group flexibility.

Result: DisRNN outperforms standard lrRNNs by improving disentanglement and interpretability of latent neural trajectories across experiments with synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data.

Conclusion: DisRNN enhances the interpretability of neural population activity by enabling better disentanglement of latent groups, showcasing its utility in neural activity modeling.

Abstract: Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) are a class of models that uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying neural population activity. Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.

*Nilay Kumar,Priyansh Bhandari,G. Maragatham*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The authors propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based model for emotion recognition using EEG signals, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion recognition using EEG signals often neglects the dynamic interplay between brain regions, limiting their accuracy.

Method: RBTransformer transforms EEG signals into Band Differential Entropy tokens, incorporates spatial information through Electrode Identity embeddings, and applies multi-head attention blocks for inter-cortical dependencies.

Result: RBTransformer achieved superior performance across SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets in subject-dependent settings for both binary and multi-class classification of Valence, Arousal, and Dominance.

Conclusion: RBTransformer effectively captures neural interactions and improves EEG-based emotion recognition, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

*Felipe A. Torres,Alejandro Weinstein,Jesus M. Cortes,Wael El-Deredy*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study reveals that network resonance in the brain scales with size due to propagation delays, providing a generalized analytical model validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the physical mechanism behind the size-dependent resonance frequencies observed in neural networks of different sizes.

Method: A Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays was analyzed analytically through linearization, producing predictions validated by numerical simulations across various geometric and delay configurations.

Result: The analysis derived a scaling law indicating delay-limited resonance dependent on network size. Simulations confirmed predictions, showing resonance systematically tied to network geometry and delay dispersion effects quantified.

Conclusion: The findings provide a universal analytical framework explaining size-dependent cortical resonance, linking it to propagation delays, and reconciling previous theoretical and empirical observations.

Abstract: The collective frequency that emerges from synchronized neuronal populations--the network resonance--shows a systematic relationship with brain size: whole-brain's large networks oscillate slowly, whereas finer parcellations of fixed volume exhibit faster rhythms. This resonance-size scaling has been reported in delayed neural mass models and human neuroimaging, yet the physical mechanism remained unresolved. Here we show that size-dependent resonance follows directly from propagation delays in delay-coupled phase oscillators. Starting from a Kuramoto model with heterogeneous delays, we linearize around the near-synchronous solution and obtain a closed-form approximation linking the resonance $Ω$ to the mean delay and the effective coupling field. The analysis predicts a generic scaling law: $Ω\approx (\sum_j c_{ij} τ)^{-1}$, so resonance is delay-limited and therefore depends systematically on geometric size or parcellation density. We evaluate four growth scenarios--expanding geometry, fixed-volume parcellation, constant geometry, and an unphysical reference case--and show that only geometry-consistent scaling satisfies the analytical prediction. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous delays validate the law and quantify its error as a function of delay dispersion. These results identify a minimal physical mechanism for size-dependent cortical resonance and provide an analytical framework that unifies numeric simulation outputs.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study identifies right inferior insula dysfunction as a key factor in long COVID-related brain fog and demonstrates that targeted neuromodulation can improve this cognitive impairment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying neural mechanisms contributing to long COVID 'brain fog' and explore potential therapeutic interventions.

Method: The study involved 120 long COVID patients, utilizing EEG and structural MRI analyses to detect brain dysfunction, and confirmed findings via a longitudinal cohort study with the UK Biobank. A randomized trial using theta-burst ultrasound stimulation further tested therapeutic effects.

Result: Patients with brain fog exhibited distinctive perceptual processing deficits linked to right inferior insula dysfunction, evidenced by false alarms, blunted neural signals, and cortical atrophy. Modulation of this region via ultrasound stimulation improved perceptual deficits.

Conclusion: The right inferior insula's dysfunction causally contributes to long COVID-related cognitive impairment, and targeting this region with neuromodulation presents a novel therapeutic approach.

Abstract: Long COVID "brain fog" is a common and debilitating subjective syndrome often associated with persistent cognitive impairment after COVID-19 infection. Here we identify a specific regional brain dysfunction that mediates this cognitive impairment and provide evidence that targeted neuromodulation improves this deficit. In 120 patients with long COVID brain fog, we found an aberrant perceptual processing pattern. Patients with more severe brain fog committed significantly more false alarms (impulsive responses to non-signals) despite preserved overall accuracy. Both high-density (128-channel) EEG and structural MRI analyses provided converging evidence of a right inferior insula deficit, characterized by a blunted neural monitoring signal and cortical atrophy. We confirmed this deficit in a separate 796-participant UK Biobank longitudinal COVID re-imaging cohort, where COVID-19 survivors also showed selective impairment on a perceptual processing task and corresponding longitudinal atrophy of the right inferior insula compared with healthy controls. Finally, in a proof-of-principle randomized, sham-controlled trial (n = 40), a non-invasive, excitatory theta-burst ultrasound stimulation protocol targeting the right inferior insula rescued the perceptual deficit by reducing false alarms. These findings provide evidence of a causal role for right inferior insula dysfunction in long COVID-related perceptual impairment and show that modulation of this region can rescue the deficit, establishing it as a novel therapeutic target for long COVID cognitive impairment.

### [371] [Multi-network Topology Underlying Individual Language Learning Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14453)
*Peilun Song,Shuguang Yang,Xiujuan Geng,Zhenzhong Gan,Suiping Wang,Gangyi Feng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the individual differences in adult language learning through intrinsic multimodal brain network connectivities using graph-theory-based metrics, providing insights into general and task-specific learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover why variability in adult language learning arises and how it connects to specific brain network topologies using advanced graph-based network analyses.

Method: Using multimodal imaging (resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging) from 101 adults, combined with seven days of artificial language training tasks, the researchers tested predictive models based on graph-theoretic metrics.

Result: The study successfully predicted learning outcomes and rates using brain network measures, identifying significant roles for dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and default mode networks. Specific network metrics like local efficiency and betweenness centrality contributed notably.

Conclusion: Language learning success is shaped by intrinsic network topologies of distributed brain networks, advocating a multiple-systems interaction model and aiding personalized language education strategies.

Abstract: Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education.

*Hadi Barati,Ali Nayerifar,Mehdi Fardmanesh*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines dopamine's role in the CSTC loop, finding it can enhance or diminish SNR depending on the brain region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nuanced role of dopamine in regulating movement and signal processing in neural circuits.

Method: Simulated the effects of dopamine on the CSTC loop and analyzed its impact on signal-to-noise ratio across specific brain regions.

Result: Dopamine's impact on SNR is region-specific: increasing in some areas (e.g., D2 Striatum) and decreasing in others (e.g., Thalamus VL), based on neuronal excitability and noise.

Conclusion: Dopamine modulates rather than universally enhances neural signals, maintaining a balance between movement facilitation and noise in the CSTC loop.

Abstract: In this work, the effects of dopamine neurotransmitter within the Cortico-Striatal-Thalamo-Cortical (CSTC) loop. Simulations confirmed dopamine facilitates movement via thalamic disinhibition. Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop.

TL;DR: DecNefLab offers a simulation framework optimizing Decoded Neurofeedback research, addressing key challenges and enhancing understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in DecNef research include subject variability, reliance on indirect progress measures, and high experimental costs.

Method: The study introduces DecNefLab, a simulation framework using latent variable generative models to analyze neurofeedback dynamics.

Result: DecNefLab reproduces DecNef phenomena, identifies failure conditions, and improves protocol design prior to human application.

Conclusion: By integrating computational modeling, DecNefLab advances methodological innovation and understanding in brain modulation research.

Abstract: Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is a flourishing non-invasive approach to brain modulation with wide-ranging applications in neuromedicine and cognitive neuroscience. However, progress in DecNef research remains constrained by subject-dependent learning variability, reliance on indirect measures to quantify progress, and the high cost and time demands of experimentation.
  We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.
  We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.
  In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.

*Anthony Kiggundu,Bin Han,Hans D. Schotten*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies the dual M/M/1 queue system and the impact of two information models: a Markov estimator and an actor-critic method, on reneging and jockeying behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how different information feeds impact the performance of a queue system, particularly in terms of delays, reneging rates, jockeying behavior, and their asymptotic limits.

Method: The authors use analytical techniques to examine queue behaviors under unequal service rates and validate theoretical limits through empirical experiments comparing differences in finite backlog systems.

Result: The study finds that learned and analytic information feeds yield different behaviors at practical finite queue sizes but converge to the same limits in asymptotic conditions.

Conclusion: The paper identifies scenarios where the information models matter in finite queue sizes but lose significance at asymptotic levels, offering insights for designing lightweight, jockeying-aware systems.

Abstract: We study how two information feeds, a closed-form Markov estimator of residual sojourn and an online trained actor-critic, affect reneging and jockeying in a dual M/M/1 system. Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness). We empirically validate these limits and quantify finite backlog differences. Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory. The results characterize when value-of-information matters (finite regimes) and when it does not (asymptotics), informing lightweight telemetry and decision-logic design for low-cost, jockeying-aware systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high-stakes risks such as misdiagnosis due to uncertainty in predicting biomarker trajectories, thereby facilitating safer clinical deployment.

Method: The authors extend conformal prediction to randomly-timed biomarker trajectories using a novel nonconformity score, ensuring user-prescribed coverage probabilities. They also propose group-conditional conformal bands for heterogeneous populations.

Result: The method achieves consistent coverage with tighter prediction bands across various predictors and subpopulations. It improves the identification of high-risk subjects for Alzheimer's progression by 17.5% more than standard scores.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-calibrated prediction bands and risk scores significantly enhance clinical decision-making reliability and safety, demonstrating practical benefits in Alzheimer’s disease risk identification.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in predicting biomarker trajectories from real clinical data, uncertainty in the predictions poses high-stakes risks (e.g., misdiagnosis) that limit their clinical deployment. To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an empirical likelihood (EL) framework for random forests to enhance statistical uncertainty quantification and adjust for sparsity-related challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve uncertainty quantification for random forests by harnessing their inherent statistical structure, addressing existing limitations in coverage accuracy.

Method: The paper constructs an EL statistic from the incomplete U-statistic structure in ensemble methods and proposes a modified EL adjustment to restore pivotality under sparse subsampling regimes.

Result: The modified EL achieves accurate coverage and outperforms existing inference methods, as demonstrated through theoretical analysis and simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed EL and its adjustment are computationally efficient and offer a robust approach for reliable statistical inference in random forests.

Abstract: We develop an empirical likelihood (EL) framework for random forests and related ensemble methods, providing a likelihood-based approach to quantify their statistical uncertainty. Exploiting the incomplete $U$-statistic structure inherent in ensemble predictions, we construct an EL statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared when subsampling induced by incompleteness is not overly sparse. Under sparser subsampling regimes, the EL statistic tends to over-cover due to loss of pivotality; we therefore propose a modified EL that restores pivotality through a simple adjustment. Our method retains key properties of EL while remaining computationally efficient. Theory for honest random forests and simulations demonstrate that modified EL achieves accurate coverage and practical reliability relative to existing inference methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified and expressive framework for function approximation, leveraging local adjustment capabilities for greater control and efficiency.

Method: Model outputs are constructed as mixtures of heterogeneous splats with adjustable scale/direction. Optimization uses Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows.

Result: Unified theoretical framework includes Gaussian Splatting as a case and demonstrates flexibility in addressing approximation and inverse problems.

Conclusion: Splat Regression Models offer a promising approach for various approximation and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data, balancing accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive class of function approximators called Splat Regression Models. Model outputs are mixtures of heterogeneous and anisotropic bump functions, termed splats, each weighted by an output vector. The power of splat modeling lies in its ability to locally adjust the scale and direction of each splat, achieving both high interpretability and accuracy. Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting models and algorithms constitute a flexible and promising approach for solving diverse approximation, estimation, and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data.

*Renjie Chen,Viet Anh Nguyen,Huifu Xu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust method for simultaneously estimating covariance and precision matrices, reducing bias and improving estimation quality through a specialized shrinkage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spectral bias and challenges in simultaneously estimating covariance and precision matrices under uncertain distributions.

Method: The method involves minimizing the worst-case weighted sum of losses using an ambiguity set, resulting in a convex optimization problem leading to the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE).

Result: The proposed shrinkage estimators improve spectral bias correction, estimator condition number, and perform competitively on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: SCOPE is a robust estimation approach with a shrinkage mechanism that enhances covariance and precision matrix estimation performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art estimators.

Abstract: We propose a distributionally robust formulation for simultaneously estimating the covariance matrix and the precision matrix of a random vector.The proposed model minimizes the worst-case weighted sum of the Frobenius loss of the covariance estimator and Stein's loss of the precision matrix estimator against all distributions from an ambiguity set centered at the nominal distribution. The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for aggregating directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in causal discovery, addressing limitations in traditional methods by considering higher-order structures for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the aggregation process of causal discovery by addressing the limitations of traditional methods which only consider individual edges, ignoring complex higher-order edge structures.

Method: Introduced a novel theoretical framework focusing on higher-order structures and proposed a new DAG aggregation algorithm.

Result: The proposed approach proved computationally efficient and effective, outperforming existing methods, especially under conditions of limited data and high dimensionality.

Conclusion: The new framework and algorithm enhance the process of causal discovery, making it more robust and precise, particularly in challenging scenarios like low sample sizes or high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Causal discovery combines data with knowledge provided by experts to learn the DAG representing the causal relationships between a given set of variables. When data are scarce, bagging is used to measure our confidence in an average DAG obtained by aggregating bootstrapped DAGs. However, the aggregation step has received little attention from the specialized literature: the average DAG is constructed using only the confidence in the individual edges of the bootstrapped DAGs, thus disregarding complex higher-order edge structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework based on higher-order structures and describe a new DAG aggregation algorithm. We perform a simulation study, discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Our proposal is both computationally efficient and effective, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions, especially in low sample size regimes and under high dimensionality settings.

### [380] [Skewness-Robust Causal Discovery in Location-Scale Noise Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14441)
*Daniel Klippert,Alexander Marx*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkewD, a novel algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under location-scale noise models (LSNMs) with skewed noise distributions, overcoming limitations of methods assuming symmetric noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods struggle to identify cause-effect relationships in bivariate models when noise distributions are skewed, which occurs frequently in real-world data.

Method: The authors propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm that extends causal discovery under LSNMs to handle skewed noise distributions using a skew-normal framework with heuristic search and expectation conditional maximization for parameter estimation.

Result: SkewD is evaluated on synthetic and benchmark datasets, demonstrating robust performance and reliability under high skewness, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: SkewD effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods in handling skewed noise, offering a flexible and robust solution for causal discovery in practical scenarios.

Abstract: To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \to Y$ and $Y \to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepBlip, a neural framework for structural nested mean models (SNMMs) that addresses shortcomings in sequential g-estimation schemes through a novel optimization technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the need to estimate treatment effects over time in an interpretable, efficient, and unbiased manner while leveraging neural network capabilities to handle complex temporal dependencies.

Method: DeepBlip integrates sequential models like LSTMs or transformers to learn all blip functions simultaneously via a double optimization trick, ensuring unbiased estimates with a robust Neyman-orthogonal loss.

Result: DeepBlip showcases superior performance across clinical datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in adjusting for time-varying confounding and estimating treatment effects.

Conclusion: DeepBlip enables practical, efficient evaluation of treatment policies using neural networks, advancing the application of SNMMs in time-dependent treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) are a principled approach to estimate the treatment effects over time. A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification. Finally, we evaluate our DeepBlip across various clinical datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address global convergence in neural networks for the two-stage least squares approach in nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), where standard optimization techniques face challenges.

Method: The study uses a lifted perspective of mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) for bilevel optimization and introduces the penalty gradient framework to propose the F^2BMLD algorithm.

Result: The paper achieves global convergence and provides a generalization bound in the optimization-statistics trade-off. The method is validated on an offline reinforcement learning benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method establishes a significant advancement in dealing with NPIV problems using neural networks while balancing optimization and statistical guarantees.

Abstract: We establish the first global convergence result of neural networks for two stage least squares (2SLS) approach in nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV). This is achieved by adopting a lifted perspective through mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), unlike standard MFLD, however, our setting of 2SLS entails a \emph{bilevel} optimization problem in the space of probability measures. To address this challenge, we leverage the penalty gradient approach recently developed for bilevel optimization which formulates bilevel optimization as a Lagrangian problem. This leads to a novel fully first-order algorithm, termed \texttt{F$^2$BMLD}. Apart from the convergence bound, we further provide a generalization bound, revealing an inherent trade-off in the choice of the Lagrange multiplier between optimization and statistical guarantees. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on an offline reinforcement learning benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroPath, an enhanced RAG framework inspired by neurobiology, which significantly improves multi-hop question answering. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recall accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop question answering remains challenging for naive RAG methods due to their inability to capture complex dependencies across documents. Existing graph-based approaches introduce noise and lose semantic coherence.

Method: The proposed method, NeuroPath, employs Dynamic Path Tracking for semantic pruning in a knowledge graph and Post-retrieval Completion to refine query goals and address missing information.

Result: NeuroPath achieves 16.3% improvement in recall@2 and 13.5% in recall@5 compared to advanced graph-based RAG methods, while increasing accuracy and reducing token consumption by 22.8%.

Conclusion: NeuroPath surpasses current methods in multi-hop QA performance, demonstrates robustness across smaller LLMs, and validates scalability across tasks. It represents a significant advancement in RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LGSID, a framework for enhancing local-life recommendation using geographic item tokenization aligned with large language models, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based methods for item recommendation struggle with fine-grained spatial and real-world distance relationships, particularly in local-life services.

Method: The proposed framework includes RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment for spatial relationship modeling and Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization for capturing geographic attributes.

Result: Experiments on Kuaishou datasets demonstrate that LGSID surpasses state-of-the-art recommendation models in performance.

Conclusion: LGSID effectively incorporates spatial and semantic knowledge into recommendation systems, demonstrating robust improvements in domain-specific tasks like local-life services.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness.

*Daniël Wilten,Gideon Maillette de Buy Wenniger,Arjen Hommersom,Paul Lucassen,Emiel Poortman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the use of multiple carousels for organizing recommendations on platforms, focusing on increasing diversity in book recommendations using collaborative filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance recommendation systems in public library web catalogs by increasing diversity, which is crucial for user engagement.

Method: Several strategies to improve diversity within book recommendations were developed and evaluated using new metrics, based on collaborative filtering algorithms.

Result: The proposed strategies successfully balance recommendation accuracy with increased diversity.

Conclusion: The system achieved a satisfactory compromise between accuracy and diversity, enhancing user engagement and recommendation quality.

Abstract: Using multiple carousels, lists that wrap around and can be scrolled, is the basis for offering content in most contemporary movie streaming platforms. Carousels allow for highlighting different aspects of users' taste, that fall in categories such as genres and authors. However, while carousels offer structure and greater ease of navigation, they alone do not increase diversity in recommendations, while this is essential to keep users engaged. In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm. These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects.

### [386] [Preference-Based Learning in Audio Applications: A Systematic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13936)
*Aaron Broukhim,Yiran Shen,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu,Nadir Weibel*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Preference learning for generative models is underexplored in audio domains. Most studies transitioned post-2021 to focus on generation tasks with modern RLHF frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the application of preference learning in audio domains and improve practices for subjective audio tasks like naturalness and musicality.

Method: A systematic PRISMA-guided review analyzed about 500 papers, identifying historical trends and emerging themes in applying preference learning to audio.

Result: 30 papers applied preference learning in audio, revealing shifts from emotion recognition with rankSVM (pre-2021) to RLHF-driven generation tasks (post-2021). Key patterns like multi-dimensional evaluation and inconsistent traditional metrics were noted.

Conclusion: Preference learning has potential for audio tasks but needs standardized benchmarks, better datasets, and exploration of temporal factors specific to audio.

Abstract: Despite the parallel challenges that audio and text domains face in evaluating generative model outputs, preference learning remains remarkably underexplored in audio applications. Through a PRISMA-guided systematic review of approximately 500 papers, we find that only 30 (6%) apply preference learning to audio tasks. Our analysis reveals a field in transition: pre-2021 works focused on emotion recognition using traditional ranking methods (rankSVM), while post-2021 studies have pivoted toward generation tasks employing modern RLHF frameworks. We identify three critical patterns: (1) the emergence of multi-dimensional evaluation strategies combining synthetic, automated, and human preferences; (2) inconsistent alignment between traditional metrics (WER, PESQ) and human judgments across different contexts; and (3) convergence on multi-stage training pipelines that combine reward signals. Our findings suggest that while preference learning shows promise for audio, particularly in capturing subjective qualities like naturalness and musicality, the field requires standardized benchmarks, higher-quality datasets, and systematic investigation of how temporal factors unique to audio impact preference learning frameworks.

### [387] [Count The Notes: Histogram-Based Supervision for Automatic Music Transcription](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14250)
*Jonathan Yaffe,Ben Maman,Meinard Müller,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CountEM introduces a new Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) framework, reducing annotation efforts and improving transcription accuracy by leveraging note event histograms instead of precise local alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating precise frame-level annotation datasets for AMT is costly and impractical, leading to an exploration of weaker, segment-level aligned approaches.

Method: CountEM uses note event histograms as supervision without explicit local alignment, employing an Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to refine predictions iteratively based on note occurrence counts.

Result: CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods in transcription accuracy across piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets, demonstrating improved robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: CountEM enhances AMT by eliminating the need for explicit local alignment, making the process more efficient, scalable, and accessible while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) converts audio recordings into symbolic musical representations. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

*Marcel Gibier,Raphaël Duroselle,Pierre Serrano,Olivier Boeffard,Jean-François Bonastre*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores token pruning strategies for audio-language models to reduce computation costs while keeping competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of high computational costs in audio-language models caused by long audio input sequences.

Method: The authors adapt token pruning methods from vision-language models and propose a lightweight approach that considers the time dimension specifically for audio-language data.

Result: The proposed method retains only a quarter of the original tokens, achieving minimal performance decreases of 2% in CIDEr scores on Clotho v2 and 4% in accuracy on MMAU.

Conclusion: Token pruning strategies can significantly reduce computation costs of audio-language models with minimal impacts on their performance.

Abstract: Recent audio-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of audio tasks and are increasingly capable of handling long audio inputs. However, the computing costs in these models heavily depend on sequence length, which can become very large given the nature of audio data. In the vision-language domain, token pruning methods have proven effective in reducing token counts while preserving strong performance on standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate the relevance and effectiveness of such token selection strategies in the context of audio-language models. We also improve them by proposing a lightweight strategy that takes the time dimension into account. While retaining only a quarter of the initial tokens, our approach results in a relative maximum decrease of 2% in CIDEr on Clotho v2 and a relative maximum decrease of 4% in accuracy on MMAU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and explore innovative approaches for Audio Question Answering by integrating acoustic event features and instruction-tuned language models.

Method: The method integrates SSL backbone BEATs for audio feature extraction and classification, followed by calibration and structured prompt creation. It combines these predictions with a language model fine-tuned using the GRPO algorithm.

Result: The proposed system achieved a 62.6% accuracy on the DCASE 2025 Challenge development set.

Conclusion: Combining acoustic event reasoning via BEATs and instruction-tuned LLMs effectively improves Audio Question Answering accuracy.

Abstract: In this report, we describe our submission to Track 5 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge for the task of Audio Question Answering(AQA). Our system leverages the SSL backbone BEATs to extract frame-level audio features, which are then processed by a classification head to generate segment-level predictions of acoustic events, following the Audioset ontology. These segment-level predictions are subsequently calibrated before producing event-level predictions. Finally, these predictions are incorporated into a structured prompt, along with the question and candidate answers. This prompt is then fed to a fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, trained using the GRPO algorithm with a simple reward function. Our method achieves an accuracy of 62.6 % on the development set, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining acoustic event reasoning with instruction-tuned large language models for AQA.

*Xinxin Tang,Bin Qin,Yufang Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents IMSE, a lightweight network for speech enhancement that reduces computational complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of balancing lightweight design and high performance in speech enhancement tasks on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes IMSE with two innovations: Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA) and Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv) for efficient global modeling and feature extraction.

Result: IMSE reduces the parameter count by 16.8%, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on the PESQ metric.

Conclusion: IMSE demonstrates a new standard for balancing model size and speech quality in resource-efficient speech enhancement applications.

Abstract: Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a significant challenge for speech enhancement (SE) tasks on resource-constrained devices. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex "approximate-compensate" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the "amplitude-ignoring" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373). This study sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement.

Motivation: To optimize storage and query performance in data warehouses and time-series through better datetime representation.

Method: Proposes replacing DATE and TIMESTAMP types with integer-based datetime labels, alongside advanced algorithms for indexing, aggregation, and batching.

Result: Achieves a 30-60% reduction in storage, 25-40% faster query execution, and an eightfold throughput increase.

Conclusion: Integer-based datetime labels improve both resource efficiency and query performance across varied domains like finance, IoT, and scientific research.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to examine and demonstrate how integer-based datetime labels (integer surrogate keys for time) can optimize data-warehouse and time-series performance, proposing practical formats and algorithms and validating their efficiency on real-world workloads. It is shown that replacing standard DATE and TIMESTAMP types with 32- and 64-bit integer formats reduces storage requirements by 30-60 percent and speeds up query execution by 25-40 percent. The paper presents indexing, aggregation, compression, and batching algorithms demonstrating up to an eightfold increase in throughput. Practical examples from finance, telecommunications, IoT, and scientific research confirm the efficiency and versatility of the proposed approach.

### [392] [Gradient-Based Join Ordering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14482)
*Tim Schwabe,Maribel Acosta*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for optimizing join ordering in database queries using gradient-based search techniques enabled by continuous relaxation and differentiable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing join ordering in database queries is crucial for performance, but traditional methods suffer from inefficiency and poor scalability.

Method: The authors use continuous relaxation of query plans, a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization, and differentiable constraints along with a Graph Neural Network-based cost model for gradient-based optimization.

Result: Compared to classical methods, this approach produced similar or better-cost query plans while scaling linearly with query size, unlike traditional approaches that scale quadratically or exponentially.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient-based optimization demonstrates significant potential for scalable and effective query optimization, paving the way for novel techniques in query optimizers.

Abstract: Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper presents Safe-ROS, an architecture ensuring safety and reliability for autonomous robots in critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring both operational effectiveness and safety compliance is crucial for deploying robots in critical applications.

Method: Developed Safe-ROS featuring an intelligent control system and a Safety System based on Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs); demonstrated via inspection tasks in nuclear environments.

Result: The architecture successfully integrates, verifies, and validates safety requirements under realistic conditions.

Conclusion: Safe-ROS offers a robust, extendable framework for deploying safety-compliant autonomous robots.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains requires architectures that ensure operational effectiveness and safety compliance. In this paper, we contribute the Safe-ROS architecture for developing reliable and verifiable autonomous robots in such domains. It features two distinct subsystems: (1) an intelligent control system that is responsible for normal/routine operations, and (2) a Safety System consisting of Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) that provide formally verifiable independent oversight. We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system. Our results demonstrate that the  Safe-ROS architecture can provide safety verifiable oversight while deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical domains, offering a robust framework that can be extended to additional requirements and various applications.

*Mahdi Etumi,Hazel M. Taylor,Marie Farrell*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of existing specification patterns for defining formal requirements in space missions, formulates new patterns when existing ones prove insufficient, and evaluates these contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity inherent in natural language requirements used in safety-critical systems and demonstrate the application of formal, specification-based requirements to space missions.

Method: A literature review of space mission requirements was conducted, formalising these using NASA's FRET tool, categorising them with existing patterns, developing 5 new specification patterns, and evaluating their utility with experts.

Result: Existing robotic specification patterns proved applicable to some space mission requirements, but gaps were identified, leading to the development of new patterns and their expert evaluation.

Conclusion: Formal specification patterns, including new and enhanced versions, are useful for representing space mission requirements, bridging gaps in existing frameworks.

Abstract: In the development of safety and mission-critical systems, including autonomous space robotic missions, complex behaviour is captured during the requirements elicitation phase. Requirements are typically expressed using natural language which is ambiguous and not amenable to formal verification methods that can provide robust guarantees of system behaviour. To support the definition of formal requirements, specification patterns provide reusable, logic-based templates. A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations.

*Dominik Grundt,Ishan Saxena,Malte Petersen,Bernd Westphal,Eike Möhlmann*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of explaining AI-driven autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior to promote trust and safety. It presents a methodology for providing context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of driving actions using Traffic Sequence Charts and runtime monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles must be trusted and safe to gain public acceptance. However, AI-driven decision processes in AVs are often opaque, making it difficult to explain system behaviors effectively. The paper aims to address this gap in explainability.

Method: The approach utilizes Traffic Sequence Charts to formalize explanation contexts for driving actions. It involves runtime monitoring to recognize context and provide ante-hoc explanations for (un)expectable driving maneuvers.

Result: The method has been successfully demonstrated in a simulated scenario (overtaking), showcasing its effectiveness in delivering context-aware explanations during runtime.

Conclusion: The proposed approach helps bridge the gap between providing correct and meaningful explanations for AV behavior, contributing to enhanced trust and safety in autonomous driving technologies.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be both safe and trustworthy to gain social acceptance and become a viable option for everyday public transportation. Explanations about the system behaviour can increase safety and trust in AVs. Unfortunately, explaining the system behaviour of AI-based driving functions is particularly challenging, as decision-making processes are often opaque. The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations. Our method is demonstrated in a simulated overtaking.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework integrating neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metrics to reconstruct microstructures in heterogeneous porous materials, enabling effective modeling even with small sample sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the characterization, reconstruction, and modeling of heterogeneous porous materials for better simulations, property linkage studies, and performance enhancement in engineering applications.

Method: Proposed a framework combining neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric to reconstruct microstructures. The approach utilizes local pattern distribution, controlled sampling strategy, and gradient optimization to generate and refine microstructures.

Result: Experiments on different materials showed that the proposed method is effective in stochastic, controllable, and large-size 3D microstructure reconstruction, as measured by visualization, statistical metrics, and physical property simulations.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust and reliable approach for microstructure reconstruction, offering new opportunities for structure-property linkage and material design with better controllability and applicability.

Abstract: Heterogeneous porous materials play a crucial role in various engineering systems. Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design.

### [397] [AI Kill Switch for malicious web-based LLM agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13725)
*Sechan Lee,Sangdon Park*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces "AI Kill Switch", a defensive technique that utilizes AutoGuard to prevent malicious misuse of web-based Large Language Model (LLM) agents by embedding invisible prompts into websites, achieving high effectiveness across multiple LLMs and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of web-based LLMs for complex tasks has raised risks for malicious misuse, such as unauthorized data collection and cyberattacks. This necessitates solutions to control these agents and mitigate their potential harmful impacts.

Method: The authors propose AutoGuard, which creates invisible defensive prompts embedded in website DOMs. These prompts are detected during the web-scraping process of malicious LLMs and activate their internal safety mechanisms to prevent harmful actions.

Result: AutoGuard demonstrated a Defense Success Rate (DSR) of over 80% on various malicious agents like GPT-4o and Claude-3. It showed even higher effectiveness (~90% DSR) against future generations like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

Conclusion: The study highlights the viability of monitoring and controlling malicious web-based LLMs, attaining significant success rates across diverse models, contributing to AI safety and control efforts.

Abstract: Recently, web-based Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously perform increasingly complex tasks, thereby bringing significant convenience. However, they also amplify the risks of malicious misuse cases such as unauthorized collection of personally identifiable information (PII), generation of socially divisive content, and even automated web hacking. To address these threats, we propose an AI Kill Switch technique that can immediately halt the operation of malicious web-based LLM agents. To achieve this, we introduce AutoGuard - the key idea is generating defensive prompts that trigger the safety mechanisms of malicious LLM agents. In particular, generated defense prompts are transparently embedded into the website's DOM so that they remain invisible to human users but can be detected by the crawling process of malicious agents, triggering its internal safety mechanisms to abort malicious actions once read. To evaluate our approach, we constructed a dedicated benchmark consisting of three representative malicious scenarios (PII collection, social rift content generation, and web hacking attempts). Experimental results show that the AutoGuard method achieves over 80% Defense Success Rate (DSR) on malicious agents, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. It also maintains strong performance, achieving around 90% DSR on GPT-5, GPT-4.1, and Gemini-2.5-Flash when used as the malicious agent, demonstrating robust generalization across models and scenarios. Through this research, we have demonstrated the controllability of web-based LLM agents across various scenarios and models, thereby contributing to the broader effort of AI control and safety.

### [398] [GRPO Privacy Is at Risk: A Membership Inference Attack Against Reinforcement Learning With Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14045)
*Yule Liu,Heyi Zhang,Jinyi Zheng,Zhen Sun,Zifan Peng,Tianshuo Cong,Yilong Yang,Xinlei He,Zhuo Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates privacy risks in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) training and proposes a novel membership inference attack framework, Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), to analyze these vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy concerns arising from membership inference attacks (MIAs) in RLVR-powered large language models (LLMs), where privacy leakage occurs through behavioral observations rather than memorization.

Method: The researchers propose DIBA, a framework that infers membership by monitoring behavioral changes via advantage-side improvement and logit-side divergence, focusing on RLVR's unique privacy leakage pattern.

Result: DIBA significantly outperforms existing methods in membership inference across diverse settings, achieving high evaluation metrics like 0.8 AUC and robust detection under various conditions.

Conclusion: This study systematically uncovers RLVR-specific privacy vulnerabilities, showing training data can be inferred from behavioral shifts rather than direct supervision, even under moderate defenses.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.
  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.

*Shaowei Guan,Yu Zhai,Zhengyu Zhang,Yanze Wang,Hin Chi Kwok*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ExplainableGuard is introduced as a defense framework for Large Language Models against adversarial attacks, using interpretable reasoning to neutralize perturbations and provide explanatory steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to adversarial manipulations that compromise their outputs, and current defense mechanisms often lack interpretability, making them less trustworthy.

Method: ExplainableGuard employs chain-of-thought reasoning through DeepSeek-Reasoner. It utilizes tailored prompts to perform extensive text analysis (character, word, structural, semantic) while generating purified outputs and human-readable justifications.

Result: Preliminary results on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB dataset show promising defense effectiveness, alongside human evaluation showing improvement in explanation clarity and user trust.

Conclusion: ExplainableGuard enhances both security against adversarial attacks and transparency in LLMs, improving deployability and user trust.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can subtly manipulate their outputs. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, many operate as black boxes, lacking transparency in their decision-making. This paper introduces ExplainableGuard, an interpretable adversarial defense framework leveraging the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Reasoner. Our approach not only detects and neutralizes adversarial perturbations in text but also provides step-by-step explanations for each defense action. We demonstrate how tailored CoT prompts guide the LLM to perform a multi-faceted analysis (character, word, structural, and semantic) and generate a purified output along with a human-readable justification. Preliminary results on the GLUE Benchmark and IMDB Movie Reviews dataset show promising defense efficacy. Additionally, a human evaluation study reveals that ExplainableGuard's explanations outperform ablated variants in clarity, specificity, and actionability, with a 72.5% deployability-trust rating, underscoring its potential for more trustworthy LLM deployments.

TL;DR: SteganoBackdoor introduces a covert backdoor attack method using natural-language steganography, capable of achieving high success rates with minimal data poisoning and evasion of defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a disconnect between advanced backdoor attack methods and real-world threat scenarios, focusing on semantic triggers tied to people/events instead of artificial ones.

Method: SteganoBackdoor uses gradient-guided optimization to convert semantic triggers into steganographic carriers, embedding backdoor payloads while maintaining fluency and no resemblance to the original triggers.

Result: The method achieved over 99% attack success with lower data-poisoning rates and demonstrated strong evasion capabilities against existing defenses.

Conclusion: SteganoBackdoor reveals vulnerabilities in current defenses and urges enhanced adversarial data defenses and realistic threat modeling in NLP systems.

Abstract: Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.

### [401] [Uncovering and Aligning Anomalous Attention Heads to Defend Against NLP Backdoor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13789)
*Haotian Jin,Yang Li,Haihui Fan,Lin Shen,Xiangfang Li,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes a method to detect and mitigate backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) by analyzing attention similarity and applying head-wise fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks on LLMs have evolved to use dynamic or implicit triggers, making it hard for existing defensive methods to detect or mitigate them efficiently.

Method: An attention similarity-based backdoor detection approach combined with attention safety alignment and head-wise fine-tuning for rectification of compromised attention heads.

Result: The proposed method significantly decreases backdoor attack success rates while preserving the LLM's downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Using attention mechanisms for backdoor detection and mitigation proves effective, offering a robust and generalizable defense against various backdoor attacks in LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the security of large language models (LLMs), causing them to exhibit anomalous behavior under specific trigger conditions. The design of backdoor triggers has evolved from fixed triggers to dynamic or implicit triggers. This increased flexibility in trigger design makes it challenging for defenders to identify their specific forms accurately. Most existing backdoor defense methods are limited to specific types of triggers or rely on an additional clean model for support. To address this issue, we propose a backdoor detection method based on attention similarity, enabling backdoor detection without prior knowledge of the trigger. Our study reveals that models subjected to backdoor attacks exhibit unusually high similarity among attention heads when exposed to triggers. Based on this observation, we propose an attention safety alignment approach combined with head-wise fine-tuning to rectify potentially contaminated attention heads, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of backdoor attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the success rate of backdoor attacks while preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks.

### [402] [Zipf-Gramming: Scaling Byte N-Grams Up to Production Sized Malware Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13808)
*Edward Raff,Ryan R. Curtin,Derek Everett,Robert J. Joyce,James Holt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study presents a Zipf-Gramming algorithm that accelerates top-k n-gram extraction by 35x, allowing better malware detection models with up to 30% AUC improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to meet stringent requirements for size, speed, and latency in malware detection, and overcome inefficiencies in traditional n-gram analysis over terabytes of data.

Method: The authors propose a top-k n-gram extraction algorithm (Zipf-Gramming) leveraging the Zipfian distribution of n-grams to drastically enhance speed and scalability while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Using the proposed algorithm, model training scaled up significantly, leading to a maximum of 30% improvement in AUC for detecting new malware cases.

Conclusion: The Zipf-Gramming algorithm effectively addresses computational and deployment challenges in scalable n-gram-based malware detection, making production ready updates viable and improving classifier performance.

Abstract: A classifier using byte n-grams as features is the only approach we have found fast enough to meet requirements in size (sub 2 MB), speed (multiple GB/s), and latency (sub 10 ms) for deployment in numerous malware detection scenarios. However, we've consistently found that 6-8 grams achieve the best accuracy on our production deployments but have been unable to deploy regularly updated models due to the high cost of finding the top-k most frequent n-grams over terabytes of executable programs. Because the Zipfian distribution well models the distribution of n-grams, we exploit its properties to develop a new top-k n-gram extractor that is up to $35\times$ faster than the previous best alternative. Using our new Zipf-Gramming algorithm, we are able to scale up our production training set and obtain up to 30\% improvement in AUC at detecting new malware. We show theoretically and empirically that our approach will select the top-k items with little error and the interplay between theory and engineering required to achieve these results.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MalRAG, a retrieval-augmented LLM framework, advances open-set malicious traffic identification by leveraging multi-view traffic databases and adaptive methods for evidence retrieval and pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of cyber threats calls for effective systems capable of identifying both known and novel malicious traffic.

Method: MalRAG utilizes a frozen LLM, multi-view traffic databases, adaptive retrieval algorithms, traffic-aware pruning, and tailored guidance prompts for task execution.

Result: MalRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying known malicious classes and discovering novel threats across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: MalRAG demonstrates the efficacy of LLM-driven frameworks for cybersecurity applications, successfully combining multi-view knowledge and adaptive methods without relying on specific LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery. Ablation and deep-dive analyses further show that MalRAG effective leverages LLM capabilities yet achieves open-set malicious traffic identification without relying on a specific LLM.

*Zhengchunmin Dai,Jiaxiong Tang,Peng Sun,Honglong Chen,Liantao Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: In decentralized learning setups, capability-limited server systems are vulnerable to intellectual property theft. This paper introduces Sigil, a watermarking framework addressing these vulnerabilities by leveraging statistical constraints and adaptive mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to protect intellectual property of capability-limited servers, commonly found in decentralized machine learning frameworks like Split Federated Learning, which are vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients.

Method: Sigil embeds watermarks as statistical constraints into the activation space visible to the server, leveraging gradient injection without requiring data access. Adaptive gradient clipping is employed to enhance stealth and robustness against attacks.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and models exhibit Sigil's effectiveness in preserving fidelity, ensuring robustness of the watermark, and maintaining its stealth against gradient anomaly detection and subspace removal attacks.

Conclusion: Sigil offers a reliable and stealthy solution for intellectual property protection in decentralized learning environments, solving challenges linked to capability-limited server models in adversarial settings.

Abstract: In decentralized machine learning paradigms such as Split Federated Learning (SFL) and its variant U-shaped SFL, the server's capabilities are severely restricted. Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.
  To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.

Method: The study conducted the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) using the Microsoft Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent to assess analyst output in terms of true positives and accuracy.

Result: Agent-augmented analysts increased true positives per minute by up to 6.5 times and improved verdict accuracy by 77%. They spent 53% more time on malicious emails, indicating increased focus while avoiding over-reliance on AI suggestions.

Conclusion: AI agents, like the Phishing Triage Agent, can substantially enhance SOC productivity and accuracy, altering resource allocation strategies and helping SOC leaders with AI implementation decisions.

Abstract: Security operations centers (SOCs) face a persistent challenge: efficiently triaging a high volume of user-reported phishing emails while maintaining robust protection against threats. This paper presents the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a domain-specific AI agent - the Microsoft Security Copilot Phishing Triage Agent - on analyst productivity and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that agent-augmented analysts achieved up to 6.5 times as many true positives per analyst minute and a 77% improvement in verdict accuracy compared to a control group. The agent's queue prioritization and verdict explanations were both significant drivers of efficiency. Behavioral analysis revealed that agent-augmented analysts reallocated their attention, spending 53% more time on malicious emails, and were not prone to rubber-stamping the agent's malicious verdicts. These findings offer actionable insights for SOC leaders considering AI adoption, including the potential for agents to fundamentally change the optimal allocation of SOC resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of AI agents in automating and improving identity governance tasks, where evidence of impact is limited.

Method: The study involved 162 identity administrators assigned randomly to either a control (no agent) or treatment (agent-assisted) group to perform tasks like policy merging and Zero-Trust baseline gap detection.

Result: The AI agent improved task accuracy by 48% and decreased task completion time by 43% while maintaining accuracy, particularly excelling in cognitively demanding tasks.

Conclusion: Purpose-built AI agents can significantly enhance productivity and precision in identity governance workflows.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex enterprise workflows, yet evidence of their effectiveness in identity governance is limited. We report results from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an AI agent for Conditional Access (CA) policy management in Microsoft Entra. The agent assists with four high-value tasks: policy merging, Zero-Trust baseline gap detection, phased rollout planning, and user-policy alignment. In a production-grade environment, 162 identity administrators were randomly assigned to a control group (no agent) or treatment group (agent-assisted) and asked to perform these tasks. Agent access produced substantial gains: accuracy improved by 48% and task completion time decreased by 43% while holding accuracy constant. The largest benefits emerged on cognitively demanding tasks such as baseline gap detection. These findings demonstrate that purpose-built AI agents can significantly enhance both speed and accuracy in identity administration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between technical AI approaches and socio-ethical considerations, addressing fairness and accountability in socio-technical systems.

Method: Applied information flow-based modeling framework combined with semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling to construct a multi-level representation of recruitment pipelines.

Result: Identified bias emergence points, propagation paths, and downstream impacts on candidates within a recruitment system combining algorithmic and human decision-making.

Conclusion: Information flow modeling provides systematic transparency and structured fairness risk analysis in complex socio-technical systems like recruitment pipelines.

Abstract: Avoiding bias and understanding the real-world consequences of AI-supported decision-making are critical to address fairness and assign accountability. Existing approaches often focus either on technical aspects, such as datasets and models, or on high-level socio-ethical considerations - rarely capturing how these elements interact in practice. In this paper, we apply an information flow-based modeling framework to a real-world recruitment process that integrates automated candidate matching with human decision-making. Through semi-structured stakeholder interviews and iterative modeling, we construct a multi-level representation of the recruitment pipeline, capturing how information is transformed, filtered, and interpreted across both algorithmic and human components. We identify where biases may emerge, how they can propagate through the system, and what downstream impacts they may have on candidates. This case study illustrates how information flow modeling can support structured analysis of fairness risks, providing transparency across complex socio-technical systems.

TL;DR: This paper explores how AI/ML is used by researchers in manufacturing and materials sciences, highlighting benefits like cost and time savings, alongside challenges such as reliability issues outside dense data areas and risks to theoretical advances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and evaluate the extent to which AI can accelerate innovation processes in manufacturing and materials science.

Method: Interviews with 32 U.S.-based academic researchers experienced in applying AI/ML techniques in manufacturing and materials science were conducted.

Result: AI/ML tools were mainly used to model materials and manufacturing processes, yielding benefits such as cheaper, faster design space exploration, but showed limitations in reliability and risks impacting theoretical advancements.

Conclusion: While AI/ML offers optimism for accelerating incremental innovations, maintaining conventional research approaches is crucial for major breakthroughs in the fields.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.

These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score. The findings revealed that the simulated neurodiverse students struggled with learning due to lecture slides that were in inaccessible formats. These results highlight the need to provide course materials in multiple formats for diverse learner preferences. Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in high-dimensional numerical optimization, particularly in complex, non-differentiable problems affected by the curse of dimensionality.

Method: QUASAR integrates a stochastic architecture in Differential Evolution (DE) to balance exploration and exploitation, utilizing probabilistic mutation strategies, rank-based crossovers, and a reinitialization mechanism that enhances genetic diversity.

Result: QUASAR achieved the lowest rank sum (150) on the CEC2017 benchmark, outperforming L-SHADE and DE. It also demonstrated faster computation, being 1.4x faster than DE and 7.8x faster than L-SHADE.

Conclusion: QUASAR is an effective and user-friendly optimizer, making it a valuable tool for solving complex high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials.
  Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.
  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.

TL;DR: This paper investigates distributionally robust games with agents having diverse risk aversion levels. An algorithm is developed for learning Nash equilibrium efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributional robustness with heterogeneous risk aversion is crucial for understanding games under uncertainty, which helps model real-world decision-making in collaborative or competitive settings.

Method: The authors utilize Lagrangian-based penalties for imposing heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints and reformulate the problem as a variational inequality with strong monotonicity. They propose a Nash equilibrium-seeking algorithm for practical implementation.

Result: They prove the algorithm's convergence via diminishing average regret and validate their approaches with numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical foundation and practical algorithm for approximating Nash equilibrium in robust games, contributing to robust and risk-aware decision-making models.

Abstract: We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of distributed compression algorithms that degrade convergence, especially by introducing parameter agnostic methods without reliance on problem-specific tuning.

Method: Introduce normalized error feedback algorithms combining EF with momentum variants and time-varying stepsizes, deriving parameter-agnostic convergence and complexity bounds.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve convergence rates near O(1/T^{1/4}) for Polyak's momentum, O(1/T^{2/7}) for IGT, and O(1/T^{1/3}) for STORM, confirmed through theoretical and empirical validation with decreasing stepsizes and small mini-batches.

Conclusion: The developed normalized EF algorithms eliminate the need for problem-specific tuning, achieve competitive convergence rates, and are validated through experiments, making them scalable and effective for distributed training.

Abstract: Communication compression is essential for scalable distributed training of modern machine learning models, but it often degrades convergence due to the noise it introduces. Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum. Our results hold with decreasing stepsizes and small mini-batches. Finally, our empirical experiments confirm our theoretical insights.

TL;DR: This paper proposes THD-BAR, an improved model for EEG representation learning, utilizing hierarchical spatial topology alongside temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods lack efficient modeling of the spatial topology inherent in EEG signals, undermining their ability to capture dynamic brain activity.

Method: Introduces Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH) for multi-scale spatial order of EEG channels, employs THVQ-VAE for tokenization, and develops a new Brain Autoregressive module with advanced masking.

Result: Validated on 10 downstream datasets, the THD-BAR consistently outperformed existing methods across 5 tasks, showcasing better generalization and modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: THD-BAR effectively addresses limitations of spatial-temporal modeling in EEG data, demonstrating superior performance and broader application potential for large-scale EEG models.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a "next-scale-time prediction" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.

### [418] [DualLaguerreNet: A Decoupled Spectral Filter GNN and the Uncovering of the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13729)
*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualLaguerreNet, a new graph neural network (GNN) with improved handling of heterophily but highlights a trade-off of flexibility and stability, showing that simpler models help regularization in certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs based on spectral filters struggle with heterophily and over-smoothing due to the limitation of single adaptive parameters, which compromises optimal filtering across the graph spectrum.

Method: The proposed DualLaguerreNet uses two separate spectral filters for low and high frequencies, decoupling the graph spectrum with independent adaptive parameters (alpha_1, alpha_2) to enhance flexibility.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for heterophilic tasks but underperforms on homophilic ones, revealing a fundamental trade-off between model flexibility and stability due to overfitting on simpler tasks.

Conclusion: DualLaguerreNet demonstrates advanced performance for complex heterogeneous graphs but exposes the inherent bias-variance trade-offs in adaptive GNN designs; simpler models provide essential regularization for stability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to implement state space models (SSMs) in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware for real-time, event-driven processing, optimizing both accuracy and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the power of SSMs for long sequence processing while addressing the need for energy-efficient and real-time processing using hardware like CIM systems.

Method: The approach re-parameterizes the SSMs with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, aligning them for practical hardware implementation. It utilizes device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters in crossbar-based CIM systems with memristors.

Result: The proposed system achieves high accuracy and energy efficiency, supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of co-designing algorithms and hardware for implementing SSMs in energy-efficient systems, enabling advanced real-time processing in event-driven tasks.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.

### [420] [GegenbauerNet: Finding the Optimal Compromise in the GNN Flexibility-Stability Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13730)
*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces GegenbauerNet, a novel GNN filtering method that balances flexibility and stability for spectral GNNs in the [-1, 1] domain, improving performance on heterophilic graphs and showing domain optimization depends on design trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral GNNs like ChebyNet and L-JacobiNet struggle with a flexibility-stability trade-off in their design. Previous work showed higher stability (like with S-JacobiNet) often outperformed higher adaptability, highlighting the need for optimized trade-offs in filtering design.

Method: The authors propose GegenbauerNet, utilizing the Gegenbauer polynomials with a single learnable parameter (lambda), to maintain a balanced blend of stability and adaptability. They study its performance across datasets and design analysis.

Result: GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) outperforms other models in local filtering tasks, especially for heterophilic graphs (K=2). However, L-JacobiNet remains superior for high-K filtering tasks, confirming the need for flexibility given proper regularization.

Conclusion: The optimal spectral GNN filter in the [-1, 1] domain depends on balancing flexibility and stability, based on task locality (K) and design biases, guiding GNN developers in architectural choices.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a convolutional neural network model for early prediction of neonatal seizures, achieving high accuracy and addressing EEG-based diagnosis challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neonatal seizures are difficult to diagnose due to subtle clinical signs, leading to risks of untreated seizures and brain injury. There is a need for an efficient, patient-independent predictive model.

Method: The paper presented a convolutional neural network using EEG and ECG data processed into mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices, validated on a neonatal EEG dataset with methods like SHAP for explainability.

Result: The model achieved 97.52% accuracy, 98.31% sensitivity, 96.39% specificity, and 97.95% F1-score, with improvements from ECG and attention mechanisms in seizure prediction up to 30 minutes earlier.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates potential for practical use in neonatal ICUs, offering reliable and transparent seizure prediction with minimal supervision and good generalization across subjects.

Abstract: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of signal classification in contested radio spectrum environments by introducing a CNN model with frequency-domain shift equivariance and demonstrates its robustness against Doppler shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automatic signal classification in contested environments, eliminating reliance on brute-force Doppler augmentation, which reduces efficiency and interpretability.

Method: The study proposes a CNN architecture with complex-valued layers, leveraging shift equivariance in the frequency domain. It uses adaptive polyphase sampling layers and a global average pooling layer for provable frequency bin shift invariance.

Result: Experimental results on a synthetic interference signal dataset show that the proposed model retains classification accuracy despite Doppler shifts, even without being trained on such data.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a framework for signal classification with robust invariance to real-world effects like Doppler shifts, improving both training efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Radio spectrum monitoring in contested environments motivates the need for reliable automatic signal classification technology. Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Apo2Mol is a diffusion-based generative model for 3D drug design that accounts for protein pocket flexibility, improving ligand generation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in current drug design models arise from neglecting protein flexibility and conformational changes upon ligand binding.

Method: Apo2Mol uses a hierarchical graph-based diffusion model on a curated dataset of apo-holo structure pairs to generate both ligands and corresponding protein conformations.

Result: Empirical validation shows state-of-the-art generation of high-affinity ligands and realistic protein pocket conformations.

Conclusion: Accounting for protein flexibility significantly enhances practical drug discovery applications with improved ligand and binding accuracy.

Abstract: Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle bottlenecks in input data preprocessing, which slow down the training time of concurrent multimedia ML models.

Method: Seneca employs a performance model for cache partitioning and opportunistic caching to enhance the DSI pipeline, implemented by modifying PyTorch.

Result: Seneca reduces the makespan by 45.23% and increases data processing throughput by up to 3.45x compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: Seneca significantly improves the efficiency of data preprocessing in ML training, showcasing better performance over existing systems.

Abstract: Input data preprocessing is a common bottleneck when concurrently training multimedia machine learning (ML) models in modern systems. To alleviate these bottlenecks and reduce the training time for concurrent jobs, we present Seneca, a data loading system that optimizes cache partitioning and data sampling for the data storage and ingestion (DSI) pipeline. The design of Seneca contains two key techniques. First, Seneca uses a performance model for the data pipeline to optimally partition the cache for three different forms of data (encoded, decoded, and augmented). Second, Seneca opportunistically serves cached data over uncached ones during random batch sampling so that concurrent jobs benefit from each other. We implement Seneca by modifying PyTorch and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it against several state-of-the-art caching systems for DNN training. Seneca reduces the makespan by 45.23% compared to PyTorch and increases data processing throughput by up to 3.45x compared to the next best dataloader.

TL;DR: The paper elaborates a fully automated method for proving complex number identities using elimination ideals, implemented in major algebra systems and tested in dynamic geometry software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aimed to develop a fully automated and efficient procedure for verifying complex number identities, addressing limitations in existing manual or semi-automated methods.

Method: A declarative approach was taken by rewriting hypotheses and the thesis with slack variables, clearing denominators, and eliminating variables to derive conclusive results using an ideal in the domain of elimination ideals.

Result: The proposed method was implemented in Mathematica, Maple, Giac, and a prototype integration with GeoGebra, showcasing its practical feasibility.

Conclusion: The method enhances the ability to automate complex number identity proofs, offering versatility across algebra systems and dynamic geometry software for expanded applicability.

Abstract: We improve the complex number identity proving method to a fully automated procedure, based on elimination ideals. By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role that if $r_1,r_2,\ldots$ are real, $r$ must also be real if there is a linear polynomial $p(r)\in I$, unless division by zero occurs when expressing $r$. Our results are presented in Mathematica, Maple and in a new version of the Giac computer algebra system. Finally, we present a prototype of the automated procedure in an experimental version of the dynamic geometry software GeoGebra.

Motivation: To understand the evolution and current trends in short-term passenger flow forecasting research, identifying gaps and connecting it to broader fields like machine learning.

Method: The authors used bibliometric analysis tools, citation networks, and topic modeling to examine 814 publications from 1984 to 2024.

Result: The analysis shows a shift from traditional statistical/machine learning approaches to specialized deep learning, identifies spatial, linguistic, and modal biases, and validates gaps in data fusion, model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and deployment challenges.

Conclusion: The study highlights opportunities for addressing gaps in the field, emphasizes the growing importance of foundation models, and connects forecasting research to broader domains like machine learning and time series modeling.

Abstract: This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the field of short-term passenger flow forecasting within local public transit, covering 814 publications that span from 1984 to 2024. In addition to common bibliometric analysis tools, a variant of a citation network was developed, and topic modelling was conducted. The analysis reveals that research activity exhibited sporadic patterns prior to 2008, followed by a marked acceleration, characterised by a shift from conventional statistical and machine learning methodologies (e.g., ARIMA, SVM, and basic neural networks) to specialised deep learning architectures. Based on this insight, a connection to more general fields such as machine learning and time series modelling was established. In addition to modelling, spatial, linguistic, and modal biases were identified and findings from existing secondary literature were validated and quantified. This revealed existing gaps, such as constrained data fusion, open (multivariate) data, and underappreciated challenges related to model interpretability, cost-efficiency, and a balance between algorithmic performance and practical deployment considerations. In connection with the superordinate fields, the growth in relevance of foundation models is also noteworthy.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper develops Rdgai, a software leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate classification of textual changes in phylogenetic analysis, demonstrated using Arabic Gospel translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textual phylogenetics traditionally assumes equal treatment of changes, despite acknowledging certain variants are more likely to occur, making weighted analysis crucial but challenging.

Method: Bayesian phylogenetics paired with Rdgai software, utilizing user annotations and LLM prompts for automated classification of textual changes, stored in TEI XML for analysis.

Result: The Rdgai tool successfully streamlines reading classification workflows for phylogenetic analysis using labeled Arabic Gospel translations.

Conclusion: The software reduces barriers to complex probabilistic phylogenetic analysis by automating labor-intensive processes, enabling robust textual tradition studies.

Abstract: Application of phylogenetic methods to textual traditions has traditionally treated all changes as equivalent even though it is widely recognized that certain types of variants were more likely to be introduced than others. While it is possible to give weights to certain changes using a maximum parsimony evaluation criterion, it is difficult to state a priori what these weights should be. Probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian phylogenetics, allow users to create categories of changes, and the transition rates for each category can be estimated as part of the analysis. This classification of types of changes in readings also allows for inspecting the probability of these categories across each branch in the resulting trees. However, classification of readings is time-consuming, as it requires categorizing each reading against every other reading at each variation unit, presenting a significant barrier to entry for this kind of analysis. This paper presents Rdgai, a software package that automates this classification task using multi-lingual large language models (LLMs). The tool allows users to easily manually classify changes in readings and then it uses these annotations in the prompt for an LLM to automatically classify the remaining reading transitions. These classifications are stored in TEI XML and ready for downstream phylogenetic analysis. This paper demonstrates the application with data an Arabic translation of the Gospels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of scientific publications demands trustworthy systems for synthesizing cross-disciplinary knowledge, addressing limitations of current retrieval-augmented generation methods.

Method: SciRAG introduces adaptive retrieval, citation-aware symbolic reasoning leveraging citation graphs, and outline-guided synthesis to enhance coherence and factual accuracy.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks like QASA and ScholarQA demonstrate SciRAG’s superiority in factual accuracy and synthesis quality compared to previous systems.

Conclusion: SciRAG establishes a reliable foundation for scalable, coherent, and transparent scientific knowledge aggregation in literature exploration.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of scientific publications has intensified the need for scalable, trustworthy systems to synthesize knowledge across diverse literature. While recent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have improved access to scientific information, they often overlook citation graph structure, adapt poorly to complex queries, and yield fragmented, hard-to-verify syntheses. We introduce SciRAG, an open-source framework for scientific literature exploration that addresses these gaps through three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval that flexibly alternates between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning that leverages citation graphs to organize and filter supporting documents; and (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers to ensure coherence and transparent attribution. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks such as QASA and ScholarQA demonstrate that SciRAG outperforms prior systems in factual accuracy and synthesis quality, establishing a new foundation for reliable, large-scale scientific knowledge aggregation.

*Rongsheng Qian,Chi Xu,Xiaoqiang Ma,Hao Fang,Yili Jin,William I. Atlas,Jiangchuan Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE, a self-supervised sonar image compression and artifact correction system addressing uplink bandwidth and image quality challenges, showcasing improved structural similarity and bandwidth efficiency in real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable broader use of real-time imaging sonar in underwater environments by addressing bandwidth limitations and severe artifact issues in sonar images, which impede underwater monitoring and detection.

Method: The authors present SCOPE, a framework utilizing Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC) and Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS) to compress images and correct artifacts without needing clean-noise data pairs. It uses frequency-aware latent representations and low-frequency structural segmentation with a self-supervised learning strategy.

Result: SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, a 40% improvement over alternatives, while reducing transmission bitrates to as low as 0.0118 bpp. It also reduces uplink bandwidth by over 80%, works in real-time, and enhances downstream detection.

Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates the feasibility of low-bitrate sonar streaming with high signal preservation, enabling practical, real-world deployment for environmental monitoring and salmon enumeration in rivers.

Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PoCGM, a conditional generative method for sparse-view CT reconstruction that suppresses artifacts and preserves structural details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the projection views in CT aids in minimizing radiation exposure and enhancing temporal resolution but leads to severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details.

Method: The Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) is reformulated into a conditional framework named PoCGM, integrating sparse-view data as guidance during training and sampling to model full-view reconstructions.

Result: PoCGM successfully suppresses artifacts, preserves fine structural details, and outperforms baseline models, particularly in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging applications.

Conclusion: PoCGM proves effective and reliable for sparse-view CT reconstruction, presenting significant advancements in artifact suppression and detail preservation over existing methods.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), reducing the number of projection views is an effective strategy to lower radiation exposure and/or improve temporal resolution. However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the compression efficiency of hierarchical LiDAR geometry compression by addressing inefficiencies in how prior methods process different bit-depths independently.

Method: Key methods include cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) scheme for adaptive coding network selection, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy to optimize entropy modeling and reduce latency.

Conclusion: The proposed ELiC framework enhances LiDAR geometry compression by combining innovative techniques, offering better compression efficiency and real-time operation. Code and models will be shared upon publication.

Abstract: Hierarchical LiDAR geometry compression encodes voxel occupancies from low to high bit-depths, yet prior methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, limiting compression efficiency. We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: The paper compares processing-in-memory (PIM) and CXL-PIM architectures, highlighting trade-offs between disjoint and unified address spaces for performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance limitations caused by disjoint host and device address spaces in PIM and assessing whether CXL-PIM’s unified address space and cache-coherence could mitigate those issues despite higher latency.

Method: Conducting large-scale experiments using real PIM hardware and trace-driven modeling for CXL, focusing on side-by-side performance comparisons.

Result: The study identifies scenarios where unified-address access mitigates latency trade-offs and when tightly coupled PIM architecture performs better based on phase and dataset size.

Conclusion: Provides insight into workload-dependent trade-offs and practical design considerations for future near-memory systems leveraging PIM or CXL-PIM architectures.

Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data movement by executing near memory, but our large-scale characterization on real PIM hardware shows that end-to-end performance is often limited by disjoint host and device address spaces that force explicit staging transfers. In contrast, CXL-PIM provides a unified address space and cache-coherent access at the cost of higher access latency. These opposing interface models create workload-dependent tradeoffs that are not captured by small-scale studies. This work presents a side-by-side, large-scale comparison of PIM and CXL-PIM using measurements from real PIM hardware and trace-driven CXL modeling. We identify when unified-address access amortizes link latency enough to overcome transfer bottlenecks, and when tightly coupled PIM remains preferable. Our results reveal phase- and dataset-size regimes in which the relative ranking between the two architectures reverses, offering practical guidance for future near-memory system design.

### [434] [Who Moved My Distribution? Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11567)
*Allen Emmanuel Binny,Anushri Dixit*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative conformal prediction framework to adapt learned models for predicting the behavior of interactive agents in motion planning, addressing endogenous distribution shifts and ensuring probabilistic safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and safe prediction of agent behavior is crucial for motion planning, but existing uncertainty-aware methods struggle to handle the responses from interactive agents, leading to distribution shifts.

Method: The authors propose an iterative conformal prediction framework that adapts ego-agent controllers to endogenous distribution shifts in interactive scenarios while maintaining probabilistic safety.

Result: The approach shows up to 9.6% improvement in success rates, achieves collision avoidance, and avoids overly conservative behaviors during simulations with 2- and 3-agent interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles distribution shifts caused by interactions, providing robust and safe predictions for motion planning in interactive environments.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift. We validate our framework in simulation for 2- and 3- agent interaction scenarios, demonstrating collision avoidance without resulting in overly conservative behavior and an overall improvement in success rates of up to 9.6% compared to other conformal prediction-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in solving real-time optimization problems in MPC, particularly for systems with complex high-fidelity models over long horizons.

Method: A multi-timescale scheme is proposed, using a reduced model for dominant dynamics and exponentially increasing integration step sizes to simplify computations along the prediction horizon.

Result: Simulation results on robotic control problems show computational speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The approach improves computational efficiency in MPC, making it viable for systems with both fast and slow dynamics in practical applications.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has established itself as the primary methodology for constrained control, enabling autonomy across diverse applications. While model fidelity is crucial in MPC, solving the corresponding optimization problem in real time remains challenging when combining long horizons with high-fidelity models that capture both short-term dynamics and long-term behavior. Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon. We evaluate the method on three practically motivated robotic control problems in simulation and observe speed-ups of up to an order of magnitude.

Motivation: To address the challenge of performance degradation in traffic signal control algorithms due to traffic condition distribution shifts.

Method: Developed a GEH-based distance function to compare demand histograms representing traffic scenarios in a policy-independent and interpretable way.

Result: Validated on 20 simulated scenarios using NEMA actuated and reinforcement learning controllers, showing the method predicts degradation better than existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for predicting and managing performance under distribution shift, and can be applied for adaptive traffic signal control benchmarking and monitoring.

Abstract: Traffic signal control algorithms are vulnerable to distribution shift, where performance degrades under traffic conditions that differ from those seen during design or training. This paper introduces a principled approach to quantify distribution shift by representing traffic scenarios as demand histograms and comparing them with a GEH-based distance function. The method is policy-independent, interpretable, and leverages a widely used traffic engineering statistic. We validate the approach on 20 simulated scenarios using both a NEMA actuated controller and a reinforcement learning controller (FRAP++). Results show that larger scenario distances consistently correspond to increased travel time and reduced throughput, with particularly strong explanatory power for learning-based control. Overall, this method can predict performance degradation under distribution shift better than previously published techniques. These findings highlight the utility of the proposed framework for benchmarking, training regime design, and monitoring in adaptive traffic signal control.

Method: Developed a deep learning-based model predictive control using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for probability density shaping and optimized through Automatic Differentiation.

Result: Numerical simulations on compliant wing models showed effectiveness against stochastic gust profiles, reducing aerodynamic loads and wing tip deflection.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances stochastic gust load alleviation for compliant wings, improving both aerodynamic load control and structural response.

Abstract: This study presents a novel deep learning approach aimed at enhancing stochastic Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) specifically for compliant wings. The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles. The evaluation involved stochastic aerodynamic loads generated from Band-Limited White Noise (BLWN) and Dryden gust models. The evaluation were conducted for two distinct Compliant Chord Fractions (CCF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probability density shaping model predictive control in alleviating stochastic gust load and reducing wing tip deflection.

Result: CNN model achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, uncovering key motifs in protein sequences.

Conclusion: Deep learning can both precisely classify protein functions and reveal biologically significant motifs, enhancing sequence analysis.

Abstract: Proteins perform essential biological functions, and accurate classification of their sequences is critical for understanding structure-function relationships, enzyme mechanisms, and molecular interactions. This study presents a deep learning-based framework for functional group classification of protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Four architectures were implemented: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid, and CNN with Attention. Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes. These findings highlight that deep learning models can uncover functionally relevant biochemical signatures, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in protein sequence analysis.

TL;DR: The study introduces MAT-MPNN, a novel deep learning framework, for improving county-level HIV forecast accuracy using dynamic mobility-aware spatial structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing methods in modeling non-contiguous spatial and temporal dependencies in HIV diagnoses.

Method: Proposed MAT-MPNN combining a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG) with a Transformer encoder to enhance HIV diagnosis rate predictions.

Result: MAT-MPNN outperformed baseline models, reducing MSPE by up to 39.1% and improving PMCC across multiple regions.

Conclusion: Mobility-aware dynamic spatial modeling offers significant improvements in spatiotemporal prediction of epidemiological data.

Abstract: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to improve the detection accuracy of coronal holes (CHs) in the solar corona by creating an advanced dataset and evaluation method due to the limitations of existing approaches.

Method: They developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline (CHASM tool) to digitize maps of coronal holes into binary segmentation masks, resulting in the CHASM-SWPC dataset. They used these masks to train and evaluate CHRONNOS neural network models.

Result: The CHASM-SWPC dataset allowed the CHRONNOS model to achieve high performance, with an accuracy of 0.9805 and improvements in True Skill Statistic (TSS) and IoU compared to a pretrained CHRONNOS model.

Conclusion: The CHASM-SWPC dataset and associated tool successfully enhance automated coronal hole detection. This work contributes both valuable datasets and improved methods for solar physics and space weather research.

Abstract: Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of online-trained machine learning models for subgrid-scale (SGS) processes in bounded turbulent flow domains, with results showing stability and accuracy over lengthy simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address limitations of prior studies that used idealized periodic domains and neglected the presence of mechanical boundaries in planetary interiors.

Method: The authors implemented a differentiable pseudo-spectral solver for two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in bounded domains. Online training of the SGS models was conducted using specific geometries, rotation rates, and analytical forcing.

Result: The trained SGS models were stable and accurate over simulations 100 times longer than the training period. They also effectively captured slow dynamical processes, such as jet drift in a spherical shell.

Conclusion: Online-trained SGS models hold potential for advancing the modeling of planetary and stellar interior dynamics, showing high promise for long-term stability and accuracy.

Abstract: The use of machine learning to represent subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics is now well established in weather forecasting and climate modelling. Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.

Abstract: We develop an imaging algorithm that exploits strong scattering to achieve super-resolution in changing random media.

Starting from random initializations, the algorithm reliably extracts the unknown medium properties necessary for accurate imaging using back-propagation, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. Remarkably, scattering enhances resolution beyond homogeneous medium limits. When abundant data are available, the algorithm allows the realization of super-resolution in imaging.

*Moran Yanuka,Paul Dixon,Eyal Finkelshtein,Daniel Rotman,Raja Giryes*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Introducing a decoding method called Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG) for fast and efficient autoregressive speech generation with guaranteed acoustic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and acceptance rates of speech generation models by overcoming restrictions posed by exact token matching in speculative decoding.

Method: PCG organizes speech tokens into Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from a target model's embedding space and adjusts the probability mass distribution accordingly to perform rejection sampling.

Result: PCG increases acceptance rates, improves throughput, and maintains intelligibility and speech quality relative to conventional methods, shown in experiments on LibriTTS.

Conclusion: Acoustically informed, group-level verification can effectively accelerate speech token generation without compromising acoustic and speaker quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.

TL;DR: This paper examines MPTCP performance in path-heterogeneity conditions, assessing algorithms for packet scheduling and congestion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges faced by MPTCP in using heterogeneous network paths while improving protocol performance.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive experimental evaluation to analyze different algorithm combinations for MPTCP operation under diverse conditions.

Result: The evaluation highlighted the impact of algorithm combinations on MPTCP performance under varying levels of path heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Optimizing the choice of scheduling and congestion control algorithms can significantly enhance MPTCP's efficiency in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Modern mobile and stationary devices are equipped with multiple network interfaces aiming to provide wireless and wireline connectivity either in a local LAN or the Internet. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol has been developed on top of legacy TCP to allow the simultaneous use of multiple network paths in the communication route between two end-systems. Although the combination of multiple paths is beneficial in case of links with similar network characteristics, MPTCP performance is challenged as heterogeneity among the used paths increases. This work provides an overview of the MPTCP protocol operation, analyzes the state-of-art packet scheduling and congestion control algorithms available in literature, and examines the impact of the various algorithm combinations on MPTCP performance, by conducting an extensive experimental evaluation under diverse path-heterogeneity conditions.

### [450] [CellStream: Dynamical Optimal Transport Informed Embeddings for Reconstructing Cellular Trajectories from Snapshots Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13786)
*Yue Ling,Peiqi Zhang,Zhenyi Zhang,Peijie Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: CellStream enhances single-cell RNA sequencing analysis by integrating deep learning for dynamic embedding and accurate cellular trajectory representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data struggle with technical noise and sparse temporal snapshots, impacting the accuracy of continuous transcriptional dynamics representation.

Method: CellStream combines an autoencoder and unbalanced dynamical optimal transport to simultaneously learn embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data.

Result: CellStream demonstrated improved temporal developmental process representation and noise reduction in both simulated and real-data experiments, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CellStream offers a significant advancement for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, providing accurate dynamics-informed embeddings sensitive to temporal coherence.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), especially temporally resolved datasets, enables genome-wide profiling of gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution across discrete time points. However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity. Overall, CellStream provides a new tool for learning and representing continuous streams from the noisy, static snapshots of single-cell gene expression.

### [451] [Near-Lossless Model Compression Enables Longer Context Inference in DNA Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14694)
*Rui Zhu,Xiaopu Zhou,Haixu Tang,Stephen W. Scherer,Lucila Ohno-Machado*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOCUS, a novel compression module for DNA large language models (LLMs), enabling ultra-long sequence modeling with reduced computational cost and memory usage, while maintaining near-lossless fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of DNA LLMs, which are hindered by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and memory requirements for key-value caches, especially when modeling ultra-long genomic sequences.

Method: The proposed FOCUS module employs k-mer representations and a hierarchical compression mechanism to summarize and compress attention key-value activations progressively. It uses summary tokens and a shared-boundary windowing scheme to retain distant information efficiently.

Result: FOCUS achieves near-lossless compression of DNA contexts, enabling 100x reduction in memory usage and extending inference capabilities to significantly longer sequences while maintaining high fidelity in predictions.

Conclusion: FOCUS enables efficient and scalable modeling of ultra-long genomic sequences, making DNA LLMs more practical for real-world genomic studies and applications.

Abstract: Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental "grammar" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing tools to assist laypeople in articulating legal events and creating legal documents efficiently, bypassing challenges in textual articulation.

Method: Analyzed the performance of LLMs in summarizing and drafting legal documents based on 120 YouTube videos covering various legal issues.

Result: 71.7% of the generated summaries were rated as high or medium quality, indicating that LLMs show promise in legal summarization applications.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist in legal summarization tasks, providing potential benefits for access to justice and simplifying legal processes for non-experts.

Abstract: Understanding the legally relevant factual basis of an event and conveying it through text is a key skill of legal professionals. This skill is important for preparing forms (e.g., insurance claims) or other legal documents (e.g., court claims), but often presents a challenge for laypeople. Current AI approaches aim to bridge this gap, but mostly rely on the user to articulate what has happened in text, which may be challenging for many. Here, we investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and summarize events occurring in videos. We ask an LLM to summarize and draft legal letters, based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues in various domains. Overall, 71.7\% of the summaries were rated as of high or medium quality, which is a promising result, opening the door to a number of applications in e.g. access to justice.

TL;DR: TeleEMS is a mobile live video analytics system designed for emergency medical services (EMS), enabling pre-arrival multimodal inference through video and audio fusion while presenting significant advancements in analytics and communication capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current EMS infrastructure which struggle with one-to-one video streaming and lack advanced analytics, creating a high-stress environment for EMTs and dispatchers interpreting excessive or redundant data.

Method: TeleEMS comprises a client-server system. The client functions on multiple devices to assist bystanders and EMTs, while the server is equipped with EMS-Stream for multi-party streaming and three analytics modules: EMSLlama (audio-to-symptom analysis), state-of-the-art rPPG methods (video-to-vital analysis), and PreNet (multimodal decision-making).

Result: EMSLlama achieved superior performance over GPT-4o, and text-vital fusion enhanced inference reliability, leading to effective pre-arrival intervention guidance.

Conclusion: TeleEMS has the potential to revolutionize EMS operations by integrating advanced video analytics into a cohesive system, improving collaboration and decision-making among EMS staff and bystanders.

Abstract: Timely and accurate pre-arrival video streaming and analytics are critical for emergency medical services (EMS) to deliver life-saving interventions. Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.
  TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.
  Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure.

### [454] [MindCross: Fast New Subject Adaptation with Limited Data for Cross-subject Video Reconstruction from Brain Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14196)
*Xuan-Hao Liu,Yan-Kai Liu,Tianyi Zhou,Bao-Liang Lu,Wei-Long Zheng*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces MindCross, a cross-subject framework for reconstructing video from brain signals, addressing subject-specific and invariant information while enhancing adaptation to new subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of data scarcity and inefficient subject adaptation in decoding brain signals into videos.

Method: The framework, MindCross, employs specific encoders for subject-specific information, a shared encoder for invariant information, and a Top-K collaboration module for integrating learned knowledge.

Result: MindCross improves decoding efficacy and efficiency across subjects with minimal data requirements, demonstrated through extensive experiments with fMRI and EEG benchmarks.

Conclusion: MindCross provides a faster and data-efficient approach for cross-subject brain decoding, tackling existing limitations in subject adaptation.

Abstract: Reconstructing video from brain signals is an important brain decoding task. Existing brain decoding frameworks are primarily built on a subject-dependent paradigm, which requires large amounts of brain data for each subject. However, the expensive cost of collecting brain-video data causes severe data scarcity. Although some cross-subject methods being introduced, they often overfocus with subject-invariant information while neglecting subject-specific information, resulting in slow fine-tune-based adaptation strategy. To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders. Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks demonstrate MindCross's efficacy and efficiency of cross-subject decoding and new subject adaptation using only one model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the usability of recommender system interfaces is crucial for effective user experiences, but this process is time-consuming and requires expertise.

Method: Multimodal large language models were applied to analyze screenshots of various recommender system interfaces, considering usability criteria like preference elicitation and recommendation presentation.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that LLMs can perform heuristic-style usability assessments efficiently, offering explanatory feedback and improving scalability.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs can enhance the usability analysis process of recommender systems, enabling automation and scalability to strengthen user experience.

Abstract: Usability is a key factor in the effectiveness of recommender systems. However, the analysis of user interfaces is a time-consuming process that requires expertise. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to automate such evaluations. In this work, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs to assess the usability of recommender system interfaces by considering a variety of publicly available systems as examples. We take user interface screenshots from multiple of these recommender platforms to cover both preference elicitation and recommendation presentation scenarios. An LLM is instructed to analyze these interfaces with regard to different usability criteria and provide explanatory feedback. Our evaluation demonstrates how LLMs can support heuristic-style usability assessments at scale to support the improvement of user experience.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper compares AI with rule-based software from an engineering perspective, exploring its nature, limitations, and ethical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to differentiate AI’s capabilities and behavior from traditional rule-based software and to preserve the rationality of rule-based systems while ensuring AI is responsibly used for societal well-being.

Method: The paper proposes a methodology to classify and differentiate AI behaviors through three decision types, highlighting hidden or unobservable rules.

Result: The study provides a framework to discern AI behavior, aiding in humanly responsible and thoughtful usage of AI systems.

Conclusion: A clear understanding of AI behavior is essential to maintaining human responsibilities, ensuring AI soundness, and preserving societal, environmental, and human well-being.

Abstract: As a capability coming from computation, how does AI differ fundamentally from the capabilities delivered by rule-based software program? The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.

*Nick von Felten,Johannes Schöning,Klaus Opwis,Nicolas Scharowksi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the interaction of biases in AI and humans, focusing on class imbalance in AI and base rate neglect in humans. An online study revealed compounded biases in human-AI interactions impacting decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how biases in AI and humans (such as class imbalance and base rate neglect) interact and affect decision-making processes in human-AI interaction.

Method: A within-subject online study involving 46 participants who classified diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on balanced or unbalanced datasets.

Result: Class imbalance disrupted participants' reliance on AI, and compounded bias effects of AI and human base rate neglect were observed.

Conclusion: Mutually reinforcing biases in human-AI interactions exist. Further research should adopt an interactionist perspective to better understand and address these compounded bias effects.

Abstract: Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.
