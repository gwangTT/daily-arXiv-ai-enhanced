### [1] [Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03773)
*Zhaorun Chen,Zhuokai Zhao,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Qi Qi,Yifan Wu,Tarun Kalluri,Sara Cao,Yuanhao Xiong,Haibo Tong,Huaxiu Yao,Hengduo Li,Jiacheng Zhu,Xian Li,Dawn Song,Bo Li,Jason Weston,Dat Huynh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DreamGym introduces a framework for scalable reinforcement learning (RL) training using synthetic experiences instead of costly real-environment rollouts, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various test scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges in RL training such as expensive rollouts, inadequate task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity hinder scalable experience data collection.

Method: DreamGym utilizes a reasoning-based experience model for consistent state transitions and feedback, enriches learning with an experience replay buffer, and adapts tasks dynamically for online curriculum learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DreamGym's ability to outperform baselines by over 30% in non-RL-ready tasks and match state-of-the-art RL approaches in complex settings with reduced reliance on real-world interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym provides a scalable, efficient framework for RL training, enabling strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities and reducing the dependency on exhaustive real-world experience data.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

### [2] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on optimizing tokenization methods for assembly code by studying different tokenization models and their impacts on downstream tasks like function signature prediction. It identifies trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their impact on practical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization for assembly code is underexplored despite its importance in binary code analysis and downstream task performance.

Method: The paper evaluates intrinsic properties like efficiency, vocabulary compression, and fidelity of various tokenization models, and tests their effects using models like Llama 3.2, BERT, and BART.

Result: Tokenization choices were found to heavily influence downstream task performance, and intrinsic metrics are only partly predictive of these outcomes.

Conclusion: Insights from the study can aid in optimizing tokenization for assembly code, enhancing the robustness of Natural Language Model-based binary code analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

### [3] [To See or To Read: User Behavior Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03845)
*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates modality trade-offs for user-behavior reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), finding that image data representation enhances next-purchase prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how modality impacts the performance of MLLMs in sequential user-behavior reasoning, particularly in purchase predictions.

Method: Developed a benchmarking framework called BehaviorLens to compare textual and image-based representations of transaction data on six MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs demonstrated an impressive 87.5% improvement in next-purchase prediction accuracy when using image-based representations over textual ones, with no added computational cost.

Conclusion: Representing user-behavior data as images instead of text significantly boosts MLLMs' prediction performance, indicating the modality's critical role in reasoning applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [4] [KnowThyself: An Agentic Assistant for LLM Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03878)
*Suraj Prasai,Mengnan Du,Ying Zhang,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowThyself is an assistant that makes understanding large language models easier using a chat-based interface with visualizations and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for LLM interpretability are fragmented and technically demanding.

Method: Combining an orchestrator LLM, agent router, and visual explanation modules within a conversational workflow.

Result: Simplifies technical barriers and creates an extensible platform for model inspection.

Conclusion: KnowThyself provides an accessible and structured foundation for LLM interpretability.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [5] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper challenges the explanation of DKT's performance by showing that its effectiveness is due to modeling causal prerequisite relationships between knowledge components (KCs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and explainability of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) models used in educational research.

Method: The authors pruned exercise relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), trained DKT on causal subsets of the Assistments dataset, and extracted DAGs using DKT's learned representations to analyze its behavior.

Result: The findings reveal that DKT's strength lies in modeling causal relationships between KCs, rather than bidirectional relationships, with its predictive capabilities aligning with causal structures.

Conclusion: DKT's success is attributed to its ability to approximate causal dependencies between knowledge components, emphasizing the importance of causality in knowledge tracing models.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [6] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit bias towards values of certain countries despite variations in outputs influenced by prompt language and cultural perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study seeks to examine whether LLMs reflect cultural diversity in responses, amid training data and optimization biases.

Method: Probed 10 LLMs using 63 items from Hofstede and World Values Surveys in 11 languages with distinct cultural perspectives in prompts.

Result: Prompt language and cultural perspective influence responses but models show systematic bias towards values of Netherlands, Germany, US, and Japan.

Conclusion: LLMs show variation with prompting but remain anchored to restricted cultural defaults, limiting their representation of global diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [7] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot addresses limitations in LLM-based ML engineering by using a multi-agent system combining architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search, minimizing reliance on full training runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based systems for ML engineering are computationally expensive and slow due to reliance on repeated full training runs for solution evaluation.

Method: A multi-agent system called ArchPilot is introduced, involving three agents: orchestration agent (using a novel MCTS-inspired algorithm), generation agent (for architecture refinement), and evaluation agent (performing proxy training and score aggregation).

Result: ArchPilot shows superior performance on MLE-Bench compared to current state-of-the-art methods like AIDE and ML-Master.

Conclusion: ArchPilot reduces computational overhead and offers efficient ML engineering within budget constraints through advanced multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

### [8] [Detecting Silent Failures in Multi-Agentic AI Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04032)
*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on identifying silent failures in Multi-Agentic AI systems using anomaly detection and provides curated datasets and benchmarks for better research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of non-determinism and silent failures in Multi-Agentic AI systems.

Method: Develop anomaly detection techniques, create a data collection pipeline, and curate benchmark datasets with labeled trajectories.

Result: Benchmark datasets were created with 4,275 and 894 trajectories, achieving anomaly detection accuracies of up to 98% with supervised XGBoost and 96% with semi-supervised SVDD.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights and tools for improving the reliability and monitoring of Multi-Agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

### [9] [Interpreting Multi-Attribute Confounding through Numerical Attributes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04053)
*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how numerical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) is impacted by latent subspaces and contextual perturbations, identifying systematic amplification of correlations and vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying representational mechanisms behind numerical reasoning errors in large language models.

Method: Using linear probing, partial correlation analysis, and prompt-based vulnerability tests to study numerical representations and perturbations across different model sizes.

Result: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but amplify them, and irrelevant numerical context induces consistent shifts in magnitude representations with varying downstream effects by model size.

Conclusion: The paper highlights vulnerabilities in LLM decision-making and advocates for representation-aware controls under multi-attribute entanglement.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [10] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agentmandering, a turn-based negotiation framework for redistricting based on strategic interaction through LLM agents to reduce partisan bias and improve fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for redistricting neglect the strategic dynamics of selection, enabling biased manipulation despite technical compliance with legal constraints.

Method: The authors propose Agentmandering, modeled as a turn-based negotiation using large language model agents to select and freeze districts iteratively, embedding game-theoretic strategies.

Result: Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias, improves fairness, and achieves lower variance compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated using post-2020 U.S. Census data.

Conclusion: Agentmandering provides a more fair and stable redistricting method, particularly valuable in swing-state scenarios.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Lihaogx/AgentMandering.

### [11] [KGFR: A Foundation Retriever for Generalized Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04093)
*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-KGFR, combining large language models (LLMs) with a knowledge graph retriever for scalable and generalized reasoning on large/unseen graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models lack sufficient mechanisms for knowledge-intensive reasoning due to limited context and parametric knowledge, prompting a need to integrate structured retrieval systems.

Method: LLM-KGFR integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR) that uses descriptions generated by LLMs and introduces Asymmetric Progressive Propagation for scalable graph retrieval while maintaining efficient reasoning.

Result: Experiments show that LLM-KGFR achieves efficient and robust reasoning, scalability, and generalization to unseen knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for enhanced reasoning in knowledge-intensive tasks while overcoming limitations of dataset-specific tuning and scalability challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

### [12] [Testing the Testers: Human-Driven Quality Assessment of Voice AI Testing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04133)
*Miguel E. Andres,Vadim Fedorov,Rida Sadek,Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga,Nadescha Trudel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-centered benchmarking framework for evaluating the reliability of voice AI testing platforms, addressing simulation and evaluation quality problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice AI systems are increasingly deployed; however, methods for reliable testing of these systems remain underdeveloped, and organizations face challenges assessing the effectiveness of existing testing platforms.

Method: The authors developed a framework using psychometric techniques, statistical validations, and human judgments to evaluate test conversation realism and agent response accuracy.

Result: Validation of the framework revealed significant differences in performance among platforms. Evalion scored the highest in evaluation quality (f1-score of 0.92) and simulation quality (0.61), compared to other platforms.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic validation of voice AI testing platforms, supporting quality measurement for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [13] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the concept of assisting multiple humans in a shared AI environment using an empowerment-based objective, highlighting potential challenges like disempowerment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and address the limitations of empowerment, a universal goal-agnostic objective, in multi-human AI assistance settings, particularly in environments like homes and hospitals.

Method: The authors introduced a gridworld test suite called Disempower-Grid and empirically analyzed the behavior of agents optimizing one human's empowerment in multi-human contexts.

Result: The study found that optimizing for one individual's empowerment can significantly reduce another individual's influence and rewards, a situation termed disempowerment.

Conclusion: While joint empowerment can mitigate disempowerment, it comes at the cost of reduced rewards, highlighting the need for further exploration of goal-agnostic objectives in multi-agent contexts.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

### [14] [Opus: A Quantitative Framework for Workflow Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04220)
*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a model for assessing Workflow quality and efficiency based on probabilistic measures of correctness, reliability, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of effectively quantifying and optimizing Workflow quality and efficiency in automation systems.

Method: The authors introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model to assess expected performance and Opus Workflow Normative Penalties to measure Workflow quality in terms of structural, semantic, and signal properties.

Result: A unified optimization framework is developed to rank and identify optimal Workflows by balancing rewards and penalties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides tools for automated Workflow assessment, optimization, and discovery, with potential integration into Reinforcement Learning systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

### [15] [Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235)
*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent predictive coding framework to minimize mutual uncertainty and improve spatial memory and coordination in systems with limited communication bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-agent systems caused by partial observability and limited bandwidth, leading to failures in coordination.

Method: A grid-cell-inspired spatial coding metric is used for self-localization, combined with an information bottleneck objective to enhance communication efficiency. Hierarchical reinforcement learning is employed to reduce mutual uncertainty actively.

Result: On the Memory-Maze benchmark, the proposed approach displayed high robustness against bandwidth limitations, maintaining significant performance compared to a baseline with full broadcasting.

Conclusion: The work provides a biologically plausible and theoretically sound model for developing social representations, fostering collective intelligence in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

### [16] [RLoop: An Self-Improving Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Policy Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04285)
*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores issues in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). It proposes RLoop, a self-improving framework, to enhance training dynamics and mitigate overfitting while improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the challenge of RL overfitting, where models achieve training rewards but fail to generalize effectively due to policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting during conventional training processes.

Method: RLoop is introduced as a framework with iterative policy initialization. It combines exploration via RL and exploitation through Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) of expert trajectories to refine the policy iteratively.

Result: RLoop substantially improves generalization, reduces forgetting, increases average accuracy by 9%, and boosts pass@32 by over 15% compared to standard RL.

Conclusion: RLoop effectively addresses RL overfitting by leveraging iterative learning cycles to transform transient policy diversity into lasting improvements in model performance.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-360° introduces a large-scale dataset and benchmark suite for computer-using agents (CUAs), providing multi-modal trajectories and addressing gaps in real-world tasks, automated annotation, and unified benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent gaps in CUA development, including the lack of real-world tasks, automated annotation, and an integrated benchmark for evaluating GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.

Method: An LLM-augmented pipeline facilitates query sourcing, template creation, task execution, and quality filtering, generating over 1.2M action steps across trajectories with screenshots, metadata, goal planning, reasoning traces, and various trajectories.

Result: Benchmark evaluations show that state-of-the-art models struggle with grounding and action prediction tasks, gaining improvements through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning but still underperforming compared to human reliability.

Conclusion: GUI-360° provides a robust foundation to improve CUAs, offering datasets, benchmarks, and tools for reproducible research and further progress in desktop-based agent design and functioning.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) in explainable AI, presenting a new method and metrics to better align probes with intended concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unreliability of using probe accuracy as an indicator of concept alignment in CAVs, highlighting potential spurious correlations over accurate representation.

Method: A novel concept localization method using spatial linear attribution was introduced, alongside the development of three metrics (hard accuracy, segmentation scores, augmentation robustness) to evaluate concept alignment.

Result: It was demonstrated that standard probes are prone to spurious correlations while deliberately misaligned probes can achieve comparable accuracy. The research showed that alignment-focused probes enhance accuracy and spatial consistency.

Conclusion: Current probe accuracy fails to ensure concept alignment in CAVs. Alignment-based evaluation metrics and architecture-specific probes are essential for accurately capturing intended concepts.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Motivation: Existing research on LLM safety and robustness is fragmented, hindering reproducibility, comparability, and meaningful advancements in the field.

Method: The study introduces AdversariaLLM, a framework integrating 12 adversarial attack algorithms, 7 benchmark datasets, and multiple open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. It emphasizes advanced features like compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation.

Result: AdversariaLLM provides a comprehensive, extensible, and robust platform to conduct reproducible research on LLM safety and robustness.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM establishes a strong and transparent foundation for improving research in LLM safety, helping decrease fragmentation and enhance reproducibility across studies.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

*Jiahao Zhao,Luxin Xu,Minghuan Tan,Lichao Zhang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes RxSafeBench, a benchmark framework to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on medication safety in simulated clinical settings. Current LLMs struggle with contraindication and interaction knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on the medication safety of LLM-powered medical systems due to the lack of accessible real-world datasets and evaluations focused on clinical consultations.

Method: The paper develops RxSafeBench, which includes simulated clinical dialogues and the RxRisk DB database covering contraindications, drug interactions, and indication-drug pairs. The framework employs multiple-choice evaluations for testing medication recommendations.

Result: The study reveals that current LLMs face challenges in addressing medication safety issues, underperforming in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding of risks and interactions.

Conclusion: RxSafeBench provides an essential benchmark for medication safety evaluation in LLMs, highlighting the need for improved modeling approaches, better prompting strategies, and task-specific optimization for AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

### [21] [Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV):Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341)
*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework to address deficiencies in current test-time reasoning models by integrating metacognitive monitoring, aiming to improve reasoning accuracy without empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time reasoning models, such as the Generate-Verify paradigm, suffer from a prefix dominance trap, where models commit to suboptimal reasoning paths early. This leads to significant accuracy losses, highlighting the need for better monitoring of reasoning processes.

Method: The paper formalizes metacognitive theories by Flavell and Nelson & Narens into computational specifications, proposing the MGV framework. This framework integrates explicit monitoring before generation to capture metrics like difficulty assessments and confidence judgments, and refines these processes using verification feedback.

Result: No empirical validation has been presented, but the work provides a systematic computational translation of metacognitive theories, offering insights into reasoning system failures and possible architectural improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed MGV framework fills a critical architectural gap in reasoning models by incorporating metacognitive monitoring and offers a principled approach to understanding system failures and enhancing test-time reasoning designs for future research.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [22] [Post-Training LLMs as Better Decision-Making Agents: A Regret-Minimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04393)
*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT) as a post-training method to enhance large language models (LLMs) in decision-making scenarios. Iterative RMFT uses model-generated reasoning and regret metrics to improve decision trajectories, showing better performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used for decision-making in dynamic settings despite limitations in their ability to achieve low regret or balance exploration and exploitation effectively. The paper aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: The authors propose Iterative RMFT, where the model generates multiple decision trajectories, selects those with the lowest regret, and fine-tunes itself on these examples iteratively, relying on regret metrics rather than manual engineering.

Result: Iterative RMFT improves decision-making performance across diverse models and tasks, including both open-weight and advanced closed-weight models, showing its adaptability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT is a principled and flexible post-training framework that boosts the decision-making abilities of LLMs, generalizes across tasks, and has theoretical grounding in regret minimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [23] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRPO is simplified but flawed when adapting LLMs to specific tasks with richer ordinal rewards. CoRPO resolves these issues by adjusting the baseline to prevent positive reinforcement of failed solutions and drive optimal results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable LLMs to adapt and learn new capabilities through reinforcement learning using richer, multi-dimensional feedback.

Method: Introduce CoRPO, which enforces a minimum quality threshold and uses an adaptive baseline to optimize behavior in RL tasks based on ordinal rewards.

Result: CoRPO showed stable convergence and improved out-of-domain generalization on a code verification task.

Conclusion: CoRPO solves flaws in GRPO by leveraging richer feedback mechanisms, advancing reinforcement learning methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PAVe, a system that combines traditional routing algorithms with language model-based reasoning for personalized vehicle routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vehicle routing systems fail to accommodate complex human contexts, such as multi-step tasks or situational constraints, limiting their adaptability and interpretive capabilities for real-world urban driving scenarios.

Method: The authors designed PAVe, integrating multi-objective Dijkstra algorithms with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent to evaluate routes based on user tasks and preferences, supported by a geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest.

Result: PAVe achieved over 88% accuracy in selecting initial routes based on complex user intents in realistic urban scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Combining traditional routing methods with LLM-based semantic reasoning provides a scalable, personalized, and adaptive solution for urban mobility challenges.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

*Lars Krupp,Daniel Geißler,Vishal Banwari,Paul Lukowicz,Jakob Karolus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the environmental costs of web agents by analyzing their energy and $CO_2$ impacts both theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on web agents focuses on capabilities but largely ignores sustainability implications, despite their growing energy demands.

Method: The authors estimate and empirically benchmark the energy and $CO_2$ costs of web agents while critiquing transparency issues in model disclosures.

Result: Different web agent design philosophies greatly influence energy consumption, and higher energy usage does not always lead to better outcomes.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for metrics to measure energy usage in web agent evaluations and emphasizes the importance of transparency in energy consumption disclosure.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how well large language models (LLMs) replicate human behavior in decision-making experiments, specifically through a game-theoretic lens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how closely LLMs mirror human decision-making, bridging the gap between harmful misalignments and effective social simulations.

Method: A digital twin of game-theoretic experiments was created, combined with systematic prompting and probing for evaluating machine behavior.

Result: Llama replicated human cooperation patterns accurately, Qwen aligned with Nash equilibrium predictions, and the study succeeded in generating testable hypotheses for unexplored experimental setups.

Conclusion: Calibrated LLMs can mirror aggregate human behaviors, offering a tool for exploring social and behavioral sciences and generating new predictions about human decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven sparse sensing framework to optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in urban drainage networks under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban surface water flooding due to intense rainfall requires precise high-resolution monitoring and prediction, but practical constraints like time and budget limit its implementation.

Method: A data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework is introduced, which integrates a SWMM model, uses singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction, and QR factorization for selecting optimal sensor locations.

Result: Three sensors optimally placed across a network of 77 nodes achieved high reconstruction performance with NSE values of 0.92-0.95, while exhibiting robustness to measurement uncertainties and sensor failures.

Conclusion: The DSS framework offers an efficient solution for flow monitoring in urban drainage systems, balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and resource constraints. It holds potential for integration in flood early warning and real-time control systems.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

### [29] [Are We Asking the Right Questions? On Ambiguity in Natural Language Queries for Tabular Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04584)
*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that distinguishes between cooperative and uncooperative queries for natural language interfaces to tabular data, reshaping how ambiguity is viewed and addressed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by inherent ambiguities in natural language queries when applied to tabular data.

Method: The authors introduce a structured framework for distinguishing cooperative (resolvable) queries from uncooperative (unresolvable) ones, analyzing 15 popular datasets to identify shortcomings in current evaluations of tabular question answering systems.

Result: The study uncovers issues in the mixed treatment of query types in popular datasets and argues that this may compromise the evaluation of both execution accuracy and interpretation capabilities of systems.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for embracing cooperative interactions to manage ambiguity, suggesting that future system designs should focus on cooperative resolution processes and appropriate evaluation metrics for natural language interfaces to tabular data.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

### [30] [Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588)
*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an auditing framework to measure question representation in deliberative processes using justified representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve question selection in deliberative processes and ensure broader participant representation.

Method: Developed algorithms for auditing justified representation, including efficient ones with specific runtime complexity, and applied them to historical deliberations using different question selection methods.

Result: The auditing methods revealed differences in representativeness among moderator-chosen, algorithm-selected, and LLM-generated questions, demonstrating both potential and limitations of LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework and tools contribute to enhancing representation in deliberative processes, applicable globally via an online platform.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

### [31] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for multi-agent cooperative planning, which enhances task completion and efficiency through a symbolic planning approach and dynamic world modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of cooperative multi-agent planning under partial information and limited communication, where trajectory-level coordination often fails due to cascading conflicts from small deviations.

Method: The method involves a two-phase negotiation protocol where agents propose and commit to roles under constraints, followed by independent symbolic plan generation. A shared dynamic world model updates execution outcomes, enabling agents to reason over symbolic plans instead of raw trajectories.

Result: Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks demonstrate that DR. WELL improves collaboration, task completion rates, and efficiency, offering adaptable and reusable planning strategies through negotiation and self-refinement.

Conclusion: DR. WELL, by focusing on reasoning over symbolic plans and employing a shared world model, successfully addresses robustness and collaboration challenges in multi-agent systems, trading a time overhead for more effective and efficient strategies.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

### [32] [VeriCoT: Neuro-symbolic Chain-of-Thought Validation via Logical Consistency Checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662)
*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeriCoT, a neuro-symbolic method to verify the logical validity of reasoning in LLMs. It achieves formalization through first-order logic, enabling identification of flawed reasoning and serving as a predictor for answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of LLMs to verify the logical validity of their own reasoning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios, where flawed reasoning can undermine trust.

Method: VeriCoT extracts reasoning steps from LLM-generated outputs, formalizes them into first-order logic, and uses automated solvers to verify their validity. It incorporates human review of natural language premises and enables self-reflection, supervised fine-tuning, and preference fine-tuning for improvement.

Result: Experiments demonstrated VeriCoT's effectiveness in identifying flawed reasoning within datasets like ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ, improving accuracy and stability in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VeriCoT offers a reliable mechanism for validating and refining reasoning in LLMs, enhancing their utility and trustworthiness in domains requiring logical rigor.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

### [33] [From Minutes to Seconds: Redefining the Five-Minute Rule for AI-Era Memory Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03944)
*Tong Zhang,Vikram Sharma Mailthody,Fei Sun,Linsen Ma,Chris J. Newburn,Teresa Zhang,Yang Liu,Jiangpeng Li,Hao Zhong,Wen-Mei Hwu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper revisits the five-minute rule for storing data in DRAM or storage, adapting it for modern AI platforms and proposing a workload-aware framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The five-minute rule was originally proposed to guide decisions on data storage in DRAM versus storage based only on economics, but modern systems introduce challenges such as host costs, workload behavior, and new hardware capabilities.

Method: The authors revisit the rule using physics-grounded models, workload-aware approaches, and include host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and SSD performance. They develop MQSim-Next for simulation and validation.

Result: The original caching threshold collapses from minutes to seconds for modern GPU-centric AI platforms paired with high-performance SSDs, reconfiguring NAND flash memory as an active data tier.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable provisioning guidance, introduces MQSim-Next, and showcases case studies. It transforms the heuristic into a feasibility-aware memory analysis framework, suggesting future research directions for AI-era memory hierarchies.

Abstract: In 1987, Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu introduced the five-minute rule, a
simple, storage-memory-economics-based heuristic for deciding when data should
live in DRAM rather than on storage. Subsequent revisits to the rule largely
retained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and
workload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first
principles, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and
physics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these
elements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable
provisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially
GPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained
random access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a
few seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and
exposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further
introduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and
sensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research.
Finally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system
design space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a
classical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and
provisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory
hierarchy.

Abstract: This paper presents a 3D-stacked chiplets based large language model (LLM)
inference accelerator, consisting of non-volatile in-memory-computing
processing elements (PEs) and Inter-PE Computational Network (IPCN),
interconnected via silicon photonic to effectively address the communication

and $30\times$ efficiency improvement over the Nvidia A100 before chiplet
clustering and power gating scheme (CCPG). Additionally, the system achieves
further scalability and efficiency improvement with the implementation of CCPG
to accommodate larger models, attaining $57\times$ efficiency improvement over
Nvidia H100 at similar throughput.

Result: The study sheds light on the potential transformative effects of hardware disaggregation, particularly in reshaping data center operations and systems.

Conclusion: Hardware disaggregation offers promising opportunities to revolutionize data center ecosystems, though challenges remain to be addressed, as highlighted through examples and numerical studies.

Abstract: Hardware disaggregation seeks to transform Data Center (DC) resources from
traditional server fleets into unified resource pools. Despite existing
challenges that may hinder its full realization, significant progress has been
made in both industry and academia. In this article, we provide an overview of
the motivations and recent advancements in hardware disaggregation. We further
discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with disaggregated
architectures, focusing on aspects that have received limited attention. We
argue that hardware disaggregation has the potential to reshape the entire DC
ecosystem, impacting application design, resource scheduling, hardware
configuration, cooling, and power system optimization. Additionally, we present
a numerical study to illustrate several key aspects of these challenges.

*Yuanpeng Zhang,Xing Hu,Xi Chen,Zhihang Yuan,Cong Li,Jingchen Zhu,Zhao Wang,Chenguang Zhang,Xin Si,Wei Gao,Qiang Wu,Runsheng Wang,Guangyu Sun*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper addresses IR-drop issues in high-performance SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) through a software and hardware co-design approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate severe IR-drop issues in SRAM PIM, which hinder performance, reliability, and necessitate resource-intensive conventional solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a co-design solution named AIM, incorporating workload analysis (Rtog and HR), architecture-level IR-drop mitigation (LHR and WDS), dynamic adjustment mechanism (IR-Booster), and an HR-aware task mapping method.

Result: Post-layout simulation of a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip revealed up to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, improving energy efficiency by 2.29x and speed by 1.152x.

Conclusion: AIM successfully addresses IR-drop issues in PIM, achieving significant improvements in performance and efficiency through architectural software and hardware co-design.

Abstract: SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising
implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density,
energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher
performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating
frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly
degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional
circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are
resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To
address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware
co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.
Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties
of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between
PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,
enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while
maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,
we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates
software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt
the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and
performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging
software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout
simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up
to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement
and 1.152x speedup.

### [38] [Activation-Space Personality Steering: Hybrid Layer Selection for Stable Trait Control in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03738)
*Pranav Bhandari,Nicolas Fay,Sanjeevan Selvaganapathy,Amitava Datta,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline for extracting and utilizing personality traits within Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and steer their behavior effectively, using the Big Five Personality framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit implicit personality traits during text generation, but controlling these traits to align with specific requirements remains challenging. There is a need for effective mechanisms to manipulate the behavior of LLMs, which this study addresses.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline that uses the Big Five Personality Traits and applies low-rank subspace discovery methods to identify optimal layers in LLM architectures for injecting personality-aligned directions. A flexible steering framework with dynamic layer selection enables control over trait expression.

Result: The study reveals that personality traits occupy a low-rank shared subspace within LLMs, and perturbing these structures can steer their behavior effectively without affecting fluency, variability, or general capabilities.

Conclusion: Personality traits within LLMs can be transformed into practical mechanisms for behavioral alignment, bridging psychological theory with model alignment in AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

TL;DR: TextualVerifier improves TextGrad optimization and reasoning reliability with LLM-based self-verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of self-verification mechanisms in text-based decision making for composite AI systems like TextGrad.

Method: TextualVerifier utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation as a four-stage workflow integrated non-invasively with TextGrad.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in reasoning validity and optimization results with moderate overhead when TextualVerifier is applied.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier provides a novel LLM-based verification framework for TextGrad, enhancing optimization reliability without requiring numerical gradients.

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Motivation: To address the limited support for non-English languages in large language models and develop an open-source, high-quality, and culturally relevant LLM for Polish, strengthening AI sovereignty.

Method: Built using a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus, a 77k instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. Includes Responsible AI framework and a hybrid module for output safety.

Result: Developed a family of Polish language models equipped for tasks like public administration, detailing model architecture, training, and alignment.

Conclusion: PLLuM promotes open research and enhances Polish-specific AI technologies for national and cultural needs, mitigating the English-centric AI landscape.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI

### [42] [STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03827)
*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces STARS, an efficient decoding-time algorithm to align large language models with human values, outperforming traditional methods and reducing computational expenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of aligning large language models with human values by overcoming computational inefficiencies and suboptimal results of traditional methods such as fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling.

Method: The proposed method, STARS (Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling), iteratively samples, scores, and either rejects or accepts short token segments during model generation to ensure better alignment and computational efficiency.

Result: The method demonstrates significant improvement in alignment quality, outperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning by up to 14.9 points and Direct Preference Optimization by up to 4.3 points. It is also competitive with Best-of-N baselines.

Conclusion: STARS establishes itself as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative for aligning large language models without the heavy computational expenses associated with traditional methods.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

*Mikołaj Langner,Jan Eliasz,Ewa Rudnicka,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient multi-label text classification method for large language models using dichotomic decision sequences, independent label querying, prefix caching, and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in multi-label text classification with large language models while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Method: Reformulating classification tasks into dichotomic yes/no decisions for independent querying of target labels. Utilizes prefix caching and LLM-to-SLM distillation to optimize performance.

Result: Demonstrated improved performance and efficiency, particularly on training-seen dimensions, with fine-tuned models exceeding zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a scalable and effective solution for LLM-based multi-label classification, applicable across domains and validated on affective text analysis with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the quality of Machine Translation datasets for three low-resourced languages, revealing gender biases and harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight risks in prioritizing dataset size over quality for low-resourced languages, such as poor performance and societal biases.

Method: The authors investigated MT datasets for Afan Oromo, Amharic, and Tigrinya, focusing on gender representation and biases.

Result: The analysis revealed male gender skew, stereotypical depictions, and toxic content within datasets, especially in larger datasets.

Conclusion: Quantity does not guarantee quality in datasets; the study urges further inquiry and mitigation of biases in low-resourced language datasets.

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRAD, a decoding-time method aimed at mitigating hallucination in large language models by leveraging evidence from corpus-derived token transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the ongoing challenge of hallucination in large language models, which persists even with increased model scaling.

Method: Proposes a Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD) technique that grounds generation in corpus-derived evidence using sparse token transition graphs, avoiding retraining and integrating seamlessly during decoding.

Result: GRAD surpasses baseline methods across various question-answering benchmarks, improving intrinsic accuracy by up to 9.7%, reducing hallucination rates by 8.6%, and increasing correctness by 6.9%, while maintaining fluency and truthfulness.

Conclusion: GRAD offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative to existing methods, demonstrating that leveraging statistical evidence from corpora can steer language models towards more factual outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

*Alvin Wei Ming Tan,Ben Prystawski,Veronica Boyce,Michael C. Frank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores iterated reference games to evaluate the pragmatic reasoning ability of humans vs vision-language models in multi-turn linguistic contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how humans and models handle context-sensitive communication and adapt to changing scenarios in reference games.

Method: Iterated reference games with varying context features (amount, order, relevance). Testing performance of humans and vision-language models.

Result: Models performed worse than humans without relevant context, but improved significantly with appropriate context.

Conclusion: Vision-language models still struggle with abstract referents, but relevant context greatly improves their multi-turn reasoning performance.

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI) which analyzes over 2.6 billion U.S. tweets using AI models to measure human flourishing indicators at fine spatial and temporal detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of measuring societal well-being beyond economic indicators lack high spatial and temporal resolution, necessitating a new approach.

Method: Researchers analyzed geolocated U.S. tweets from 2013-2023 using fine-tuned large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators related to human flourishing.

Result: The study provides county- and state-level monthly and yearly indicators of flourishing validated for accuracy and correlations with existing measures.

Conclusion: The HFGI dataset enables deep analysis of well-being and social change, offering insights into human flourishing via social media discourse.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at
unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human
flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States
over the past decade.

### [48] [Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models via Vector Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03945)
*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for enabling semantic communication between large language models (LLMs) by translating latent representations, demonstrating improved communication and collaborative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and constraints of communication between LLMs, where messages are typically passed as plain tokens, losing latent semantic information and increasing computational overhead.

Method: The authors use a dual-encoder translator to map latent vector representations between different large language models (Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct), achieving semantic exchange via latent vector translations.

Result: The approach achieves an average cosine alignment score of 0.538 and enables injecting translated vectors with a 30 percent blending strength to guide the target model's output without destabilizing computations. The method exhibits a transfer asymmetry of 2.01:1.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates the feasibility of cross-model latent communication, allowing AI systems to exchange meaning directly through latent representations and opening possibilities for more efficient and collaborative multi-agent AI systems.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

*Shiyin Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating abductive inference into retrieval-augmented large language models to handle reasoning failures caused by incomplete evidence, enhancing accuracy and reasoning faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation systems often fail due to gaps in evidence, highlighting the need for better handling of incomplete information in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Method: The framework focuses on detecting evidence insufficiency, generating plausible missing premises using abductive inference, and validating them via consistency and plausibility checks.

Result: Experimental results indicate improved accuracy and reasoning faithfulness on benchmarks for abductive reasoning and multi-hop question answering.

Conclusion: Abductive inference significantly enhances the robustness and explainability of retrieval-augmented generation systems, presenting a promising path forward for their development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Weakly Supervised Transducer (WST) to handle ASR tasks with high transcription error rates without relying on expensive annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems heavily rely on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are costly and challenging to acquire.

Method: The paper introduces WST, incorporating a flexible training graph to handle transcription errors without needing confidence estimation or pre-trained models.

Result: Empirical evaluations show WST effectively sustains performance despite transcription error rates of up to 70%, outperforming existing CTC-based methods.

Conclusion: WST demonstrates robust and practical utility in ASR applications with transcription errors and will be made publicly available for broader adoption.

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents T-FIX, a benchmark for evaluating LLM explanations' alignment with expert judgment in knowledge-intensive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for meaningful explanations from LLMs when operating in knowledge-intensive scenarios requiring alignment with expert-level reasoning.

Method: The authors introduced T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven domains, and collaborated with experts to create metrics for evaluating LLM explanations' alignment with expert intuition.

Result: The authors established formal metrics and a benchmark to assess the alignment of LLM explanations with expert judgment, enabling better evaluation methods.

Conclusion: Evaluating explanations based on expert alignment is crucial, especially in knowledge-intensive domains. The proposed T-FIX benchmark provides a structured approach to improve this evaluation process.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses TKGQA by introducing the PoK framework, combining enhanced temporal knowledge retrieval and structured question planning to improve Large Language Models' reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the challenges in TKGQA, where previous methods fail to understand complex semantics of time constraints, and LLMs struggle with temporal reasoning, hallucinations, and limited knowledge.

Method: The authors created the PoK framework that includes a Plan of Knowledge module to decompose complex temporal questions and a Temporal Knowledge Store (TKS) using contrastive retrieval for enhancing understanding and precision.

Result: The proposed PoK framework significantly improves retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy in TKGQA, achieving a 56.0% performance increase compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Combining structured planning and enhanced temporal knowledge retrieval with the PoK framework markedly improves LLMs' interpretability and factual alignment in answering temporal questions.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

*Špela Vintar,Jan Jona Javoršek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares human word associations with large language models (LLMs) and finds LLMs moderately overlap with humans but amplify emotional stimuli and are less creative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models' word associations compare to human responses, especially regarding emotional stimuli.

Method: The study analyzed responses to emotionally charged words, comparing associations from human participants and large language models.

Result: LLMs have moderate overlap with human associations, amplify emotional content more, and are less creative and predictable.

Conclusion: While LLMs mimic human associative thinking moderately well, they lack the complexity and creativity characteristic of human cognition.

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: The study improves automated de-identification of radiology reports using transformer-based models and shows superior performance against state-of-the-art and commercial systems for protected health information detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for more robust and accurate methods of automating the removal of sensitive personal information (PHI) from radiology reports for data privacy.

Method: A transformer-based PHI de-identification pipeline was fine-tuned using large radiology datasets. An additional PHI category (AGE) was introduced, and the model's performance was benchmarked against datasets from different institutions and commercial systems.

Result: The model achieved high F1 scores (0.973-0.996) on test datasets and consistently outperformed previous state-of-the-art and commercial systems.

Conclusion: The multimodal, transformer-based de-identification approach improves accuracy, robustness, and cross-institutional generalization for PHI removal in clinical text while preserving data utility.

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [55] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits the problem of language identification in the limit with a novel focus on list identification, where the learner can provide multiple guesses. It provides characterizations of the collections of languages that are identifiable with $k$-lists and establishes exponential rates for successful identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and expand the classical problem of language identification by exploring the power of multi-guess ($k$-list based) learning, addressing limitations in Gold's and Angluin's early results.

Method: The authors present a recursive extension of Angluin's characterization for $k$-list identifications and analyze the problem under both deterministic and statistical identification settings.

Result: The paper provides an exact characterization of $k$-list identifiable language collections and proves that identifiability ensures exponential rates of success while non-identifiability leads to no converging rates of success.

Conclusion: The study broadens the understanding of language collections identifiable through multiple guesses ($k$-lists) and highlights the conditions under which such identification is feasible and efficient.

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

*Wenmo Qiu,Saurabh Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Batch prompting in large language models enhances reasoning reliability, reduces token usage, and improves accuracy across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether batch prompting in large language models can serve as a regularizer for reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Method: A comprehensive evaluation using 13 different benchmarks to study the effects of batch prompting on token usage, accuracy, and model behavior.

Result: Batch prompting reduces overthinking, hedging language, encourages decisive answers, minimizes token usage (by 3x-5x), and improves accuracy. Collective effects in solving harder problems within the same batch are observed.

Conclusion: Batching not only optimizes throughput but acts as a valuable inference-time regularizer, enhancing efficiency and reliability in multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs on mathematical reasoning may overestimate their capabilities due to issues like training data leakage and superficial pattern matching. There’s a lack of standard, rigorous methods for assessing question difficulty and robust reasoning.

Method: The proposed RIDE framework uses Item Response Theory (IRT) and reinforcement learning to generate challenging, well-posed variations of math problems, guided by performance data from 35 LLMs. It involves a difficulty ranker from LLM responses to ensure systematic difficulty scaling.

Result: RIDE-generated math problems led to an average performance decrease of 21.73% across 26 tested LLMs on mathematical reasoning, revealing weaknesses and limited robustness in the models’ reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RIDE is an effective tool for creating challenging, well-posed benchmarks, providing a more realistic assessment of LLMs' mathematical reasoning and exposing their limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

### [58] [CantoASR: Prosody-Aware ASR-LALM Collaboration for Low-Resource Cantonese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04139)
*Dazhong Chen,Yi-Cheng Lin,Yuchen Huang,Ziwei Gong,Di Jiang,Zeying Xie,Yi R.,Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CantoASR, a novel framework combining ASR models and LALMs to improve Cantonese speech recognition, addressing challenges like tones, tone sandhi, and accents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by low-resource Cantonese ASR, which struggles with limited annotated data, lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variations, resulting in high word error rates in existing models.

Method: The proposed method introduces CantoASR: 1) Uses forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, 2) LoRA-finetuned Whisper for better tone discrimination, and 3) Instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware error correction.

Result: Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data showed significant improvements in Character Error Rate (CER) compared to Whisper-Large-V3.

Conclusion: Integrating acoustic cues with broad LALM contextual reasoning is an effective and scalable approach for improving ASR performance in low-resource tonal and dialectal languages such as Cantonese.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents three multi-agent LLM pipelines to improve SQL generation performance and benchmarks their effectiveness across different model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in SQL generation for large schema sizes and complex reasoning, particularly focusing on smaller, efficient LLMs.

Method: Three multi-agent LLM pipelines are proposed: Multi-agent Discussion, Planner-Coder, and Coder-Aggregator, each utilizing systematic collaboration among models for SQL generation.

Result: Experiments showed up to a 10.6% execution accuracy improvement for Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct using Multi-Agent discussion and the highest score of 56.4% accuracy for Gemma 3 27B IT seen with the Reasoner-Coder pipeline.

Conclusion: Multi-agent collaboration enhances SQL generation performance in smaller LLMs, and the Reasoner-Coder pipeline shows the most significant improvement. Open-source implementation is provided for use and further development.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

### [60] [Trustworthy LLM-Mediated Communication: Evaluating Information Fidelity in LLM as a Communicator (LAAC) Framework in Multiple Application Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04184)
*Mohammed Musthafa Rafi,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI-generated content often leads to inefficient communication as it inflates ideas only to be summarized again. LAAC proposes using LLMs as intermediaries for authentic content exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motiviation lies in resolving the inefficiency and lack of authenticity caused by the cycle of inflating and compressing AI-generated content.

Method: LAAC introduces structured dialogue and evaluates three dimensions: fidelity in information capture, reproducibility across interactions, and integrity of recipient-facing responses.

Result: Controlled experiments highlighted trust issues in fidelity, reproducibility, and integrity, demonstrating measurable gaps in deploying LAAC in critical communication.

Conclusion: LAAC offers a promising alternative for authentic exchanges, but critical trust gaps need to be addressed for reliable deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

### [61] [Computational Turing Test Reveals Systematic Differences Between Human and AI Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195)
*Nicolò Pagan,Petter Törnberg,Christopher A. Bail,Anikó Hannák,Christopher Barrie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a computational Turing test to assess how closely large language models (LLMs) simulate human-like text, finding that even calibrated models remain distinguishable from human text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the untested assumption that LLMs can produce realistic human-like text, providing robust evaluation tools beyond unreliable human judgments.

Method: The authors propose a validation framework combining aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) and interpretable linguistic features. They compare nine LLMs across five calibration strategies using content from X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit.

Result: Results show LLM outputs are distinguishable from human text, especially in emotional tone. Instruction-tuned models perform worse than base models, and increasing model size does not improve realism. A trade-off exists between human-likeness and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that while the introduced framework is effective for validation, LLMs face limitations in fully capturing human communication, calling for caution and refinement in their use for simulating human behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates if large language models can pass Poland's National Appeal Chamber examination, finding they perform well in theory but fail in practical adjudication and exhibit key limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capabilities of large language models in effectively performing as exam candidates or judges in Polish public procurement law assessments.

Method: Reviewed performance of multiple LLMs on a two-part exam consisting of a knowledge test and practical judgment, employing closed-book and Retrieval-Augmented Generation setups.

Result: Models showed satisfactory performance on the theoretical knowledge test but failed the practical written component and had inconsistencies when acting as automated evaluators.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations such as logical inconsistencies and susceptibility to errors, making them unable to replace human judges or exam committees in specialized legal settings.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REMIND evaluates how well a machine learning model forgets specific training data to ensure privacy and regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of indirect information leakage when machine learning models fail to fully forget unlearned training data.

Method: The proposed method, REMIND, analyzes loss dynamics over small input variations to detect residual memorization in language models.

Result: REMIND identifies subtle remaining influences of unlearned data, achieving higher sensitivity and robustness compared to existing evaluation methods.

Conclusion: REMIND provides a practical framework for reliable, interpretable evaluation of machine unlearning across diverse models and real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

*Alex Fang,Thomas Voice,Ruoming Pang,Ludwig Schmidt,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Today's pre-training methods for large language models leave substantial information unutilized in their datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how efficiently large language models extract knowledge from pre-training datasets.

Method: Using retrieval augmented generation and test-time compute to evaluate unused dataset value left after pre-training.

Result: Retrieval from datasets enhances accuracy in tasks (e.g., MMLU, Math-500) and acts as a compute multiplier; shows a 10 percentage point improvement on MMLU with added test-time compute.

Conclusion: Pre-training methods can be significantly improved to better utilize existing datasets for enhanced model performance.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

*Salma Mekaoui,Hiba Sofyan,Imane Amaaz,Imane Benchrif,Arsalane Zarghili,Ilham Chaker,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based method for topic labeling, focusing on efficient and interpretable models without heavy computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of unstructured text data, there is a need for efficient methods to extract and label topics that lack interpretability in traditional topic modeling approaches.

Method: A graph-based approach enriches topic words by adding semantically related terms and analyzes their relationships within the graph to derive meaningful labels.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional benchmarks on BERTScore and cosine similarity while being comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, with significantly lower computational demands.

Conclusion: Graph-based topic labeling offers a promising, computationally efficient way to enhance interpretability in topic modeling, with future research needed to further improve automation and accuracy.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSPO, a sentence-level importance ratio reinforcement learning algorithm that prevents training collapse, high variance, and improper data discarding, yielding improved performance over GRPO and GSPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms like GRPO and GSPO suffer issues such as unstable policy updates and under-utilization of sampling data, necessitating improved optimization mechanisms.

Method: SSPO uses sentence-level importance ratio, balancing the benefits of GRPO and GSPO, and employs sentence entropy with PPO-CLIP to adjust clipping bounds dynamically for better exploration and stabilization.

Result: SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively addresses the limitations of prior algorithms like GRPO and GSPO while improving reasoning skill optimization in large language models, showcasing superior data leverage and performance.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an effective data selection methodology for fine-tuning machine translation systems, achieving better data efficiency and translation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving machine translation system performance by utilizing high-quality and relevant training data.

Method: The paper proposes a data-selection method leveraging a learnability score to evaluate data utility, combined with a batch selection strategy optimizing data interdependencies.

Result: Experiments using an mBART model showed up to fivefold data efficiency improvement, enhanced computational efficiency, and superior translation performance compared to random selection.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology significantly improves machine translation efficiency and generalization, highlighting the advantages of targeted data selection for training.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs' temporal reasoning by answering trivia as if in 1940, concluding larger models perform better and prompts in English yield unexpectedly superior results compared to Norwegian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how LLMs perform temporal reasoning and language-specific capabilities when answering historical trivia questions.

Method: Trivia questions from a 1940 Norwegian book, posed in English and Norwegian, were answered by LLMs, judged by the LLMs themselves with validations by a native speaker.

Result: Prompts in English were found to consistently outperform Norwegian prompts, and larger LLMs achieved better performance.

Conclusion: The results highlight both model improvements with larger architectures and unexpected language-specific discrepancies in LLM performance.

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for predicting depression severity lack robust uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling, essential for clinical decision-making.

Method: The PTTSD framework combines bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections, and probabilistic output heads (Gaussian or Student-t). It is trained via negative log-likelihood and includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one modeling variants.

Result: PTTSD demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in text-based depression detection (MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) while providing well-calibrated prediction intervals. Ablation studies and comparisons with MentalBERT validated its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PTTSD is a reliable and interpretable tool for clinical depression severity assessment, offering significant advancements in uncertainty-aware and temporal modeling in this domain.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

TL;DR: ThaiOCRBench introduces a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-centric tasks, highlighting proprietary models' advantages and gaps in open-source systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating vision-language models on low-resource languages like Thai, especially tasks requiring document structure understanding.

Method: ThaiOCRBench offers a human-annotated dataset with 2,808 samples across 13 categories and evaluates various VLMs in a zero-shot setting, performing error analysis.

Result: Proprietary models significantly outperform open-source systems, with steep performance drops in fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench helps in understanding challenges like language bias and structural mismatches, aiding future improvements in Thai-language document understanding.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

Motivation: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mainly focus on small and simple tables, which do not adequately demonstrate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with real-world complex tabular data.

Method: RUST-BENCH includes 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables across two domains: NSF grant records and NBA statistics, providing challenges in scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity.

Result: Experiments revealed that LLMs struggle with handling real-world heterogeneous data and multi-hop reasoning, underscoring persistent limitations in their current architectures.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH sets a rigorous standard for tabular reasoning, encouraging further research to address LLMs' weaknesses in processing complex, real-world tabular data.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

*Cuong Huynh,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the OUNLP system for readability-controlled text simplification, using GPT-4o and multi-round simplification methods influenced by CEFR level gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the relationship between the source and target CEFR levels in text simplification and leverage this finding for better performance.

Method: They devised multi-round simplification methods (MRS-Rule and MRS-Joint) for text simplification using LLM-prompting and GPT-4o.

Result: The submitted systems ranked 7th among 20 teams in the TSAR-2025 Shared Task, and further improvements with MRS-Joint enhanced performance.

Conclusion: Using LLM simplified candidates as a foundation improves multi-round text simplification, demonstrating the potential of utilizing CEFR level gap analysis.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

*Christos-Nikolaos Zacharopoulos,Revekka Kyriakoglou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates personality-like traits in six Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) and identifies differences, especially in Neuroticism and Extraversion, influenced by sampling temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore personality-like behaviors in LLMs for responsible AI development and deployment, given their increasing role in human-centered applications.

Method: The researchers applied the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) personality assessment framework to six LLMs under varied sampling temperatures and conducted hierarchical clustering analysis.

Result: The study found significant differences in personality traits across four of the five dimensions, with Neuroticism and Extraversion being notably affected by temperature changes. Hierarchical clustering identified distinct trait clusters among models.

Conclusion: Personality-like behaviors emerge in LLMs, influenced by sampling temperatures and architectural features, offering new directions for model tuning, selection, and ethical AI governance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

*Joshua Gao,Quoc Huy Pham,Subin Varghese,Silwal Saurav,Vedhus Hoskere*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents RAGalyst, a framework for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems specifically in specialized safety-critical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in evaluating RAG systems in specialized domains where existing metrics either lack domain-specific nuance or fail to align with human judgment.

Method: RAGalyst creates synthetic QA datasets from source documents using an agentic pipeline with filtering for data fidelity. It optimizes LLM-as-a-Judge metrics through prompt engineering to correlate with human annotations and evaluate RAG across three domains.

Result: The evaluation demonstrated that performance is context-dependent, with no universally optimal embedding model, LLM, or configuration. Common reasons for low Answer Correctness are analyzed.

Conclusion: RAGalyst is a systematic evaluation framework providing deep insights into domain-specific trade-offs, empowering practitioners to design effective RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.

### [75] [Modeling Clinical Uncertainty in Radiology Reports: from Explicit Uncertainty Markers to Implicit Reasoning Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04506)
*Paloma Rabaey,Jong Hak Moon,Jung-Oh Lee,Min Gwan Kim,Hangyul Yoon,Thomas Demeester,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods to address explicit and implicit uncertainty in radiology reports, employing a machine learning-based approach to improve their automated analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports are vital for clinical decisions but often contain uncertainty, which hinders automated analysis and demands a structured approach to handling this uncertainty.

Method: The two-part framework includes an expert-validated, LLM-based ranking system for explicit uncertainty and a diagnostic expansion framework for modeling implicit uncertainty by systematically adding sub-findings.

Result: The study released an enhanced resource called Lunguage++, featuring an uncertainty-aware version of structured radiology reports, beneficial for image classification and diagnostic reasoning.

Conclusion: The enriched Lunguage++ dataset facilitates higher quality automated analysis, enabling uncertainty-aware diagnostics and exploration of its clinical impacts.

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

*Amir Zur,Atticus Geiger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Eric Bigelow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how language models represent reasoning paths and control uncertainty during text generation, focusing on chain-of-thought reasoning and using activation interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether language models represent alternate reasoning paths, and to address the difficulty of quantifying uncertainty during text generation.

Method: Hidden activations are used to analyze, control, and predict language model uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: There is a correlation between a model's token uncertainty and the effectiveness of activation intervention, showing models implicitly represent possible reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Language models represent alternate paths during reasoning, and activation interventions can effectively steer uncertainties and predict future outcomes.

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

TL;DR: IntelliProof is a system designed to analyze argumentative essays using LLMs, offering an argumentation graph for better visualization and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding, scoring, and visualization of argumentative essays by focusing on qualitative analysis and user experience.

Method: Utilizes LLMs to generate argumentation graphs which classify and score relationships in essays. Provides visualizations and justifications for these analyses.

Result: The system allows enhanced exploration of argumentative quality with human oversight, offering tools for deeper essay analysis.

Conclusion: IntelliProof bridges the gap between structural and semantic understanding of essays, emphasizing user experience and analysis quality.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system
are available here to try: \textbf{https://intelliproof.vercel.app}

*Cyril Vallez,Alexander Sternfeld,Andrei Kucharavy,Ljiljana Dolamic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) used for code generation, introduces metrics (Prompt Exposure and Model Exposure) to assess and mitigate the risks associated with LLM-generated vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the cybersecurity implications of LLMs in coding, given their increasing importance and the persistence of vulnerabilities despite existing benchmarks and approaches.

Method: Development of novel metrics: Prompt Exposure (PE) and Model Exposure (ME), focusing on vulnerability severity, generation likelihood, and prompt formulation.

Result: Demonstrated vulnerabilities in latest models and introduced actionable metrics (PE and ME), revealing the safety-functionality trade-off in current LLMs.

Conclusion: Without improved measures, LLM-generated vulnerabilities remain a risk; proposed metrics aim to guide more effective model improvements for cybersecurity.

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies, including Traditional,
Zero-Shot Fallback, Agentic, Iterative Feedback, and Aggregate RAG, combining

*Alamgir Munir Qazi,John P. McCrae,Jamal Abdul Nasir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeReC, a fact verification framework that uses dense retrieval and classification to outperform traditional LLM-based approaches in efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Language Model (LLM)-driven fact verification systems are computationally intensive and prone to inaccuracies like hallucinations, necessitating a more efficient and reliable solution for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose DeReC, a lightweight framework that utilizes general-purpose dense text embeddings for retrieval and combines it with specialized classification methods, avoiding the need for autoregressive LLMs.

Result: DeReC is significantly more efficient, reducing runtime by 95% on RAWFC and 92% on LIAR-RAW datasets. Its F1 score on RAWFC surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, achieving 65.58% compared to L-Defense's 61.20%.

Conclusion: DeReC demonstrates that dense retrieval-based systems can match or exceed the performance of LLMs in fact-checking tasks with significantly lower computational costs, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized
tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEASH, a training-free decoding algorithm to optimize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by adaptively stopping the generation process, reducing computational costs by minimizing token usage and latency, with minor accuracy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency in the computational process of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, as generating fixed-length rationales inflates both token use and latency, making the approach computationally wasteful.

Method: The paper proposes LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, which uses the slope of token-level entropy and top-logit margin improvements to adaptively halt rationale generation when stable reasoning is detected. This method requires no additional training and is model-agnostic.

Result: When tested on instruction-tuned models using GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduced token generation by 30-35% and latency by 27%, while only dropping accuracy by 10 percentage points compared to standard CoT prompting.

Conclusion: LEASH is a computationally efficient and simple method for optimizing CoT prompting, reducing overhead significantly while maintaining reasonable accuracy, making it suitable for scenarios where computational efficiency is a priority.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a key technique for enabling complex
reasoning in large language models. However, generating full, fixed-length
rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency.
We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free
decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors
two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in
the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau,
indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four
instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces
average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10
p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no
additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative
to CoT decoding.

### [82] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, enables low-cost on-device adaptation of CNNs using tensor-train assistance for tasks like Human Activity Recognition (HAR), achieving high accuracy while updating only a small fraction of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for practical on-device fine-tuning of CNNs under tight resource constraints arises from domain shifts in edge applications such as HAR. Existing fine-tuning methods are inefficient for resource-limited edge platforms.

Method: LoRA-Edge builds on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD). It selectively updates only the output-side core of pre-trained convolutional layers, reduces trainable parameters significantly, and keeps inference cost unchanged.

Result: LoRA-Edge maintains accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters. It outperforms previous methods on diverse HAR datasets and CNNs, with 1.4-3.8x faster convergence on a Jetson Orin Nano device.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge offers a practical, efficient, and high-performing solution for edge platforms to adapt CNNs to domain shifts while adhering to memory, compute, and energy constraints.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SILVI, an open-source software for annotating animal behavior and interactions in video data, enhancing computer vision capabilities in behavioral analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal behavior analysis often lacks tools that can annotate and detect interactions while localizing individuals, a necessary step for deeper ecological and behavioral studies.

Method: The authors developed SILVI, incorporating features for behavior and interaction annotation directly within video data, supporting structured outputs for computer vision model training.

Result: SILVI facilitates annotation of interactions in animal videos, increases potential for automated analysis, and links behavioral ecology and computer vision methodologies.

Conclusion: SILVI bridges gaps in behavior annotation tools and offers a new utility for both ecological and broader use-cases, including human interaction annotation.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of noise injection techniques to improve the generalization of deep learning models for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays across various data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models fail to generalize well to out-of-distribution data, particularly for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays. This failure arises because the models rely on dataset-specific artifacts rather than robust biomarkers, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

Method: The study applies noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt-and-Pepper noise) during training to make deep learning models more robust to distribution shifts.

Result: The application of noise injection techniques reduces the performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, and specificity.

Conclusion: Noise injection during training enhances the robustness of deep learning models to distribution shifts, improving their generalization for real-world applications in COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays. The source code is made publicly available for replication and further research.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how humans recognize social interactions and tests whether 3D visuospatial pose information aids this task, outperforming AI vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans effortlessly understand social interactions visually, but the underlying computations are poorly understood, and AI struggles with this task.

Method: State-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms were utilized to extract 3D joint positions from video clips, which were then compared to AI models in predicting social interaction judgments.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed current AI vision models, showing that critical social information is found in explicit 3D pose features rather than learned features of standard AI models.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding depends on structured 3D pose representations, and this knowledge can enhance AI models for better social interaction recognition.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates imitation learning for X-ray-guided spine procedures, showcasing its potential through a simulated environment and identifying both successes and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether imitation learning-based robot control policies could be applied to complex X-ray-guided spine procedures, despite challenges in interpreting multi-view X-rays.

Method: Developed a realistic simulated environment for X-ray-guided spine procedures, curated trajectory datasets, and trained imitation learning policies for visual alignment and open-loop control.

Result: Policy achieved safe cannula trajectories with 68.5% first-attempt success across diverse anatomy and initializations, indicating generalizability. Additionally, rollouts on real X-rays showed plausible trajectories despite exclusive simulation training.

Conclusion: Imitation learning shows promise for lightweight spinal navigation, but challenges like entry point precision and frequent feedback need addressing for full closed-loop control.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced YOLO-based object detection framework for real-time waste detection in remote desert environments, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the global waste crisis and the inefficiency of traditional waste collection methods in remote or challenging terrains, particularly deserts.

Method: The paper introduces a pruned lightweight version of YOLOv12, integrated with Self-Adversarial Training and specialized data augmentation, demonstrating results using the DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: The enhanced framework achieves significant improvements in precision, recall, and mAP, with low latency and compact model size, optimized for aerial drones.

Conclusion: The study validates that combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements effectively enables robust waste detection in underexplored environments like deserts.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [88] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Class-Based Image Composition (CoImg), a method to enhance intra-class variance by creating composite input images from multiple images of the same class. Applied to a retinal OCT dataset with significant class imbalance, it improves accuracy and prediction quality in deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often falter on small, imbalanced datasets and low-quality input images, leading to high rates of false predictions. This paper seeks to address this issue by enhancing the quality of training inputs.

Method: The authors propose reformulating training inputs by fusing multiple images from the same class into composite images (CoImg). These composite images increase intra-class variance and information density per sample. They evaluate this approach on a class-balanced, modified version of the OCTDL dataset, named Co-OCTDL, using a VGG16 model.

Result: The method significantly improved diagnostic metrics: achieving 99.6% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.995, and an AUC of 0.9996. It also reduced the false prediction rate compared to models trained on the original dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Class-Based Image Composition method successfully enhances prediction quality in deep learning models, even in cases of small and class-imbalanced datasets. It demonstrates the potential to tackle challenges in medical imaging and similar domains.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

### [89] [I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912)
*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised, oracle-free anomaly detection system for medical imaging, expanding the set of normal images incrementally without requiring manual anomaly labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in medical imaging is difficult due to the lack of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert supervision. There is a need for efficient and unsupervised methods that can adapt and reliably classify normal data without annotations.

Method: A frozen pretrained vision backbone is enhanced with convolutional adapters for quick domain adaptation. It uses k-NN anomaly scoring with embeddings stored in a coreset. Admission into the trusted set is controlled by a dual probabilistic gating system based on distance thresholds and epistemic uncertainty.

Result: The framework achieves significant improvements in anomaly detection metrics, including ROC-AUC and PR-AUC, across datasets such as COVID-CXR, Pneumonia CXR, and Brain MRI ND-5.

Conclusion: This framework successfully refines normality definitions incrementally, reliably, and efficiently in real-world medical imaging scenarios with minimal label dependencies, demonstrating its potential for label-scarce applications.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [90] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for precise temporal action localization and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for efficient computation. It achieves up to 4.2% mAP improvement across various benchmarks while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the inefficiencies of uniform computation in temporal action localization, particularly in handling varying complexities of boundary detection.

Method: Two key methods are proposed: Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) enhances boundary detection precision by using signed-distance regression. Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) optimizes computation cost using a continuous depth selection strategy for dynamic processing.

Result: BDR retrofits existing methods with minimal code changes, improving mAP performance by 1.8 to 3.1%. ATR achieves a 2.9% mAP gain on THUMOS14 while reducing computation by 18%, with remarkable improvement in short action localization.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve performance, efficiency, and generalizability in temporal action localization while reducing computational resources needed to train and run models, confirmed by experiments across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing geometry and appearance of 3D reconstructions using Gaussian-mesh joint optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve 3D reconstruction methods by merging geometric accuracy and photorealistic rendering for more integrated and editing-friendly results.

Method: Utilizing Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering to optimize mesh geometry and vertex colors by photometric consistency and geometric regularization.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D reconstructions that can be utilized in downstream editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation.

Conclusion: Unified geometry and appearance optimization enhances 3D reconstruction quality and usability for various applications, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving accurate calibration of internal parameters is essential yet challenging for reliable 3D reconstruction using light field cameras.

Method: The authors introduce a linear fractional transformation (LFT) parameter, α, which decouples the main lens and micro lens array. They propose an analytical least squares solution with nonlinear refinement and a new method for detecting features from raw images.

prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw

### [93] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a synthetic dataset for predicting structural elements like walls and floors in 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods often miss occluded surfaces, particularly structural elements such as walls, floors, and ceilings.

Method: Introduced the 'Room Envelopes' dataset containing RGB images and pointmaps for visible surfaces and structural layouts, enabling supervised monocular geometry prediction.

Result: Accurate predictions for both visible surfaces and underlying structural layouts using feed-forward monocular estimators.

Conclusion: The dataset and approach provide better understanding of a scene's extent and object layouts, aiding in complete and cost-efficient 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CaRF, a framework designed to improve the task of Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation by operating directly in 3D Gaussian space, addressing cross-view consistency issues of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation face challenges in achieving cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view-specific feature learning.

Method: The paper proposes the Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), which incorporates Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to model view-dependent variations and enhances geometric reasoning. It also introduces In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) for aligning Gaussian logits across calibrated views.

Result: The method demonstrates notable improvements in mIoU over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving average increases of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% on Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes more reliable 3D scene understanding with multi-view consistency, opening opportunities for advancements in embodied AI, AR/VR interactions, and autonomous perception systems.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr is a framework for improving physical consistency in text-to-video generation, addressing common issues of implausible object dynamics and unrealistic motion. It integrates a physics-based reward model and optimization techniques for better physical realism in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation systems often produce videos with unrealistic object dynamics, interactions, and motions, undermining their usability in simulation-heavy applications like robotics and embodied AI.

Method: The paper introduces PhysCorr, which includes PhysicsRM, a reward model assessing physical consistency, and PhyDPO, a preference optimization pipeline that uses contrastive feedback and physics-aware weighting. The approach is model-agnostic and integrates with existing architectures.

Result: PhysCorr demonstrates notable improvements in both physical realism and visual quality across various video benchmarks, preserving semantic alignment of generated outputs.

Conclusion: PhysCorr addresses critical limitations in text-to-video generation by focusing on physical plausibility. This advancement contributes to more reliable and useful video generation systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

Motivation: The challenge of adapting pretrained Vision Transformers for unseen domain generalization efficiently without compromising generalization capability.

Method: The proposed method, GNN-MoE, employs a Mixture-of-Experts framework combined with efficient Kronecker adapters. It uses Graph Neural Networks for dynamic patch assignment based on inter-patch relationships.

Result: GNN-MoE achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization benchmarks while requiring fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing in GNN-MoE proves effective for robust and lightweight domain generalization in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is negatively impacted by the reliance on pre-trained models using natural images, leading to a significant domain gap.

Method: MedDChest was pre-trained from scratch using a curated dataset of chest imaging modalities (X-ray, CT) and employed Guided Random Resized Crops, a novel data augmentation method focusing on anatomically relevant areas.

Result: MedDChest significantly outperformed ImageNet-pretrained models in various thoracic diagnostic tasks, proving the efficacy of in-domain pre-training and targeted data augmentation.

Conclusion: MedDChest offers a robust and specialized feature extractor for thoracic imaging tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy and supporting future medical imaging research through publicly available model weights.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring is a sparse voxelized representation that supports high resolution (2048+) for 3D meshes without requiring mesh-to-field conversion or surface extraction processes. It achieves near-lossless fidelity and excels in accuracy and efficiency for representation and reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D mesh representations often compromise geometric fidelity or require complex processes like water-tightening and iso-surface extraction, which are inefficient and restrict resolution and flexibility.

Method: The paper introduces Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation preserving geometric sharpness and internal structures. It incorporates a dual-mode autoencoder for scalable, detail-preserving 3D mesh reconstruction.

Result: Faithful Contouring outperformed existing methods, achieving significantly lower errors in direct representation and mesh reconstruction metrics, including a 10^-5 level distance error, 93% reduction in Chamfer Distance, and 35% improvement in F-Score.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring provides a high-fidelity, efficient representation of arbitrary 3D meshes, demonstrating suitability for 3D learning tasks while offering flexibility for texturing and editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a robust biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals obtained from low-frame-rate fingertip videos, achieving 98% authentication accuracy using a hybrid deep learning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in biometric authentication using PPG, such as motion artifacts, variability, and ensure efficient, scalable, and robust solutions for wearable and mobile device applications.

Method: A lightweight framework using PPG signals with preprocessing (PCA motion artifact suppression, filtering, normalization) and a hybrid deep learning model (CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM combining spatial and temporal features) is developed and evaluated on the CFIHSR dataset.

Result: The proposed approach achieved a high authentication accuracy of 98% on PPG data from 46 subjects, demonstrating its robustness to noise and inter-subject variations.

Conclusion: The framework's efficiency, robustness, and inherent liveness detection make it a strong candidate for real-world biometric security systems in mobile and wearable devices.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

*Zehui Feng,Chenqi Zhang,Mingru Wang,Minuo Wei,Shiwei Cheng,Cuntai Guan,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bratrix, a framework for aligning brain and visual data with linguistic semantics, improving multimodal understanding and surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of aligning neural signals with visual semantics, considering subject variability and the limitations of visual-only representations in capturing latent semantic dimensions.

Method: Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into visual and linguistic components, aligns brain representations with language embeddings, and incorporates an uncertainty perception module for improved reliability. It uses a two-stage training strategy for optimization.

Result: Bratrix enhances retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance across EEG, MEG, and fMRI datasets, achieving significant improvement in tasks like EEG retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed Bratrix framework effectively utilizes language-anchored alignment, overcoming challenges in neural signal analysis and enabling advancements in multimodal understanding with improved precision.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates two approaches for CT image denoising: CycleGAN-based residual translator and Noise2Score (N2S), achieving significant improvements in denoising metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore effective and training-data-efficient methods for unpaired and self-supervised CT image denoising.

Method: The study identifies optimal configurations for a CycleGAN approach using a U-Net backbone, and compares its performance to a Noise2Score method under a consistent evaluation protocol.

Result: CycleGAN improves noisy input metrics (PSNR/SSIM) remarkably; Noise2Score shows robust performance with very noisy inputs despite lacking clean pairs.

Conclusion: CycleGAN delivers superior image quality, while Noise2Score offers competitive, pair-free denoising capability, emphasizing utility across different scenarios.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKAST is introduced as a medical image segmentation model integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks into Swin Transformers, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer-based models with improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in medical image segmentation caused by complex anatomical structures and limited annotated training data. Existing CNN and Transformer-based models struggle with balancing local feature extraction, modeling long-range dependencies, and data efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes UKAST, integrating rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Swin Transformer encoders. Rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) improve efficiency, reduce the computational load, and provide better accuracy over conventional models.

Result: UKAST achieves state-of-the-art results across four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, surpassing CNN and Transformer baselines. It performs exceptionally well in data-scarce settings while maintaining reduced computational load.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of KAN-enhanced Transformers, as seen in UKAST, for advancing data-efficient and accurate medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialLock, a framework for precise control of object localization in text-to-image synthesis using perception signals and grounding information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of precise object localization in text-to-image synthesis, as existing methods fail to adequately utilize positional information.

Method: The method involves two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) for spatial information integration via attention layers and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) for perception-based supervision to refine object localization.

Result: SpatialLock achieves state-of-the-art results in object positioning, with IOU scores exceeding 0.9 across various datasets.

Conclusion: SpatialLock improves spatial arrangements in text-to-image synthesis, enhancing precise object localization and the visual quality of generated images.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free strategy for diffusion sampling that enhances speed while preserving high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency in diffusion sampling, where conventional solvers fail to exploit redundancies in the noise estimation and additional guidance processes.

Method: THG uses a multirate system to separate the noise estimate and guidance term, integrating them on fine-grained and coarse grids respectively. It also employs an adaptive timestep sampler and a guidance-scale scheduler for optimization.

Result: THG reduces function evaluations by up to 30% without compromising image generation fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under the same computational budget.

Conclusion: Multirate formulations show significant potential for improving diffusion solvers, leading to efficient and high-quality image synthesis without retraining. The source code is publicly available for validation and further exploration.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

Conclusion: The proposed BoRe-Depth model effectively enhances depth estimation and boundary quality in embedded systems, providing a lightweight solution for 3D perception in unmanned systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception
in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched
because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges
of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model,
BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate
depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality.
Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which
adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation.
Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the
object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is
deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We
demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous
lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed
ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free diffusion model framework for sketch generation with precise style control using textual prompts and reference sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods prioritize generic synthesis but lack mechanisms for precise style control over generated sketches.

Method: The framework uses diffusion models with linear smoothing and style-content guidance mechanisms to incorporate reference features as auxiliary information, reducing content leakage. It also supports multi-style generation via a joint AdaIN module.

Result: The approach achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and increased flexibility in style control, even when structural similarity is low between the reference and target sketches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables improved synthesis quality and precise style control in sketch generation, outperforming prior methods in terms of flexibility and alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

*Shengyu Tang,Zeyuan Lu,Jiazhi Dong,Changdong Yu,Xiaoyu Wang,Yaohui Lyu,Weihao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DMSORT, a dual-branch system for maritime multi-object tracking with efficient performance and robustness against visual degradation caused by camera movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe vessel navigation and maritime surveillance require robust multi-object tracking (MOT), which is hindered by camera motions and visual degradation in complex maritime environments.

Method: The DMSORT framework uses a parallel tracker with affine compensation combining object detection, re-identification (ReID), and dynamic camera motion estimation. It integrates a Reversible Columnar Detection Network for robust detection, a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor for contextual features, and a motion-appearance fusion module.

Result: DMSORT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Singapore Maritime Dataset with high identity consistency and robustness. It is the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks.

Conclusion: DMSORT offers an innovative solution for maritime MOT challenges by addressing camera motion, noise, occlusion, and drift effectively. The method enhances tracking robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework enabling computer agents to learn from online tutorial videos to improve their task execution, outperforming other methods using textual tutorials or transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between computer-use agents and human users in performing domain-specific tasks by utilizing online video tutorials for actionable guidance.

Method: Develop a framework that extracts actionable steps from videos using visual language models (VLM), segments these into demonstrations, and dynamically selects the most relevant guidance during inference.

Result: The proposed framework showed superior performance on benchmarks compared to base agents and textual-only methods, with improved inference aided by video-derived trajectories.

Conclusion: Tutorial videos can systematically enhance computer agents' task efficiency when appropriately processed into structured, actionable guidance during inference, showcasing potential for enriched automation systems.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark named OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB) and a robust rotation classification pipeline for scanning/photographing documents, with significant improvements in OCR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rotation correction is crucial for improving OCR performance, as misaligned documents due to user errors lead to reduced OCR accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce ORB benchmark datasets (ORB-En for English and ORB-Indic for Indic languages) and a rotation classification pipeline using Phi-3.5-Vision model with dynamic cropping, fine-tuned for a 4-class rotation task.

Result: The proposed classifier achieves 96% accuracy on ORB-En and 92% on ORB-Indic, significantly boosting OCR performance in both closed-source and open-weight models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances OCR robustness to rotations, improving downstream OCR accuracy for both English and Indic languages.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how color transformation techniques affect image registration in digital pathology, focusing on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images and multimodal images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the alignment and integration of multimodal images in digital pathology for enhanced biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction.

Method: Using a dataset of 20 tissue sample pairs, the study employs preprocessing steps like color transformations (CycleGAN, Macenko, etc.), contrast adjustment, normalization, and denoising. Image registration is performed using the VALIS method with rigid and non-rigid registration steps across different resolutions.

Result: CycleGAN color transformation yielded the lowest registration errors, outperforming other methods based on rTRE and custom point-based evaluations.

Conclusion: Color transformations, particularly CycleGAN, enhance the image registration accuracy for multimodal images in digital pathology, supporting improved analysis and reliability.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Motivation: Covariance descriptors have shown success in general vision tasks but are underexplored in medical imaging. The study aims to leverage them for enhanced medical image classification.

Method: Covariance descriptors constructed from pretrained general vision encoder features (DINOv2 and MedSAM) are compared with handcrafted descriptors using SPDNet across eleven MedMNIST datasets.

Result: The results demonstrate that covariance descriptors derived from GVE features consistently outperform handcrafted descriptors. SPDNet achieves superior performance when combined with DINOv2 features.

Conclusion: Combining covariance descriptors with pretrained vision encoders has significant potential for advancing medical image analysis.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

TL;DR: This paper proposes improving human motion style transfer by incorporating skewness and kurtosis, in addition to mean and variance, with a novel Adaptive Statistics Fusor method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance realism and reduce rigidity in human motion style transfers by addressing limitations of traditional methods relying solely on mean and variance.

Method: Developed Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF), combining Style Disentanglement Module and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention, accompanied by a Motion Consistency Regularization discriminator.

Result: AStF achieves superior proficiency in motion style transfer compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating higher-order statistics in the analysis significantly improves the spatiotemporal understanding and dynamic style representation for human motion style transfer.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: To revisit and assess human-centric foundation models for medical imaging, moving beyond traditional domain-specific approaches.

Method: Adapting and pretraining 'Sapiens,' a human-centric model, on multi-dataset medical imaging to create 'MedSapiens' tailored for anatomical landmark detection.

Result: MedSapiens outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 21.81% (specialist models) and 5.26% (generalist models) in success detection rate and demonstrates adaptability in limited-data settings.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models optimized for spatial pose localization hold untapped potential for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, offering robust results and adaptability.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

### [115] [Proto-LeakNet: Towards Signal-Leak Aware Attribution in Synthetic Human Face Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04260)
*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet, a framework for identifying synthetic images and deepfakes, uses signal leaks in latent representations for robust source attribution and authenticity verification, achieving impressive accuracy (98.13% Macro AUC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increased sophistication in synthetic image and deepfake generation presents significant challenges to ensuring source attribution and image authenticity, necessitating effective forensic tools.

Method: Proto-LeakNet utilizes latent space signal leaks from diffusion models and reconstructs partial forward diffusion to identify generator-specific cues. It employs a temporal attention encoder and feature-weighted prototype structures for both closed-set classification and open-set evaluation.

Result: Proto-LeakNet achieves a Macro AUC of 98.13%, showing robustness against post-processing and clear distinctions between known and unseen generators.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that latent space signal leakage can be effectively modeled for robust and interpretable forensic analysis of AI-generated images and deepfakes.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

*Yujie Yang,Shuang Li,Jun Ye,Neng Dong,Fan Li,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework to improve cross-modal video-based person re-identification by leveraging gait features alongside visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VVI-ReID underutilize gait features, which are modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics, critical for spatiotemporal modeling.

Method: The authors introduce the DinoGRL framework with a SASGL model for semantic-aware gait representation learning and a PBMGE module for progressive bidirectional feature refinement across spatial granularities.

Result: DinoGRL achieves significant improvements in VVI-ReID performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating modality-invariant gait features with appearance cues using DINOv2-based visual priors enhances performance in cross-modal video matching.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastGS is an acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting, improving speed while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in 3D Gaussian splatting methods by better managing the number of Gaussians for reduced computational overhead.

Method: It uses a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, eliminating the need for a budgeting mechanism.

Result: FastGS speeds up training significantly (up to 15.45×) across various tasks and datasets while retaining comparable rendering quality.

Conclusion: FastGS is effective and generalizable for accelerating 3DGS training, balancing speed and quality, applicable to multiple reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

### [118] [Vision Foundation Models in Agriculture: Toward Domain-Specific Adaptation for Weed Herbicide Trials Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04288)
*Leire Benito-Del-Valle,Artzai Picón,Daniel Mugica,Manuel Ramos,Eva Portillo,Javier Romero,Carlos Javier Jimenez,Ramón Navarra-Mestre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a domain-specific vision foundation model tailored for herbicide trials, outperforming general-purpose models in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Herbicide trials require precise identification of plant species and damage classification in diverse agricultural environments, which general-purpose models struggle with.

Method: The authors adapt a vision foundation model using self-supervised learning on a curated agricultural dataset to optimize its representations for herbicide trial images.

Result: The domain-specific model achieves improved results in species and damage classification, especially under challenging and unseen conditions, while significantly reducing annotation effort.

Conclusion: Domain-specific foundation models enhance generalization, reduce manual annotation needs, and offer effective solutions for automating herbicide trial analysis.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

*Robin Spanier,Thorsten Hoeser,Claudia Kuenzer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explored the use of synthetic training data to improve the YOLOv10 model's ability to detect marine infrastructures using synthetic and real satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of underrepresented samples in datasets for offshore infrastructure detection and improve monitoring efficiency.

Method: Deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models were trained using synthetic and real satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and tested for geographic transferability across various global regions.

Result: The synthetic data improved model performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.85, which rose to 0.90 with synthetic data incorporation. Detection results showed successful transfers across unseen regions.

Conclusion: Balanced datasets, enriched with synthetic data, enhance global detection capabilities and demonstrate the potential of deep learning in improving scalable and effective offshore infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

*Xiangjun Zhang,Litong Gong,Yinglin Zheng,Yansong Liu,Wentao Jiang,Mingyi Xu,Biao Wang,Tiezheng Ge,Ming Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE-T2V introduces a framework integrating prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction to enhance T2V diffusion models in generating high-quality videos from concise prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models struggle with maintaining video quality using concise prompts due to limited textual semantics understanding and inability to adjust prompts online to match user intentions.

Method: RISE-T2V employs a Rephrasing Adapter to enable video generation models to utilize language model hidden states for prompt rephrasing, enhancing semantic alignment and usability.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves the ability of text-to-video models to produce high-quality videos aligning with user intent.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V is a universal enhancement applicable to multiple video diffusion model architectures, demonstrating significant advancements in T2V tasks through better prompt handling and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

*Saúl Alonso-Monsalve,Leigh H. Whitehead,Adam Aurisano,Lorena Escudero Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for automated segmentation of tumors in 3D radiological images using voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks, achieving high accuracy and efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor segmentation in radiological images is time-consuming and hampers routine clinical analysis. Automated segmentation methods are needed for practical clinical applications.

Method: The method combines two stages: voxel sparsification for reducing data and submanifold sparse convolutional networks for processing native 3D high-resolution inputs. This approach decreases computational demands while maintaining performance.

Result: The method achieved competitive results in the KiTS23 challenge: Dice coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7% for tumors + cysts, and 80.3% for tumors alone. It also reduced inference time by up to 60% and VRAM by up to 75%.

Conclusion: Using this methodology provides state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy with significant computational savings, highlighting its practical potential for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines the effects of sensor occlusion on 3D object detection using BEV-based fusion architecture, pointing out its reliance on LiDAR and the significant drop in detection accuracy under occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate how environmental conditions causing sensor occlusions impact the accuracy of 3D object detection in automated vehicles.

Method: Researchers leverage a BEVFusion architecture and analyze its performance using the nuScenes dataset under varying degrees of occlusion on both camera and LiDAR sensors. Metrics include mAP and NDS.

Result: Camera occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP, while LiDAR performance declines by 47.3% under heavy occlusion. Fusion settings show minor impact when the camera is occluded (4.1% drop) but significant dependence on LiDAR (26.8% drop).

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of developing occlusion-aware evaluation methods and robust sensor fusion techniques to ensure reliable 3D detection performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

Result: The tutorial includes MATLAB code demonstrations, helping users process imaging data from multiple modalities commonly used in analytical chemistry.

Conclusion: This work is practical in nature and encourages readers to implement the tutorial steps on their own datasets, potentially increasing the adoption of deep learning approaches in analytical chemistry.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial

*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HideAndSeg, a minimally supervised AI tool for octopus video segmentation, overcoming challenges posed by their camouflage and dynamic behaviors in underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their camouflage, dynamic body changes, occlusions, and underwater lighting variability. A lack of annotated datasets exacerbates these complexities.

Method: The paper presents HideAndSeg, which combines SAM2 for initial segmentation and a custom-trained YOLOv11 detector for automated video analysis. It utilizes user-provided initial inputs for training and introduces unsupervised evaluation metrics for refinement.

Result: HideAndSeg shows improved segmentation quality compared to manually promoted methods, successfully re-identifying octopuses even after occlusion. It achieves reduced noise and satisfactory performance in natural scenarios.

Conclusion: HideAndSeg opens opportunities for efficient behavioral studies of wild octopuses by minimizing manual effort and addressing segmentation challenges, paving the way for advances in cephalopod research in complex environments.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

### [128] [Solving Convex Partition Visual Jigsaw Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04450)
*Yaniv Ohayon,Ofir Itzhak Shahar,Ohad Ben-Shahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores solving complex 'Convex Partitions' puzzles using a new computational method and provides benchmarks for its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the scope of automatic puzzle solving beyond square jigsaw puzzles to include polygonal puzzles with convex pieces.

Method: The authors combine geometrical and pictorial compatibility and introduce a greedy solver for solving convex partition puzzles.

Result: The paper reports performance metrics and introduces the first benchmark dataset for convex partition puzzles.

Conclusion: This work broadens the applicability of computational puzzle solvers and establishes a foundation for future research on polygonal puzzles.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces V-Thinker, a multimodal reasoning assistant enhancing LMMs' ability for vision-centric and interactive reasoning using reinforcement learning and new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations in image-interactive thinking and reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs).

Method: Developed V-Thinker using a Data Evolution Flywheel for creating datasets and Visual Progressive Training Curriculum for perception alignment and reinforcement learning integration.

Result: V-Thinker outperformed strong LMM-based baselines in general and interactive reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: V-Thinker advances the 'Thinking with Images' paradigm and provides valuable insights into improving interactive reasoning in multimodal models while introducing VTBench as a benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

*Wenwen Li,Sizhe Wang,Hyunho Lee,Chenyan Lu,Sujit Roy,Rahul Ramachandran,Chia-Yu Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for adapting geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs) to overcome challenges in landslide mapping. The authors highlight their model, Prithvi-EO-2.0, showing advantages over existing methods while addressing computational and data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning models struggle with sensor variability, regional differences, and limited training data for landslide mapping. There is a need for robust and adaptable solutions.

Method: The authors propose a three-axis analytical framework (sensor, label, domain) and adapt Prithvi-EO-2.0 with global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning. Experiments compare it to other models.

Result: Prithvi-EO-2.0 consistently outperformed task-specific CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE) in resilience to spectral variation, label scarcity, and generalization.

Conclusion: This study showcases GeoFMs as a promising direction for improving landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring, but emphasizes challenges like computational cost and limited AI-ready training data.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

*Nabyl Quignon,Baptiste Chopin,Yaohui Wang,Antitza Dantcheva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel evaluation framework for talking head video generation, introducing 8 metrics divided into quality, naturalness, and synchronization dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for evaluating talking head video generation are limited and do not fully align with human preferences or account for nuanced video characteristics like expression expressiveness.

Method: The authors propose 8 efficient metrics focused on head, mouth, eyebrow dynamics, and face quality to evaluate video generation. They curated a novel dataset to reduce data bias and conducted large-scale experiments on 85,000 videos from 17 state-of-the-art algorithms.

Result: Results reveal that existing algorithms are proficient in lip synchronization but struggle with expressiveness and producing artifact-free details.

Conclusion: The benchmark and dataset presented will drive improvements in generative methods, with open access to code, dataset, and leaderboards to monitor progress.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STC-Net, a novel framework for estimating surgical complexity in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy videos through the Parkland Grading Scale, operating directly on full videos under weak temporal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of assessing surgical complexity in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy videos is critical due to its association with operative time and postoperative risks, yet remains unexplored through fully automated methods.

Method: STC-Net was developed to analyze full surgical videos using a single-timestamp-based approach for grading complexity via localization, window proposal, and grading modules, integrated with a novel loss formulation.

Result: STC-Net achieved significant accuracy (62.11%) and F1-score (61.42%), surpassing baseline methods with over 10% improvement on a dataset of 1,859 LC videos.

Conclusion: STC-Net is a scalable, automated method for surgical complexity estimation that holds promise for post-operative analysis and enhancing surgical training.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft
localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:
Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable
and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation
from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and
surgical training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Thinking with Video" paradigm using video generation models like Sora-2, aiming for unified multimodal reasoning, and evaluates its performance on text and vision-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paradigms involving "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" are limited as static images fail to capture dynamic processes, and text and vision remain distinct modalities, hindering unified reasoning.

Method: The study employs "Thinking with Video" paradigm via a video generation model (Sora-2) within a unified temporal framework and benchmarks it using VideoThinkBench, covering vision-centric and text-centric tasks.

Result: Sora-2 excels in several benchmarks, comparable to or better than state-of-the-art VLMs in visual tasks and achieving high accuracy on text-centric tasks (e.g., 92% accuracy on MATH).

Conclusion: The findings position video generation models as promising unified multimodal reasoning systems, bridging visual and textual understanding.

Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

*Chen Shi,Shaoshuai Shi,Xiaoyang Lyu,Chunyang Liu,Kehua Sheng,Bo Zhang,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSplat is a feed-forward framework for 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, combining spatio-temporal fusion, a 3D latent scaffold, and a dual-branch decoder for better visual results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D scene reconstruction in autonomous driving face difficulties with sparse views and dynamic environments.

Method: UniSplat builds a latent 3D scaffold leveraging foundation models, employs an efficient spatio-temporal fusion technique, and utilizes a dual-branch decoder for dynamic-aware scene completion.

Result: UniSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and produces robust, quality renderings beyond camera coverage.

Conclusion: UniSplat is a powerful tool for overcoming challenges in dynamic reconstruction, offering enhanced scene completion and visualization in real-world datasets.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

### [135] [PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601)
*Yicheng Xiao,Yu Chen,Haoxuan Ma,Jiale Hong,Caorui Li,Lingxiang Wu,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP enhances fine-grained image-text alignment for the CLIP model, using visual prompts and an improved textual encoding approach through a novel dataset and framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CLIP's limitations in processing granular textual descriptions and improve its fine-grained alignment capabilities for better vision-language understanding.

Method: PixCLIP employs a modified text encoder from LLMs coupled with a three-branch pixel-text alignment framework and a dataset called LongGRIT that features detailed image-text annotations.

Result: Experiments validate PixCLIP's advancements in pixel-level interactions with images and handling detailed textual inputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained alignment.

Conclusion: PixCLIP successfully enhances CLIP's ability to process localized image information and long-form textual descriptions, pushing boundaries of image-text alignment research.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Tushar Kataria,Shikha Dubey,Mary Bronner,Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz,Ben J. Brintz,Shireen Y. Elhabian,Beatrice S. Knudsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework to evaluate the quality and accuracy of virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining models by analyzing image translations. Results reveal limitations in common image fidelity metrics and emphasize performance differences among paired and unpaired models, using pixel-level assessments and whole-slide image benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of evaluating the reliability and accuracy of virtual IHC stain generation models in pathology, as existing metrics primarily focus on fidelity rather than accuracy.

Method: The framework employs color deconvolution to generate pixel masks of IHC-positive regions. Metrics like Dice, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Hausdorff distance are used to quantify the pixel-level accuracy of predictions without requiring manual annotations. Sixteen different models, both paired and unpaired, are evaluated for their performance.

Result: Paired models like PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE performed best in stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models were less reliable. Image fidelity metrics such as FID, PSNR, and SSIM showed weak correlation with stain accuracy or pathologist assessments. Whole-Slide Image (WSI) evaluations reveal performance discrepancies not captured by patch-based reviews.

Conclusion: This framework provides a reproducible and automated method to assess the quality and accuracy of virtual IHC models. It highlights the need for WSI-based benchmarks and offers insights for improving the computational tools for pathology applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable, temporal-aware model for video quality assessment (VQA) that doesn't rely on references or human opinion labels, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing full-reference and no-reference VQA methods, which require clean reference videos or expensive human opinion labels, and to incorporate temporal context vital for video tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a model trained on synthetic degradations of the DAVIS dataset using a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to predict full-reference metrics, such as LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM, without references during inference.

Result: The proposed model outperformed an image-based baseline, generalizing across diverse degradations and achieved higher correlation with full-reference metrics compared to widely-used opinion-aware models like BRISQUE.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling enhances scalable VQA approaches, and the proposed opinion-unaware, no-reference method demonstrates effectiveness in real-world applications compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Polarization-Enabled Eye Tracking (PET) system that leverages polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging for improved eye tracking performance compared to intensity-only imaging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing eye tracking systems often face limitations in accuracy due to factors like eyelid occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil size variations. By introducing polarization imaging, the paper aims to enhance the detection of gaze patterns and tracking features for more robust performance.

Method: The authors use a polarization-filter-array camera paired with a linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator to acquire polarization-resolved images of ocular tissues. Machine learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks, are trained on this polarization data for gaze tracking.

Result: The PET system reduced the median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10–16% compared to intensity-only imaging baselines in tests with 346 participants, showing robustness even under challenging conditions like eyelid occlusions and other variations.

Conclusion: Polarization-resolved imaging links optical properties of tissues to improvements in gaze tracking accuracy. This positions PET as a promising modality for wearable human-computer interaction devices.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes diagnostic methods to detect and mitigate biases in multimodal benchmarks by uncovering and removing non-visual biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks break down because models exploit biases and non-visual inputs, compromising true visual understanding.

Method: The authors develop diagnostic tools, including a Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) and Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP), to identify and filter biased samples.

Result: Applying these methods reveals systemic biases in four multimodal benchmarks, and debiased versions show improved alignment with visual-focused evaluations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to diagnose and debias multimodal benchmarks, offering tools to strengthen reliability and visual-centric evaluation.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

*Ellis Brown,Arijit Ray,Ranjay Krishna,Ross Girshick,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIMS-V, a 3D simulator-based framework for creating spatially-rich video training data to improve multimodal language models' spatial reasoning capabilities, achieving strong results with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving multimodal language models' spatial reasoning abilities, especially given the difficulty of obtaining diverse real-world annotated video data.

Method: The researchers developed SIMS-V, a data-generation framework using 3D simulators to create spatially rich video datasets. They performed systematic ablations to identify the most effective question categories for spatial intelligence training.

Result: The study found that a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) resulted in better real-world transfer. A 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on only 25K simulated examples outperformed a larger 72B baseline and achieved competitive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates efficient training, robust generalization, and significant improvements in spatial reasoning for multimodal models while maintaining video understanding abilities, showcasing the effectiveness of simulator-generated data in overcoming data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper advocates for improving multimodal intelligence via spatial supersensing, introducing a benchmark and predictive sensing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack true multimodal intelligence as they rely on brute-force context expansion and limited cognition paradigms.

Method: The authors propose spatial supersensing, a 4-stage intelligence paradigm, along with VSI-SUPER benchmarks and predictive sensing techniques for improved modeling.

Result: Using VSI-590K for training and predictive sensing techniques, the authors achieve substantial gains on their benchmarks but note scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing.

Conclusion: Models require predictive capabilities to anticipate, organize, and segment spatial experiences for achieving advanced multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

### [142] [InfinityStar: Unified Spacetime AutoRegressive Modeling for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04675)
*Jinlai Liu,Jian Han,Bin Yan,Hui Wu,Fengda Zhu,Xing Wang,Yi Jiang,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityStar is a unified autoregressive framework for high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis, delivering superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance high-resolution image and video synthesis through a unified, efficient autoregressive model that integrates spatial and temporal dependencies.

Method: InfinityStar uses a purely discrete autoregressive approach within a single architecture and employs temporal autoregression for unified spatial and temporal task capabilities.

Result: InfinityStar achieves a score of 83.74 on VBench, outperforms existing autoregressive models and competitors like diffusion-based HunyuanVideo, and generates 720p videos 10x faster.

Conclusion: InfinityStar sets a new high standard in discrete autoregressive video generation and releases resources for further research in efficient video synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely
discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a
single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of
generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long
interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench,
outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some
diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model
generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading
diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete
autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p
videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient,
high-quality video generation.

### [143] [Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04678)
*Yihong Sun,Xinyu Yang,Jennifer J. Sun,Bharath Hariharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'Track Any State' task and TubeletGraph system for tracking objects undergoing transformations, also offering a benchmark dataset (VOST-TAS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tracking methods struggle to maintain object identification after transformations due to significant changes in appearance.

Method: The TubeletGraph system uses semantic and proximity priors to integrate overlooked tracks, reasons about these tracks, and builds a state graph describing object transformations over time.

Result: TubeletGraph outperforms existing tracking methods in transformation scenarios and showcases its potential in temporal grounding, semantic reasoning, and understanding complex transformations.

Conclusion: TubeletGraph addresses limitations in object transformation tracking, contributing a benchmark dataset and a method for deeper understanding of object state changes.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

*Rafe Loya,Andrew Hamara,Benjamin Estell,Benjamin Kilpatrick,Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of singular image crops in automatic cropping techniques by proposing methods to produce multiple distinct aesthetically appealing crops, motivated by social media applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic image cropping methods often focus on creating a single crop, which is insufficient for modern applications like social media where multiple distinct aesthetically appealing crops are desirable.

Method: The authors introduce a dataset of 277 images with human annotations and evaluate single-crop models combined with an image partitioning algorithm as a pre-processing step.

Result: The study shows that combining single-crop models with an image partitioning technique can enhance the production of distinct and quality crops.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into improving image cropping techniques to generate multiple distinct crops suitable for modern applications, supported by a newly introduced dataset.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as
a pre-processing step. The dataset is available at

### [145] [OMPILOT: Harnessing Transformer Models for Auto Parallelization to Shared Memory Computing Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03866)
*Arijit Bhattacharjee,Ali TehraniJamsaz,Le Chen,Niranjan Hasabnis,Mihai Capota,Nesreen Ahmed,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces OMPILOT, a transformer for translating C++ to OpenMP for shared-memory parallelization, optimized with novel pre-training objectives and evaluated using OMPBLEU, a new metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models initially designed for natural language processing now excel at code translation, challenges remain in translating C++ to OpenMP for effective parallel programming.

Method: The paper proposes OMPILOT, an encoder-decoder transformer using custom pre-training focused on parallel constructs, combining supervised and unsupervised learning, and operating at the function level. The evaluation uses the proposed OMPBLEU metric.

Result: Results demonstrate that OMPILOT strengthens code translation accuracy and robustness for C++-to-OpenMP transformations compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: OMPILOT showcases the potential of domain-specific models in improving code translation for parallel programming and addresses limitations of traditional metrics with OMPBLEU.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient
transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for
natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling
programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based
systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined
cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy
code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific
encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,
enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom
pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs
and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve
code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on
loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a
wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel
composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of
OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation
metrics.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Markov Chain-based stochastic model to optimize power management in edge computing, highlighting AI-driven predictive scaling for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing faces power management challenges due to distributed devices with limited energy resources, necessitating optimized solutions.

Method: The paper uses Markov Chains for analyzing power state transitions and employs AI-driven predictive power scaling, validated by Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analysis.

Result: Results show predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary transitions, optimizes workload distribution, reduces energy disparities, and enhances responsiveness across heterogeneous edge nodes.

Conclusion: AI-driven power management strategies enhance energy efficiency and optimize adaptive workload coordination in edge computing environments.

Abstract: Edge Computing enables low-latency processing for real-time applications but
introduces challenges in power management due to the distributed nature of edge
devices and their limited energy resources. This paper proposes a stochastic
modeling approach using Markov Chains to analyze power state transitions in
Edge Computing. By deriving steady-state probabilities and evaluating energy
consumption, we demonstrate the benefits of AI-driven predictive power scaling
over conventional reactive methods. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model,
showing strong alignment between theoretical and empirical results. Sensitivity
analysis highlights how varying transition probabilities affect power
efficiency, confirming that predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary
transitions and improves overall system responsiveness. Our findings suggest
that AI-based power management strategies significantly enhance energy
efficiency by anticipating workload demands and optimizing state transitions.
Experimental results indicate that AI-based power management optimizes workload
distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes, reducing energy consumption
disparities between devices, improving overall efficiency, and enhancing
adaptive power coordination in multi-node environments.

### [147] [Parallel Spawning Strategies for Dynamic-Aware MPI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04268)
*Iker Martín-Álvarez,José I. Aliaga,Maribel Castillo,Sergio Iserte*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel parallel spawning strategy for dynamic resource management in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, targeting the challenges of malleability in MPI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic resource management in HPC systems enables improved workload management, reduced job waiting times, and better system utilization. However, malleability in resource allocation incurs high reconfiguration costs that demand optimization.

Method: The authors introduce a parallel spawning strategy where all processes cooperate in the spawning and distribution of resources. The new method also removes shrinkage limitations, improving system adaptability and reducing execution overhead.

Result: The proposed strategy achieves competitive expansion times (up to 1.25x overhead) and significantly reduces shrinkage costs by at least 20x. It is validated on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.

Conclusion: This strategy effectively addresses malleability limitations in HPC systems, enhances resource allocation processes, and contributes to reduced makespan and increased system efficiency in various environments.

Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High
Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource
allocation at runtime. This capability has been shown to reduce workload
makespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system
utilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of
applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although
beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the
reduction of these costs an important research topic.
  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,
which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.
Other MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when
shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across
nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.
This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning
strategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,
thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage
limitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and
reducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times
with at most a $1.25\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations
that reduce their cost by at least $20\times$. This strategy has been validated
on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in
shared-resource environments.

### [148] [Enabling Dynamic Sparsity in Quantized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04477)
*Rongxiang Wang,Kangyuan Shu,Felix Xiaozhu Lin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents techniques to deploy large language models efficiently on resource-constrained devices using dynamic sparse inference and low-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models on end-user devices is challenging due to limitations in memory and compute capabilities of mobile and desktop GPUs. Dynamic sparsity in LLMs offers computational efficiency but faces challenges with quantization.

Method: The proposed method introduces a zigzag-patterned quantization layout, a specialized GEMV kernel for efficient computing, and a runtime mechanism to handle sparse indices with minimal overhead.

Result: The approach achieved up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput compared to dense quantized inference while maintaining accuracy on commodity GPUs.

Conclusion: Structured sparsity and quantization techniques can effectively coexist, enabling efficient LLM deployment on constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining
importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost.
Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make
efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal
activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,
only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity
could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,
which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained
hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of
techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.
The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes
weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory
locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully
utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that
gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and
hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding
throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,
showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on
commodity GPUs.

*Silvia Bonomi,Giovanni Farina,Roy Friedman,Eviatar B. Procaccia,Sebastien Tixeuil*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure model for self-protecting distributed systems, improving resilience against evolving attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern distributed systems face increasing security risks from attackers, necessitating enhanced design strategies to ensure fault tolerance.

Method: The authors incorporate the MAPE-K architecture into a self-protecting distributed system and propose a probabilistic model to simulate Byzantine failure dynamics.

Result: Mathematical analysis and simulations showcase the model's ability to predict system recovery and the impact of Byzantine infection rates.

Conclusion: The proposed model advances understanding of distributed system resilience and aids in designing adaptive, self-protecting strategies.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers
continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire
system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design
phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a
theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be
abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system.
Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it
introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in
reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting
distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a
shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic
Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component.
Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to
drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze
mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes
crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe
state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the
rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the
behavior of the system under such assumptions.

*Petr Kuznetsov,Nathan Josia Schrodt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces dynamic concurrency to address synchronization challenges in distributed computing and presents a universal construction based on this concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronization often limits scalability in distributed computing. Conflicts arise when concurrent operations depend on execution order, yet these conflicts are rare under specific system states.

Method: The authors define and utilize dynamic concurrency, where strong synchronization occurs only when necessary, based on the current system state.

Result: The paper proposes a universal construction built on dynamic concurrency, enabling conflict resolution with optimized synchronization.

Conclusion: Dynamic concurrency minimizes unnecessary synchronization and enhances scalability in distributed computing through adaptive conflict resolution.

Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed
computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization
when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order
in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a
\emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it
is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely
occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic
concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it
\emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system
state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.

### [151] [One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809)
*François Belias,Naser Ezzati-Jivan,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new adaptive batch scheduler (DEBA) that improves training speed and accuracy by monitoring gradient variance, gradient norm variation, and loss variation, but its benefits differ across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive batch size methods assume a generic approach for all neural network architectures, but discrepancies in their effectiveness across architectures highlight the need for a tailored strategy.

Method: The DEBA scheduler adapts batch sizes dynamically based on gradient stability metrics and loss variations. Evaluation was done on six architectures using CIFAR datasets, including systematic experiments and ablation studies.

Result: Medium-depth and lightweight architectures saw significant speedup (45–62%) and accuracy gains (1–7%), while deeper architectures exhibited inconsistent outcomes. Gradient stability metrics predict benefits of adaptive scheduling per architecture.

Conclusion: DEBA shows that architecture-aware adaptive batch scheduling improves efficiency and accuracy. It also challenges the idea of one-size-fits-all adaptive methods, emphasizing critical design choices for batch adaptation success.

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving and efficient ECG classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments using federated learning.

Method: 1D ECG signals were transformed into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images for feature extraction via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The federated learning model was experimentally validated across heterogeneous IoT devices.

Result: The federated learning framework achieved 95.18% accuracy in ECG classification and improved training efficiency, despite additional computational complexity of GAF transformations. It was deployed on diverse devices, including servers and Raspberry Pi 4s.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of lightweight and privacy-preserving AI solutions in IoT-based healthcare, emphasizing scalability, security, and performance for edge-cloud integrations in smart health systems.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

TL;DR: LOLGORITHM is a modular multi-agent system for generating diverse and platform-compliant comments on short-video platforms, integrating video analysis and style-selection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short-video platforms drive user engagement and cultural dissemination, but creating context-aware, stylistically diverse, and guideline-compliant comments remains challenging.

Method: LOLGORITHM uses a modular multi-agent system with video segmentation, contextual analysis, affective analysis, and style-aware prompt construction integrated with a multimodal large language model.

Result: LOLGORITHM outperformed baseline models with preference rates above 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube, highlighting its effectiveness in generating stylized comments for varied content genres.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a scalable and adaptable system to enhance user engagement and creative interaction on short-video platforms, particularly through stylized comment generation.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

*Berk Iskar,Michael Taynnan Barros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a biologically-inspired learning framework for network anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy and robustness via a hybrid model combining astrocyte dynamics simulation with deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network anomaly detectors struggle with concept drift and new threats like zero-day or polymorphic attacks. The paper aims to overcome these limitations using biologically plausible mechanisms inspired by astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling.

Method: A novel framework couples astrocyte dynamics simulation (modeling Ca$^{2+}$ processes) with a deep neural network. The simulation incorporates mechanisms such as IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump uptake, and gap junction diffusion.

Result: The proposed Ca$^{2+}$-gated model excelled on CTU-13 network traffic data, achieving $  98% accuracy with fewer false positives and negatives compared to a baseline DNN, and with negligible runtime overhead after precomputing Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories.

Conclusion: The Ca$^{2+}$-modulated framework demonstrated effectiveness in cybersecurity applications and holds potential as a generic method for streaming detection tasks that require fast adaptation to changing data patterns.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

### [156] [What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768)
*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Common-O, a benchmark aimed at evaluating multimodal language models' reasoning capabilities by examining their performance on in-the-wild scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the models' hallucinations and the performance gap between benchmarks and real-world reasoning, exposing challenges in reasoning across scenes.

Method: A new benchmark named Common-O is created, with 10.5k examples of previously unused images to assess reasoning across scenes by querying 'what's in common?' It evaluates leading multimodal models' ability to reason rather than just perceive.

Result: The best-performing multimodal models achieve only 35% on Common-O, and on a more complex subset (Common-O Complex), only 1%. It indicates reasoning across scenes is still a difficult problem.

Conclusion: Models show improvement with scaled multi-image training, but significant work is needed to reduce hallucinations and enhance reasoning capabilities. The benchmark, Common-O, has been made publicly available to encourage research in this area.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

*Xiaoling Luo,Peng Chen,Chengliang Liu,Xiaopeng Jin,Jie Wen,Yumeng Liu,Junsong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DSRPGO, a method focusing on multimodal protein function prediction through dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein function predictions require integrating and understanding diverse multimodal features like structure, sequence, and interactions, which poses complexity challenges.

Method: Introduction of reconstructive pre-training to capture fine-grained low-level features. Development of the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) and Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) for efficient multimodal feature learning and hierarchical multi-label classification.

Result: DSRPGO outperforms benchmark models in predicting protein functions across categories like BPO, MFO, and CCO using human datasets.

Conclusion: The DSRPGO model demonstrates that dynamic selection and multimodal interactive learning improve protein function prediction performance significantly.

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

*Jaden Park,Mu Cai,Feng Yao,Jingbo Shang,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract focuses on detecting test-set contamination in open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and proposes a robust detection method using multi-modal semantic perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is concern among practitioners and users regarding inflated performance in Vision-Language Models due to test-set leakage from internet-scale pretraining data.

Method: The authors deliberately contaminate open-source Vision-Language Models and introduce a novel detection method employing multi-modal semantic perturbation.

Result: Existing detection approaches either fail or exhibit inconsistencies, whereas the proposed method proves effective in identifying contaminated models under various strategies.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for robust detection methods for contaminated VLMs and provides an effective solution, validated across contamination methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

### [159] [FusionDP: Foundation Model-Assisted Differentially Private Learning for Partially Sensitive Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03806)
*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FusionDP is a framework for enhancing model utility under feature-level differential privacy using foundation models and a modified DP-SGD algorithm, reducing excessive noise and preserving sensitive feature privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address utility degradation caused by traditional DP-SGD that unnecessarily enforces privacy on all features in a sample, especially when only a subset of features requires privacy.

Method: The paper introduces a two-step framework: (1) Using large foundation models to impute sensitive features from non-sensitive ones, and (2) Adopting a modified DP-SGD algorithm to train on both original and imputed features while ensuring feature-level privacy.

Result: FusionDP is evaluated on sepsis prediction (PhysioNet) and clinical note classification (MIMIC-III) tasks and exhibits significant improvement in model performance compared to privacy-preserving baselines while maintaining strict feature-level privacy.

Conclusion: FusionDP demonstrates that foundation model-driven imputation and modified DP-SGD can enhance the privacy-utility trade-off for different modalities, offering a scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

### [160] [Fair and Explainable Credit-Scoring under Concept Drift: Adaptive Explanation Frameworks for Evolving Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03807)
*Shivogo John*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops adaptive explanation frameworks to address concept drift in credit-scoring systems, improving fairness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional explainability techniques fail to adapt to concept drift inherent in the dynamic credit-scoring landscape, leading to unstable and potentially unfair explanations.

Method: Adaptive SHAP explanation techniques including per-slice reweighting, drift-aware rebaselining, and online surrogate calibration were used alongside XGBoost predictive modeling.

Result: Adaptive methods showed improved stability, reduced demographic disparities, and maintained predictive accuracy under real-world drift conditions.

Conclusion: Adaptive explainability is a practical tool for ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in evolving decision systems like credit scoring.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a routing method to reduce computational costs of reasoning language models by assigning problems to the smallest suitable model without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying reasoning language models is costly due to their large size and complex reasoning processes, prompting a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: The approach uses a pool of reasoning models and trains lightweight predictors based on intermediate representations to guide routing decisions for problem difficulty or model correctness.

Result: Routing on math benchmarks achieves computational efficiency while matching the performance of the largest model (s1.1-32B).

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing effectively reduces deployment cost without sacrificing performance, making reasoning models more accessible and practical.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

*Ryien Hosseini,Filippo Simini,Venkatram Vishwanath,Rebecca Willett,Henry Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Sketched Random Features' to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by addressing oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressive power, improving long-range dependency capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs face challenges in processing long-range information, maintaining node representation distinctiveness, and expressive capability due to the limitations of the local message-passing paradigm.

Method: Inject randomized global embeddings called 'Sketched Random Features' into GNNs, which are unique, distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic, enhancing information processing.

Result: Experimental results show consistent performance improvements across real-world graph learning tasks compared to baseline GNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively addresses key GNN limitations while being complementary to other existing techniques, establishing its reliability and utility in graph-focused applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff)', enabling smoother transitions from offline to online reinforcement learning by mixing offline and online strategies based on the distributional structure of the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of distributional shifts that occur when transitioning from offline reinforcement learning to online learning due to differences between offline behavioral policies and online evolving policies.

Method: StratDiff employs a diffusion model to learn from the offline dataset, refines it with energy-based functions, computes KL divergence to assess sample distribution, stratifies training batches, and applies tailored offline and online learning strategies.

Result: StratDiff demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods when integrated with methods like Cal-QL and IQL, as proven through evaluations on D4RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: StratDiff helps achieve smoother offline-to-online RL transitions with greater adaptability and stable performance across varied RL settings.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

*James Enouen,Yujia Zheng,Ignavier Ng,Yan Liu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach for causal structure learning using hypergraphs to represent higher-order interactions. The authors extend the causal additive model and develop a novel algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of focus on higher-order interactions in causal structure learning, which are essential for understanding real-world processes.

Method: The authors extend the causal additive model to accommodate higher-order interactions using directed acyclic hypergraphs. They propose theoretical tools, identifiability results, and an adapted greedy algorithm for structure learning.

Result: The proposed hypergraph-based approach and extended greedy algorithm show improved empirical performance in synthetic experiments, demonstrating its feasibility and advantages for inferring complex causal relationships.

Conclusion: Incorporating hypergraphs into causal structure learning enables better representation of higher-order interactions, improves empirical results, and provides a new avenue for advancing the field.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADQ enhances Deep Q-Networks by integrating successor-state distributions and modeling environment dynamics, leading to stable and policy-aligned value updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current DQN approaches struggle with high variance and instability due to next states generated by potentially suboptimal policies, which misalign with the agent's current policy.

Method: SADQ explicitly incorporates successor-state distributions and models stochastic transition dynamics for better Q-value estimation and more efficient action selection.

Result: SADQ shows superior performance over traditional DQNs in terms of stability and learning efficiency, verified through extensive testing on RL benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: SADQ reduces variance and improves value updates in DQNs, establishing itself as a more robust and efficient alternative.

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

*Wuxia Chen,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for quickest change detection in high-dimensional Markov processes by estimating conditional scores using sample pairs, avoiding explicit likelihood evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of detecting changes in Markov processes with unknown transition kernels, particularly in high-dimensional settings where traditional methods struggle.

Method: The method involves learning the conditional score between sample pairs and using a score-based CUSUM procedure, incorporating truncated statistics for bounded increments and leveraging Hoeffding's inequality for Markov processes.

Result: The proposed method is supported by theoretical guarantees, including exponential lower bounds on false alarm time and asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay, confirming its feasibility and reliability.

Conclusion: The paper provides an efficient, practical approach for change detection in high-dimensional Markov models with robust theoretical validation.

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers introduce Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF), a novel time-series problem analyzing early interactions on platforms (e.g. accesses, downloads, likes) to predict long-term correlated outcomes (e.g. sales, citations, reviews). They present benchmark datasets and methodologies for exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a unified approach within the time-series community for studying lead-lag relationships, despite its prevalence across various domains like research citations, social media, and e-commerce.

Method: The researchers curated and cleaned high-volume datasets (arXiv and GitHub) verified lead-lag dynamics statistically and evaluated baseline forecasting methods. They provided additional examples of similar lead-lag dynamics in other domains.

Result: Two new benchmark datasets were created (arXiv and GitHub), demonstrating long-term lead-lag relationships. The researchers verified the patterns and provided baselines for regression predictions, establishing LLF as a distinct forecasting paradigm.

Conclusion: Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) is a novel methodology that enables insights into patterns between early interactions and temporally shifted outcomes, and offers a foundation for addressing forecasting challenges. This study provides the tools and data necessary for its systematic exploration.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) methods on generalization in deep learning, focusing on overparameterized networks with smooth activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how higher-order optimization methods affect the generalization abilities of deep neural networks.

Method: Investigates SGN with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling, providing finite-time convergence and generalization bounds, utilizing variable-metric analysis and uniform stability approaches.

Result: Findings show a favorable regime for SGN, where larger minimum eigenvalues of the Gauss-Newton matrix correlate with tighter stability bounds and improved generalization performance.

Conclusion: SGN methods can contribute positively to generalization under specific scenarios influenced by curvature, batch size, and overparameterization.

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces DecoHD, a framework in hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to achieve extreme memory savings and hardware efficiency without significantly sacrificing model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior HDC models that face reduced feature concentration and robustness upon footprint reduction, particularly when using fixed atomic hypervectors for compressing learned class prototypes.

Method: It proposes DecoHD, a novel decomposed HDC parameterization with a shared set of per-layer channels that employs multiplicative binding across layers, bundling at the end for expansive representational space, lightweight bundling heads for compression, and end-to-end training preserving HDC-native operations.

Result: DecoHD achieves high memory savings with minimal accuracy impact (average deviation of ~0.1-0.15% from baseline), robustness against bit-flip noise, a ~97% reduction in trainable parameters, and significant energy and speed improvements over CPUs, GPUs, and baseline HDC hardware.

Conclusion: DecoHD successfully enables lightweight and efficient hyperdimensional computing by preserving the advantages of HDC while integrating compression and hardware optimization, making it applicable for memory-constrained environments and energy-efficient hardware deployment.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

scalable method for generating synthetic pre-training data to enable
meta-learning of decision trees. Our approach samples near-optimal decision
trees synthetically, creating large-scale, realistic datasets. Using the
MetaTree transformer architecture, we demonstrate that this method achieves
performance comparable to pre-training on real-world data or with
computationally expensive optimal decision trees. This strategy significantly
reduces computational costs, enhances data generation flexibility, and paves
the way for scalable and efficient meta-learning of interpretable decision tree
models.

### [171] [On Predicting Sociodemographics from Mobility Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03924)
*Ekin Uğurel,Cynthia Chen,Brian H. Y. Lee,Filipe Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to infer sociodemographic attributes from mobility data using structured mobility descriptors, diagnostic tools, and multitask learning frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transportation planners face challenges predicting sociodemographic traits from mobility data due to weak relationships and limited generalization across contexts.

Method: Authors utilize higher-order mobility descriptors, introduce metrics for uncertainty validation, and employ multitask learning for robust sociodemographic prediction.

Result: The proposed methods enhance prediction accuracy, improve uncertainty metrics, and outperform single-task models in limited or shifted datasets.

Conclusion: Using structured mobility patterns and multitask learning improves predictive capability and generalization for sociodemographic inference from mobility data.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

### [172] [On Joint Regularization and Calibration in Deep Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04160)
*Laurits Fredsgaard,Mikkel N. Schmidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how jointly tuning deep ensembles can enhance performance and uncertainty calibration, introducing an overlapping holdout strategy to balance data use and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles improve machine learning performance and uncertainty calibration, but training them individually may not yield optimal results. This paper explores optimizing ensembles by joint tuning.

Method: Investigates joint tuning of hyperparameters like weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping. Proposes an overlapping holdout strategy for joint evaluation while maximizing training data.

Result: The study finds that joint tuning generally improves or matches predictive performance but notes variations across tasks. The overlapping holdout strategy proves effective for practical implementation.

Conclusion: Joint tuning of deep ensembles is beneficial, with the overlapping holdout strategy offering a balanced approach for optimization and data utilization. The findings can guide better ensemble training practices.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

### [173] [SynQuE: Estimating Synthetic Dataset Quality Without Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03928)
*Arthur Chen,Victor Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on optimizing the selection of synthetic datasets for better real-world task performance where real data is scarce, introducing the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE) framework and novel proxy metrics, including LENS, for effective evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data scarcity caused by collection costs or privacy concerns by enabling effective selection of synthetic datasets for real-world tasks.

Method: The authors introduce SynQuE, adapt distribution and diversity-based metrics using embedding models, and propose a novel proxy metric called LENS that utilizes large language model reasoning to predict the quality of synthetic datasets.

Result: The SynQuE framework and its proxies show good correlation with real-world task performance across diverse tasks. LENS significantly outperformed other methods, especially for complex tasks, improving task performance such as an 8.1% increase in text-to-SQL parsing accuracy when using top-3 selected synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: SynQuE is a valuable framework for synthetic dataset selection in scenarios with limited real data. It paves the way for further study on foundation model-based data characterization and refined data selection techniques.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastGAN introduces a decomposition-based adversarial framework for time series forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art models in short-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting models underperform in short-term predictions and often ignore categorical features.

Method: ForecastGAN integrates three modules: decomposition, optimal model selection, and adversarial training using Conditional GANs.

Result: ForecastGAN demonstrated superior performance on short-term forecasts across eleven multivariate datasets and competitive results in long-term predictions.

Conclusion: ForecastGAN offers a generalizable and robust approach to time series forecasting without extensive hyperparameter tuning, addressing key limitations in existing models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

*Obed Amo,Samit Ghosh,Markus Lange-Hegermann,Bogdan Raiţă,Michael Pokojovy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares a boundary-constrained Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a Crank-Nicolson Finite Element Method (CN-FEM) for solving the 2D wave equation and shows B-EPGP achieves significantly better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of solving partial differential equations, especially the 2D wave equation, using novel approaches like B-EPGP compared to traditional methods like CN-FEM.

Method: The study uses a Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) matching protocol to ensure fairness and compares the performance of B-EPGP against CN-FEM. B-EPGP leverages exponential-polynomial bases and penalized least squares for precise enforcement of PDE and boundary conditions.

Result: Under matched Degrees-of-Freedom, the B-EPGP method consistently outperforms the CN-FEM approach in terms of space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time $L^{2}$-error, achieving accuracy improvements of about two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: B-EPGP is a promising surrogate model for solving the 2D wave equation, offering superior accuracy compared to traditional CN-FEM methods under matched computational conditions.

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of
magnitude.

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) approach using logarithmic class-axis reduction to minimize memory usage while maintaining robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the memory, energy efficiency, and robustness of hyperdimensional computing in constrained systems and overcome the limitations of conventional approaches that compromise robustness when reducing dimensionality.

Method: Developed LogHD with logarithmic class-axis reduction, which substitutes multiple class prototypes with compact bundle hypervectors. Introduced capacity-aware codebook, profile-based decoding, and integration with feature-axis sparsification.

Result: LogHD achieves competitive accuracy, higher resilience to bit-flip rates, and significant enhancements in energy and computational efficiency compared to prior methods. It outperforms existing implementations on FPGA/ASIC platforms and standard hardware benchmarks.

Conclusion: LogHD reduces memory and energy consumption while preserving robustness and accuracy, making it a scalable and efficient alternative for resource-constrained systems, outperforming both traditional and feature-axis compressed HDC methods.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly
$2.5$-$3.0\times$ higher bit-flip rates than feature-axis compression; an ASIC
instantiation delivers $498\times$ energy efficiency and $62.6\times$ speedup
over an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X and $24.3\times$/$6.58\times$ over an NVIDIA RTX
4090, and is $4.06\times$ more energy-efficient and $2.19\times$ faster than a
feature-axis HDC ASIC baseline.

TL;DR: The paper defines forgetting in learners as a lack of self-consistency in predictive distribution, resulting in the loss of predictive information, and proposes a general measure to quantify it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a unified definition of forgetting in learning algorithms, which is crucial to understanding their adaptation process and mitigating the loss of knowledge.

Method: The authors propose a theory that characterizes forgetting as inconsistency in predictive distribution and test it through diverse experiments in classification, regression, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Forgetting occurs in diverse learning environments and significantly affects learning efficiency. The theory provides validated insights into understanding this phenomenon.

Conclusion: This work establishes a comprehensive understanding of forgetting and serves as a foundation to improve the information retention capabilities of learning algorithms.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hierarchical Importance-Guided Forgetting (HIF) as a novel approach to addressing the challenges of unlearning specific student data in cognitive diagnosis models while balancing efficiency, model utility, and unlearning completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for incorporating the 'right to be forgotten' in cognitive diagnosis models to comply with privacy demands, overcoming limitations of general unlearning algorithms.

Method: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Importance-Guided Forgetting (HIF), a novel algorithm that uses a smoothing mechanism combining individual and layer-wise importance to effectively unlearn data and optimize model performance.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HIF significantly surpasses existing unlearning methods in terms of key metrics such as efficiency, completeness, and model utility.

Conclusion: HIF is a pioneering algorithm for CD models, enabling efficient and precise user data removal while maintaining high performance and preserving AI system privacy.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 creates challenges for public health and vaccine development due to immune-evasive variants and noisy genomic data.

Method: PETRA leverages phylogenetic tree-derived evolutionary trajectories, using a weighted training framework to mitigate geographical and temporal data imbalance.

Result: PETRA significantly outperformed baseline methods in mutation prediction, achieving notable recall rates for nucleotide and spike amino-acid mutations.

Conclusion: PETRA advances the predictive modeling of viral evolution, offering tools for real-time analysis and aiding the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 mutation dynamics.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel composable fine-tuning method integrating graph structural priors with modular adapters to enhance efficiency and stability for multi-task adaptation in large pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pre-trained models face challenges such as high computational cost and structural instability while adapting to multiple tasks, necessitating a solution that ensures efficient task adaptation and structural robustness.

Method: The method employs graph structural priors using a relation matrix to encode task dependencies and modular adapters embedded via low-rank mapping. It facilitates efficient composition and reuse under prior guidance, addressing path conflicts and redundant computations.

Result: Experiments confirm improved task prediction accuracy, precise adapter weight allocation, enhanced computational efficiency, and consistency of the model under structural constraints.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of combining graph priors with modular mechanisms for composable fine-tuning, offering stability, parameter efficiency, and lightweight model design in multi-task environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

TL;DR: TwIST is a distributed training framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables efficient sparsification during training, offering competitive perplexity and inference speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to develop a method for large language model sparsification without requiring post-training procedures, as well as efficient inference improvements on hardware that lacks sparse computation support.

Method: TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in parallel, aggregates their parameters periodically, and resamples subnetworks to identify 'golden tickets' for sparsification.

Result: TwIST achieves competitive perplexity compared to state-of-the-art methods, significantly outperforming baselines under high sparsity conditions, and enables practical speedups on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: TwIST provides an efficient and effective training-time approach for sparse LLMs without requiring additional post-training fine-tuning or recovery processes.

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses how continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and wearable technologies can help identify unique metabolic subtypes of diabetes and prediabetes for tailored interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current methods of classifying diabetes and prediabetes, which overlook the heterogeneity of the underlying metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency.

Method: The paper highlights the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), machine learning, and wearable technology to analyze dynamic glucose data and metabolic patterns for more precise phenotyping.

Result: The findings show that CGM-enabled tests and machine learning can accurately predict measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell function. They also demonstrate how dietary responses and lifestyle patterns affect glucose levels differently for each person.

Conclusion: This research supports the shift towards a precision medicine approach in diabetes care, using CGM to identify and address individual metabolic subtypes for more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

### [186] [Memory- and Latency-Constrained Inference of Large Language Models via Adaptive Split Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04002)
*Mingyu Sung,Vikas Palakonda,Suhwan Im,Sunghwan Moon,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study focuses on addressing challenges in deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-limited IoT devices using a novel split computing framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome impractical deployment of LLMs on IoT devices due to massive parameter footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding.

Method: Proposed an autoregressive-aware split computing framework with techniques like one-point split compression (OPSC), a two-stage intermediate compression pipeline, and a unified optimization framework for optimal memory, latency, and communication efficiency.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance over existing quantization methods with a 1.49 inference speedup and reduced communication overhead while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: This framework makes LLM deployment feasible on edge devices by resolving key memory and latency constraints, with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

*Yuantian Shao,Yuanteng Chen,Peisong Wang,Jianlin Yu,Jing Lin,Yiwu Yao,Zhihui Wei,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DartQuant addresses quantization challenges by introducing a distribution-aware rotational calibration method, significantly improving efficiency and performance for large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate computational costs and overfitting issues in rotational optimization algorithms during model quantization.

Method: Proposes DartQuant, which uses distribution-aware rotational calibration and QR-Orth optimization scheme to enhance efficiency and mitigate overfitting risks during rotational optimization.

Result: Achieves 47x acceleration and 10x memory savings in rotational optimization on a 70B model, with successful calibration on a single 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: DartQuant makes large-scale model quantization feasible in resource-constrained environments through improved efficiency and reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates a deep learning model using ResNet to detect pediatric appendicitis in ultrasound images, achieving 93.44% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing pediatric appendicitis is challenging for clinicians due to overlapping symptoms and variable ultrasound imaging quality.

Method: A pretrained ResNet model was fine-tuned for image-based classification, distinguishing appendicitis from non-appendicitis cases using the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset.

Result: The model achieved 93.44% accuracy, 91.53% precision, and 89.8% recall in detecting appendicitis from heterogeneous ultrasound images, showing strong performance.

Conclusion: The proposed ResNet model successfully addresses challenges like low contrast and anatomical variability in pediatric ultrasound imaging, effectively diagnosing appendicitis.

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across
heterogeneous ultrasound views. The model effectively learned discriminative
spatial features, overcoming challenges posed by low contrast, speckle noise,
and anatomical variability in pediatric imaging.

*Fatemeh Hosseinabadi,Seyedhassan Sharifi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses the use of the nnU-Net framework for accurate and automated left atrium segmentation from cardiac MRI, achieving high performance in the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of the left atrium is challenging, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale clinical workflows; thus, there is a need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods.

Method: The authors applied the nnU-Net framework, a self-configuring deep learning model, to cardiac MRI data from the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset, adapting preprocessing, network architectures, and training pipelines for superior segmentation.

Result: The nnU-Net model achieved a mean Dice score of 93.5, surpassing traditional segmentation techniques and demonstrating high accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The nnU-Net model provides an effective, automated solution for left atrium segmentation in cardiac MRI, facilitating clinical workflows and outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnUNet model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the
atrial body and proximal pulmonary veins.

### [190] [Learning Filter-Aware Distance Metrics for Nearest Neighbor Search with Multiple Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04073)
*Ananya Sutradhar,Suryansh Gupta,Ravishankar Krishnaswamy,Haiyang Xu,Aseem Rastogi,Gopal Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search by learning dynamic trade-offs between vector distance and label filters, improving accuracy by 5-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing filtered ANN search methods often rely on fixed penalties for mismatches, which fail to generalize well across diverse datasets.

Method: A constrained linear optimization technique is used to learn weights guiding the trade-off between vector distance and filter satisfaction. These weights direct the search process and optimize the construction of graph structures.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates a significant 5-10% accuracy improvement over traditional fixed-penalty techniques.

Conclusion: Learning data-driven weights provides a more generalizable, effective, and flexible framework for filtered ANN search compared to fixed penalty methods.

Abstract: Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search retrieves the closest
vectors for a query vector from a dataset. It enforces that a specified set of
discrete labels $S$ for the query must be included in the labels of each
retrieved vector. Existing graph-based methods typically incorporate filter
awareness by assigning fixed penalties or prioritizing nodes based on filter
satisfaction. However, since these methods use fixed, data in- dependent
penalties, they often fail to generalize across datasets with diverse label and
vector distributions. In this work, we propose a principled alternative that
learns the optimal trade-off between vector distance and filter match directly
from the data, rather than relying on fixed penalties. We formulate this as a
constrained linear optimization problem, deriving weights that better reflect
the underlying filter distribution and more effectively address the filtered
ANN search problem. These learned weights guide both the search process and
index construction, leading to graph structures that more effectively capture
the underlying filter distribution and filter semantics. Our experiments
demonstrate that adapting the distance function to the data significantly im-
proves accuracy by 5-10% over fixed-penalty methods, providing a more flexible
and generalizable framework for the filtered ANN search problem.

### [191] [DeNoise: Learning Robust Graph Representations for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04086)
*Qingfeng Chen,Haojin Zeng,Jingyi Jie,Shichao Zhang,Debo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents DeNoise, a framework that detects graph-level anomalies in noisy training data using adversarial optimization and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of graph-level anomaly detection when training data is contaminated with anomalies, distorting representations and degrading performance.

Method: DeNoise incorporates an adversarial optimization framework with a graph-level encoder, attribute decoder, and structure decoder. It also introduces anchor-alignment for clean embeddings and contrastive learning for representation refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show DeNoise consistently learns reliable representations even with noise contamination, outperforming existing UGAD methods.

Conclusion: DeNoise is an effective solution for robust unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection in contaminated data, offering improved detection performance and reliability.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of graph-structured data in critical domains,
unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has become a pivotal task.
UGAD seeks to identify entire graphs that deviate from normal behavioral
patterns. However, most Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches implicitly assume
that the training set is clean, containing only normal graphs, which is rarely
true in practice. Even modest contamination by anomalous graphs can distort
learned representations and sharply degrade performance. To address this
challenge, we propose DeNoise, a robust UGAD framework explicitly designed for
contaminated training data. It jointly optimizes a graph-level encoder, an
attribute decoder, and a structure decoder via an adversarial objective to
learn noise-resistant embeddings. Further, DeNoise introduces an encoder
anchor-alignment denoising mechanism that fuses high-information node
embeddings from normal graphs into all graph embeddings, improving
representation quality while suppressing anomaly interference. A contrastive
learning component then compacts normal graph embeddings and repels anomalous
ones in the latent space. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that DeNoise consistently learns reliable graph-level
representations under varying noise intensities and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art UGAD baselines.

### [192] [KoTaP: A Panel Dataset for Corporate Tax Avoidance, Performance, and Governance in Korea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04094)
*Hyungjong Na,Wonho Song,Seungyong Han,Donghyeon Jo,Sejin Myung,Hyungjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term dataset of non-financial Korean firms, examining corporate tax avoidance and its connections to various financial and governance factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a standardized, comprehensive dataset to analyze corporate tax avoidance in Korea while enabling international and contextual comparisons.

Method: KoTaP compiles data from 1,754 firms, focusing on non-financial firms that meet specific criteria, and measures tax avoidance using multiple indicators (e.g., cash and GAAP effective tax rates).

Result: The dataset offers balanced panel structure and standardized variables, consistent with global literature but incorporating unique institutional traits of Korean firms (e.g., concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding).

Conclusion: KoTaP is a versatile tool for benchmarking models, AI analyses, and policy evaluation in accounting, finance, and interdisciplinary research, offering both global and localized analytical potential.

Abstract: This study introduces the Korean Tax Avoidance Panel (KoTaP), a long-term
panel dataset of non-financial firms listed on KOSPI and KOSDAQ between 2011
and 2024. After excluding financial firms, firms with non-December fiscal year
ends, capital impairment, and negative pre-tax income, the final dataset
consists of 12,653 firm-year observations from 1,754 firms. KoTaP is designed
to treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to
multiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),
profitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,
INVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance
itself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate
(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,
TSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is
its balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency
with international literature on the distribution and correlation of core
indicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of
Korean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and
elevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and
contextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric
and deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI
analyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment
analysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and
interdisciplinary research.

### [193] [Decomposable Neuro Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04124)
*Giorgio Morales,John W. Sheppard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decomposable symbolic regression (SR) method that uses transformers, genetic algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP) to derive interpretable multivariate expressions, outperforming existing SR methods in terms of accuracy and explanatory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SR methods often produce overly complex or inaccurate expressions as they prioritize minimizing prediction error instead of identifying governing equations.

Method: The proposed approach uses transformer models to generate univariate symbolic skeletons, refines them through genetic algorithms, and merges them incrementally using genetic programming techniques, followed by coefficient optimization.

Result: The method demonstrated lower or comparable prediction errors and consistently learned expressions matching the original mathematical structure, outperforming other SR methods in both interpolation and extrapolation accuracy.

Conclusion: This decomposable SR method effectively balances prediction accuracy and interpretability by generating mathematical expressions aligned with the original structure, addressing flaws in existing SR methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) models complex systems by discovering mathematical
expressions that capture underlying relationships in observed data. However,
most SR methods prioritize minimizing prediction error over identifying the
governing equations, often producing overly complex or inaccurate expressions.
To address this, we present a decomposable SR method that generates
interpretable multivariate expressions leveraging transformer models, genetic
algorithms (GAs), and genetic programming (GP). In particular, our explainable
SR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical
expressions that serve as explanations of its computed function. Our method
employs a Multi-Set Transformer to generate multiple univariate symbolic
skeletons that characterize how each variable influences the opaque model's
response. We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a
GA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before
incrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves
their original skeleton structure. The final multivariate skeletons undergo
coefficient optimization via a GA. We evaluated our method on problems with
controlled and varying degrees of noise, demonstrating lower or comparable
interpolation and extrapolation errors compared to two GP-based methods, three
neural SR methods, and a hybrid approach. Unlike them, our approach
consistently learned expressions that matched the original mathematical
structure.

*Hongbin Zhang,Shihao Gao,Yang Liu,Mingjie Xing,Yanjun Wu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as end-to-end compilers and presents evaluations conducted using a custom-designed framework called CompilerEval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the potential of LLMs to function as end-to-end compilers, transforming source code into target code, an area that remains underexplored despite the growing application of LLMs in software development.

Method: The study introduces the CompilerEval dataset and framework to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in source code comprehension and assembly code generation. It examines errors, proposes methods for improvement, and evaluates cross-platform compilation capabilities.

Result: Experimental results show that while LLMs exhibit basic compiler capabilities, their current compilation success rates are low. However, improvements in prompts, larger models, and reasoning methods significantly enhance assembly code quality.

Conclusion: The paper concludes optimistically about the potential of LLMs as compilers, proposing targeted training, knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure to enable paradigm shifts in compilation through high-quality assembly code generation.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) technology has shown
substantial advantages across various domains. As critical system software and
infrastructure, compilers are responsible for transforming source code into
target code. While LLMs have been leveraged to assist in compiler development
and maintenance, their potential as an end-to-end compiler remains largely
unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of LLM as a Compiler (LaaC) and
its future directions. We designed the CompilerEval dataset and framework
specifically to evaluate the capabilities of mainstream LLMs in source code
comprehension and assembly code generation. In the evaluation, we analyzed
various errors, explored multiple methods to improve LLM-generated code, and
evaluated cross-platform compilation capabilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit basic capabilities as compilers but currently
achieve low compilation success rates. By optimizing prompts, scaling up the
model, and incorporating reasoning methods, the quality of assembly code
generated by LLMs can be significantly enhanced. Based on these findings, we
maintain an optimistic outlook for LaaC and propose practical architectural
designs and future research directions. We believe that with targeted training,
knowledge-rich prompts, and specialized infrastructure, LaaC has the potential
to generate high-quality assembly code and drive a paradigm shift in the field
of compilation.

### [195] [Exchange Policy Optimization Algorithm for Semi-Infinite Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04147)
*Jiaming Zhang,Yujie Yang,Haoning Wang,Liping Zhang,Shengbo Eben Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Exchange Policy Optimization (EPO), a framework for addressing semi-infinite safe reinforcement learning (SI-safe RL) by iteratively handling constraints and optimizing policy performance while ensuring safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of semi-infinite constraints in safe reinforcement learning, especially in scenarios requiring safety across a continuous parameter space, such as resource distribution.

Method: Developed the EPO framework that iteratively adjusts the set of active constraints through expansion (violated constraints) and deletion (inactive constraints) while optimizing the policy.

Result: EPO ensures deterministic bounded safety and optimal policy performance under mild assumptions, with clear bounds on global constraint violations.

Conclusion: EPO is an effective algorithmic framework for tackling SI-safe RL problems, balancing performance optimization and maintaining safety constraints within predefined tolerances.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements
while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications,
however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as
semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when
safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space,
such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In
this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic
framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded
safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite
constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint
expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations
exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those
with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This
exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports
effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under
mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to
optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a
prescribed bound.

*Olav Finne Praesteng Larsen,Massimiliano Ruocco,Michail Spitieris,Abdulmajid Murad,Martina Ragosta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores transfer learning for adapting generative models from data-rich airports to data-scarce ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of trajectory data scarcity in regional airports affecting ATM solutions and machine learning applications.

Method: Transfer learning using state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-matching models, evaluated between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target).

Result: Diffusion-based models performed well with minimal local data (5%-20%) and other models showed variable results. Flow matching had weaker generalization.

Conclusion: Transfer learning significantly reduces data needs for trajectory generation in ATM, even for data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
"what-if" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited
historical records.

*Anzhuo Xie,Wei-Chen Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Transformer-based model to address clinical risk classification challenges with EHR data, achieving superior performance compared to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical risk classification accuracy in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by addressing challenges such as heterogeneous data, temporal irregularities, and complex semantics.

Method: The model uses multi-source medical feature embedding, learnable temporal encoding, multi-head self-attention, semantic-weighted pooling, and a linear mapping layer to generate risk scores.

Result: The proposed model outperforms traditional machine learning and deep learning methods across accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score in clinical risk classification tasks.

Conclusion: This Transformer-based approach offers a novel, efficient, and reliable solution for multi-source heterogeneous EHR data risk classification, supporting better clinical decision-making.

Abstract: This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk
identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an
efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making.

*Xiaokai Wang,Shaoyuan Huang,Yuting Li,Xiaofei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleDL, a new framework for predicting runtime in deep neural networks (DNNs), achieving high accuracy, generalizability, and lower data collection costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing runtime prediction methods lack accuracy and generalizability or incur high data collection costs due to increasing complexity in DNN workloads.

Method: ScaleDL combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network-based cross-layer interaction and uses the D-optimal method to reduce data collection costs.

Result: ScaleDL improves runtime prediction with 6x lower MRE and 5x lower RMSE compared to baseline models, as demonstrated on workloads from five popular DNN models.

Conclusion: ScaleDL effectively balances accuracy, generalizability, and cost-efficiency for DNN runtime prediction, addressing challenges in distributed computing resource optimization.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) form the cornerstone of modern AI services,
supporting a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving,
chatbots, and recommendation systems. As models increase in size and
complexity, DNN workloads like training and inference tasks impose
unprecedented demands on distributed computing resources, making the accurate
prediction of runtime essential for optimizing development and resource
allocation. Traditional methods rely on additive computational unit models,
limiting their accuracy and generalizability. In contrast, graph-enhanced
modeling improves performance but significantly increases data collection
costs. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method that strikes a balance
between accuracy, generalizability, and the costs of data collection. To
address these challenges, we propose ScaleDL, a novel runtime prediction
framework that combines nonlinear layer-wise modeling with graph neural network
(GNN)-based cross-layer interaction mechanism, enabling accurate DNN runtime
prediction and hierarchical generalizability across different network
architectures. Additionally, we employ the D-optimal method to reduce data
collection costs. Experiments on the workloads of five popular DNN models prove
that ScaleDL enhances runtime prediction accuracy and generalizability,
achieving 6$\times$ lower MRE and 5$\times$ lower RMSE compared to baseline
models.

*Yuantian Shao,Peisong Wang,Yuanteng Chen,Chang Xu,Zhihui Wei,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes post-training quantization methods in the novel MXFP4 format, identifying challenges with current techniques and introducing a block rotation strategy to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in deploying large language models efficiently due to their costly resource requirements, focusing on the challenges of accurate quantization under the newly developed MXFP4 format.

Method: A comprehensive benchmarking of existing PTQ methods is conducted under the MXFP4 format. A detailed analysis identifies incompatibilities between current rotation-based techniques and MXFP4's scaling method. Based on these insights, the authors propose a new block rotation strategy.

Result: Rotation-based methods show significant incompatibility with the MXFP4 format, but the proposed block rotation strategy enhances accuracy significantly across different LLMs.

Conclusion: The work provides improved strategies for adapting PTQ methods to the MXFP4 format and establishes foundational guidance for advancing low-precision quantization research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
rapidly growing scale imposes prohibitive costs in memory, computation, and
energy. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for efficient
deployment, yet achieving accurate W4A4 quantization remains an open challenge.
While most existing methods are designed for INT4 formats, the emergence of
MXFP4 -- a new FP4 format with various hardware support (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)--
raises questions about the applicability of current techniques. In this work,
we establish a comprehensive benchmark of PTQ methods under the MXFP4 format.
Through systematic evaluation, we find that methods like GPTQ consistently
deliver strong performance, whereas rotation-based approaches, which are almost
used by all state-of-the-art approaches, suffer from severe incompatibility
with MXFP4. We further provide the first in-depth analysis of this conflict,
tracing its root to a fundamental mismatch between MXFP4's PoT (power-of-two)
block scaling and the redistribution of outlier energy via global rotation.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective block rotation
strategy that adapts rotation-based methods to MXFP4, leading to substantial
accuracy improvements across diverse LLMs. Our findings not only offer clear
guidance for practitioners but also set a foundation for advancing PTQ research
under emerging low-precision formats.

### [200] [The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Multi-Head Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04217)
*Hikari Otsuka,Daiki Chijiwa,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Daichi Fujiki,Susumu Takeuchi,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study establishes a theoretical understanding of the presence of strong lottery tickets (SLTs) in transformer architectures, particularly focusing on multi-head attention (MHA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of the strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) in transformer architectures, especially in the context of MHA.

Method: The paper proves that a randomly initialized MHA can contain SLTs under specific conditions related to input dimensions and head numbers. It extends the SLTH concept to transformers without normalization layers and validates results empirically.

Result: The study finds that SLTs exist in MHAs if certain dimensions align, and approximation errors decrease exponentially as the hidden dimension increases in the source model.

Conclusion: The research advances the SLTH by providing a theoretical foundation for its existence within transformers and validates the findings through empirical testing, showing promise for deeper understanding of neural architectures.

Abstract: The strong lottery ticket hypothesis (SLTH) conjectures that high-performing
subnetworks, called strong lottery tickets (SLTs), are hidden in randomly
initialized neural networks. Although recent theoretical studies have
established the SLTH across various neural architectures, the SLTH for
transformer architectures still lacks theoretical understanding. In particular,
the current theory of the SLTH does not yet account for the multi-head
attention (MHA) mechanism, a core component of transformers. To address this
gap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.
We prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension
$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it
contains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input
dimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for
MHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We
empirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
approximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)
and an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the
hidden dimension of the source model.

*Rasmus Møller-Larsen,Adam Izdebski,Jan Olszewski,Pankhil Gawade,Michal Kmicikiewicz,Wojciech Zarzecki,Ewa Szczurek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces seqme, a Python library for evaluating computational methods in biological sequence design using various metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There was a lack of a unified software library to evaluate computational methods in biological sequence design across diverse metrics.

Method: The authors developed seqme, an open-source and modular Python library, offering model-agnostic metrics grouped into sequence-based, embedding-based, and property-based categories.

Result: seqme successfully implements diverse metrics for evaluation, provides embedding and property models, and includes diagnostics and visualization functions.

Conclusion: seqme is applicable to a wide range of biological sequences and supports both one-shot and iterative computational design methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational methods for designing biological sequences
have sparked the development of metrics to evaluate these methods performance
in terms of the fidelity of the designed sequences to a target distribution and
their attainment of desired properties. However, a single software library
implementing these metrics was lacking. In this work we introduce seqme, a
modular and highly extendable open-source Python library, containing
model-agnostic metrics for evaluating computational methods for biological
sequence design. seqme considers three groups of metrics: sequence-based,
embedding-based, and property-based, and is applicable to a wide range of
biological sequences: small molecules, DNA, ncRNA, mRNA, peptides and proteins.
The library offers a number of embedding and property models for biological
sequences, as well as diagnostics and visualization functions to inspect the
results. seqme can be used to evaluate both one-shot and iterative
computational design methods.

*Irene Ferfoglia,Simone Silvetti,Gaia Saveri,Laura Nenzi,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STELLE is a neuro-symbolic framework offering competitive accuracy for time series classification, paired with interpretable, logic-based explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for interpretable methods in time series classification, especially for safety-critical applications where understanding the rationale behind predictions is crucial.

Method: STELLE maps raw time series to temporal logic concepts using a novel STL-inspired kernel, enabling logic-grounded learning and providing both individual and class-level explanations.

Result: STELLE achieves competitive accuracy in real-world benchmarks while delivering human-readable explanations grounded in temporal logic.

Conclusion: STELLE unifies accuracy and interpretability in time series classification using temporal logic, offering both local and global logical explanations for predictions.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a novel approach, STELLE (Signal Temporal logic Embedding for
Logically-grounded Learning and Explanation), a neuro-symbolic framework that
unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories
into a space of temporal logic concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired
kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL
formulae, our model jointly optimises accuracy and interpretability, as each
prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that
characterise it. This yields (i) local explanations as human-readable STL
conditions justifying individual predictions, and (ii) global explanations as
class-characterising formulae. Experiments demonstrate that STELLE achieves
competitive accuracy while providing logically faithful explanations, validated
on diverse real-world benchmarks.

### [203] [Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Bayesian Preference Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04286)
*Matteo Cercola,Valeria Capretti,Simone Formentin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid framework combining RLHF's scalability and PBO's efficiency for preference learning, validated on two domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference learning from human judgments is costly and time-consuming, necessitating efficient approaches.

Method: A hybrid framework combining RLHF with PBO, incorporating acquisition-driven modules for active and efficient preference data gathering.

Result: Experimental results in two domains show consistent improvements in sample efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances preference learning efficiency while maintaining high performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning
models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is
often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient
learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages:
RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning,
while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We
propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query
efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline,
thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate
the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional
preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall
performance across these tasks.

### [204] [Differentially Private In-Context Learning with Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04332)
*Antti Koskela,Tejas Kulkarni,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) by integrating privacy-aware nearest neighbor search, achieving superior results compared to existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The privacy risks of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) have been identified, but the critical front-end pipeline component, similarity search for context retrieval, has not been adequately explored in prior works.

Method: The proposed method integrates nearest neighbor retrieval and a privacy filter within the large language model's in-context learning pipeline for privacy-aware data retrieval. The privacy filter tracks cumulative privacy costs and ensures adherence to a differential privacy budget.

Result: Experimental evaluations on text classification and document question answering benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in privacy-utility trade-offs compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The integration of privacy-aware nearest neighbor search enhances differentially private in-context learning, offering improved privacy and utility.

Abstract: Differentially private in-context learning (DP-ICL) has recently become an
active research topic due to the inherent privacy risks of in-context learning.
However, existing approaches overlook a critical component of modern large
language model (LLM) pipelines: the similarity search used to retrieve relevant
context data. In this work, we introduce a DP framework for in-context learning
that integrates nearest neighbor search of relevant examples in a privacy-aware
manner. Our method outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin
across all evaluated benchmarks, achieving more favorable privacy-utility
trade-offs. To achieve this, we employ nearest neighbor retrieval from a
database of context data, combined with a privacy filter that tracks the
cumulative privacy cost of selected samples to ensure adherence to a central
differential privacy budget. Experimental results on text classification and
document question answering show a clear advantage of the proposed method over
existing baselines.

### [205] [LUME-DBN: Full Bayesian Learning of DBNs from Incomplete data in Intensive Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04333)
*Federico Pirola,Fabio Stella,Marco Grzegorczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Gibbs sampling-based method for learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) from incomplete data was proposed, offering improved accuracy for imputation and uncertainty estimation in healthcare datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to handling missing data in DBNs for healthcare fail to adequately account for the temporal aspect of the data, limiting model reliability in high-stakes settings like intensive care.

Method: The method uses Gibbs sampling and treats missing values as Gaussian-distributed unknown parameters, sampling unobserved values iteratively to enable principled imputation and uncertainty estimation.

Result: The proposed method showed superior reconstruction accuracy and better convergence compared to standard techniques like MICE, when applied to simulated and real-world intensive care datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating full Bayesian inference into DBNs enhances reliability for healthcare applications, particularly in contexts with frequent missing data, supporting safer clinical decision-making through improved imputations and insights into model behavior.

Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) are increasingly used in healthcare due to
their ability to model complex temporal relationships in patient data while
maintaining interpretability, an essential feature for clinical
decision-making. However, existing approaches to handling missing data in
longitudinal clinical datasets are largely derived from static Bayesian
networks literature, failing to properly account for the temporal nature of the
data. This gap limits the ability to quantify uncertainty over time, which is
particularly critical in settings such as intensive care, where understanding
the temporal dynamics is fundamental for model trustworthiness and
applicability across diverse patient groups. Despite the potential of DBNs, a
full Bayesian framework that integrates missing data handling remains
underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a novel Gibbs sampling-based method
for learning DBNs from incomplete data. Our method treats each missing value as
an unknown parameter following a Gaussian distribution. At each iteration, the
unobserved values are sampled from their full conditional distributions,
allowing for principled imputation and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our
method on both simulated datasets and real-world intensive care data from
critically ill patients. Compared to standard model-agnostic techniques such as
MICE, our Bayesian approach demonstrates superior reconstruction accuracy and
convergence properties. These results highlight the clinical relevance of
incorporating full Bayesian inference in temporal models, providing more
reliable imputations and offering deeper insight into model behavior. Our
approach supports safer and more informed clinical decision-making,
particularly in settings where missing data are frequent and potentially
impactful.

*Subeen Park,Joowang Kim,Hakyung Lee,Sunjae Yoo,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCER, a technique to enhance deep learning models' robustness by reducing reliance on spurious correlations, thus improving accuracy in underrepresented groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models' reliance on spurious correlations leads to vulnerability in distribution shifts, especially in underrepresented subpopulations.

Method: Proposed SCER (Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization), a theoretical embedding-level regularization technique that suppresses spurious cues and promotes reliance on core features identified through group-wise mean embeddings.

Result: SCER demonstrates superior performance in worst-group accuracy across multiple vision and language benchmarks, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SCER effectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations, improving model robustness to distribution shifts and offering a theoretically sound approach to address underrepresented subpopulations.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance across various domains but
often rely on spurious correlations, making them vulnerable to distribution
shifts. This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,
where models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have
made progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still
constrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the
embedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this
limitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for
Worst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes
feature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that
worst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on
spurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean
embeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at
the embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while
reducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on
multiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior
state-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy. Our code is available at

*Tim Tomov,Dominik Fuchsgruber,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to perform adequately on ambiguous data, despite success on unambiguous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the limitations in current UQ methods for LLMs, which fail to provide reliable performance when applied to ambiguous real-world tasks.

Method: They developed two new datasets, MAQA* and AmbigQA*, which include ambiguous question-answering data and ground-truth answer distributions based on factual co-occurrence. Various UQ techniques were evaluated to assess their performance on ambiguous data.

Result: Performance of existing UQ estimators significantly deteriorates on ambiguous data, across different estimation paradigms such as predictive distribution, internal representations, and ensembles.

Conclusion: Current uncertainty quantification methods are insufficient for handling the intrinsic ambiguity of real-world tasks, highlighting the need for new modeling paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is
critical for trustworthy deployment. While real-world language is inherently
ambiguous, reflecting aleatoric uncertainty, existing UQ methods are typically
benchmarked against tasks with no ambiguity. In this work, we demonstrate that
while current uncertainty estimators perform well under the restrictive
assumption of no ambiguity, they degrade to close-to-random performance on
ambiguous data. To this end, we introduce MAQA* and AmbigQA*, the first
ambiguous question-answering (QA) datasets equipped with ground-truth answer
distributions estimated from factual co-occurrence. We find this performance
deterioration to be consistent across different estimation paradigms: using the
predictive distribution itself, internal representations throughout the model,
and an ensemble of models. We show that this phenomenon can be theoretically
explained, revealing that predictive-distribution and ensemble-based estimators
are fundamentally limited under ambiguity. Overall, our study reveals a key
shortcoming of current UQ methods for LLMs and motivates a rethinking of
current modeling paradigms.

*Jayadeva,Naman Dwivedi,Hari Krishnan,N. M. Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a connection between regression and classification by demonstrating equivalence between regression on hyperplanes and linearly separable classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between regression and classification, and to introduce new tools for analyzing and solving regression problems.

Method: The authors establish theoretical equivalence between regression on a hyperplane with M samples and linear classification with 2M samples. This equivalence is used to derive a new regression formulation and develop methodologies such as regressability measures and neural network-based linearizing maps.

Result: Demonstrated new regression formulation from margin maximization, introduced a measure for regressability, and advanced neural network training for linearizing mappings.

Conclusion: This paper reveals fundamental connections between regression and classification, introducing novel tools and methods that may improve regression analysis and training processes.

Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector
regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
regressor is adequate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two algorithms for decentralized nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise, achieving a convergence rate with theoretical guarantees and validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-tailed noise poses a challenge to the bounded variance assumption in nonconvex stochastic optimization, especially in federated learning scenarios where such noise is prevalent.

Method: The authors propose two algorithms, Fed-NSGDA-M using normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA utilizing the Muon optimizer for local updates, to improve convergence under heavy-tailed noise.

Result: Both algorithms achieved a convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$, which are supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experimentation proving their effectiveness.

Conclusion: This study introduces the first federated minimax optimization algorithms that handle heavy-tailed noise effectively with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Heavy-tailed noise has attracted growing attention in nonconvex stochastic
optimization, as numerous empirical studies suggest it offers a more realistic
assumption than standard bounded variance assumption. In this work, we
investigate nonconvex-PL minimax optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise
in federated learning. We propose two novel algorithms: Fed-NSGDA-M, which
integrates normalized gradients, and FedMuon-DA, which leverages the Muon
optimizer for local updates. Both algorithms are designed to effectively
address heavy-tailed noise in federated minimax optimization, under a milder
condition. We theoretically establish that both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O({1}/{(TNp)^{\frac{s-1}{2s}}})$. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first federated minimax optimization algorithms with
rigorous theoretical guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Extensive experiments
further validate their effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel generative model for generating synthetic financial time series data while preserving causal relationships, enabling counterfactual analysis and risk assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep generative models for financial data lack causal reasoning capabilities needed for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment.

Method: The proposed method, TNCM-VAE, combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models, using directed acyclic graphs and causal Wasserstein distance for training.

Result: The model demonstrates superior accuracy in counterfactual probability estimation on synthetic financial data with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth.

Conclusion: TNCM-VAE supports financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating realistic market trajectories respecting causal mechanisms.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of benchmarking KG retrieval methods caused by the lack of QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.

Method: The authors developed SynthKGQA to generate synthetic QA datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing comprehensive ground-truth facts for reasoning over each query.

Result: SynthKGQA was applied to generate GTSQA from Wikidata, testing KG retrievers' zero-shot generalization ability on unseen graph structures and relations. Benchmarking popular KG-augmented LLMs demonstrated its utility.

Conclusion: SynthKGQA facilitates more accurate benchmarking of KG retrievers and enhances model training, demonstrating potential for improving LLM factuality leveraging KBs.

Abstract: Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a
promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various
solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the
lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval.
We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic
Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing
the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We
show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG
retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better
models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset
designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with
respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular
solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.

*Ipsita Ghosh,Ethan Nguyen,Christian Kümmerle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q3R, a new method for low-rank model training focused on improving low-rank pre-training tasks. This approach enhances performance with minimal computational cost while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the need to improve low-rank pre-training tasks, as traditional methods fail to efficiently maintain low-rank structures and meet objectives during these processes.

Method: The proposed Q3R method utilizes a quadratic reweighted rank regularizer inspired by the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) framework. It employs a quadratic regularization term to approximate a smoothed log determinant for inducing low-rank structures during training.

Result: Q3R achieves competitive performance compared to dense models with reduced parameter count and computational overhead. For example, it reduces parameters of ViT-Tiny by 60% and 80% with minor accuracy drops of ~1.3% and ~4% on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Q3R demonstrates the ability to enable low-rank training for large models, achieving comparable performance to standard dense counterparts with enhanced compatibility for various tasks, especially in Transformers for image and language applications.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient training, based on low-rank optimization, has become a
highly successful tool for fine-tuning large deep-learning models. However,
these methods fail at low-rank pre-training tasks where maintaining the
low-rank structure and the objective remains a challenging task. We propose the
Quadratic Reweighted Rank Regularizer dubbed Q3R, which leads to a novel
low-rank inducing training strategy inspired by the iteratively reweighted
least squares (IRLS) framework. Q3R is based on a quadratic regularizer term
which majorizes a smoothed log determinant serving as rank surrogate objective.
Unlike other low-rank training techniques, Q3R is able to train weight matrices
with prescribed, low target ranks of models that achieve comparable predictive
performance as dense models, with small computational overhead, while remaining
fully compatible with existing architectures. For example, we demonstrated one
experiment where we are able to truncate $60\%$ and $80\%$ of the parameters of
a ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\%$ and $~4\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance
respectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both
image and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning.

*Alper Kalle,Theo Rudkiewicz,Mohamed-Oumar Ouerfelli,Mohamed Tamaazousti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel compression method for neural networks that optimizes error in function space using data-informed norms, achieving competitive accuracy without post-compression fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks require significant computational resources, and the goal is to reduce their memory and computing footprint through efficient compression methods.

Method: Compression via tensorization and low-rank representations with a data-informed norm that minimizes changes in layer output distributions. Algorithms like Tucker-2 and CPD are optimized using a covariance-based norm.

Result: The proposed method achieves competitive accuracy without fine-tuning and shows transferability across datasets with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments confirm effectiveness on architectures like ResNet and GoogLeNet, and various datasets including ImageNet and CIFAR.

Conclusion: The covariance-based data-informed norm introduces a promising direction for neural network compression, offering efficiency and robustness without relying on fine-tuning or original training datasets.

Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand
considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its
memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we
focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.
Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing
an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use
data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we
minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed
as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is
the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,
$\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new
alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor
decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike
conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require
post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves
competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same
covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only
a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training
dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50,
and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100)
confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

*Shaolong Wu,James Blume,Geshi Yeung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores algorithmic fairness, conflicts in its concepts, and introduces an adjusted group fairness method to balance ethical error considerations while maintaining practical applicability in public decision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper lies in addressing unsettled concepts of algorithmic fairness within criminal justice systems, aiming to make the systems more transparent, accountable, and equitable.

Method: The authors introduce a weighted error loss minimization approach, focusing on reducing the disparity between false negative rates across protected groups while increasing predictive accuracy.

Result: The paper highlights the advantages of the proposed method in facilitating solution discovery, improving predictive accuracy, and showcasing ethical considerations in error cost allocation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a practical framework for deploying algorithmic fairness in public systems, emphasizing need-based decisions, transparency, accountability, and tailored definitions to enhance legitimacy and fairness.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has grown rapidly as a research area, yet key concepts
remain unsettled, especially in criminal justice. We review group, individual,
and process fairness and map the conditions under which they conflict. We then
develop a simple modification to standard group fairness. Rather than exact
parity across protected groups, we minimize a weighted error loss while keeping
differences in false negative rates within a small tolerance. This makes
solutions easier to find, can raise predictive accuracy, and surfaces the
ethical choice of error costs. We situate this proposal within three classes of
critique: biased and incomplete data, latent affirmative action, and the
explosion of subgroup constraints. Finally, we offer a practical framework for
deployment in public decision systems built on three pillars: need-based
decisions, Transparency and accountability, and narrowly tailored definitions
and solutions. Together, these elements link technical design to legitimacy and
provide actionable guidance for agencies that use risk assessment and related
tools.

TL;DR: This paper explores linear mode connectivity (LMC) in deep learning, focusing on its relationship with noisy gradients, smooth minima, and generalization under data shifts. It identifies conditions for mitigating data shift impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how linear mode connectivity (LMC) interacts with training stability, model similarity, data shifts, and architectural effects, and address challenges posed by data shift-induced noisy gradients.

Method: Experiments are conducted to analyze LMC under data shifts by treating them as sources of gradient noise. Techniques like reduced learning rates and increased batch sizes are used to minimize this noise and study its effect on model convergence.

Result: LMC helps models converge to either shared minima or smooth regions in the loss landscape, aiding generalization. Models leveraging LMC tend to balance training efficiency with improved ensemble diversity.

Conclusion: Linear mode connectivity is valuable in balancing training efficiency against ensemble diversity and supports smooth convergence under controlled training parameters.

Abstract: The phenomenon of linear mode connectivity (LMC) links several aspects of
deep learning, including training stability under noisy stochastic gradients,
the smoothness and generalization of local minima (basins), the similarity and
functional diversity of sampled models, and architectural effects on data
processing. In this work, we experimentally study LMC under data shifts and
identify conditions that mitigate their impact. We interpret data shifts as an
additional source of stochastic gradient noise, which can be reduced through
small learning rates and large batch sizes. These parameters influence whether
models converge to the same local minimum or to regions of the loss landscape
with varying smoothness and generalization. Although models sampled via LMC
tend to make similar errors more frequently than those converging to different
basins, the benefit of LMC lies in balancing training efficiency against the
gains achieved from larger, more diverse ensembles. Code and supplementary
materials will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DLR-KI/LMC in
due course.

### [216] [End-to-End Reinforcement Learning of Koopman Models for eNMPC of an Air Separation Unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04522)
*Daniel Mayfrank,Kayra Dernek,Laura Lang,Alexander Mitsos,Manuel Dahmen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces and evaluates a method using reinforcement learning to train Koopman surrogate models for optimal performance in economic nonlinear model predictive control, applying it to a large-scale air separation unit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previously demonstrated methods by scaling them to more challenging, real-world nonlinear model predictive control scenarios, improving economic performance while respecting constraints.

Method: The authors used reinforcement learning to train Koopman surrogate models tailored for economic nonlinear model predictive control tasks, focusing on a large-scale air separation unit with limited observable variables in the experiments.

Result: The proposed method provides comparable economic performance to traditional Koopman eNMPC approaches but avoids frequent constraint violations, demonstrating scalability and enhanced reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning-based approach successfully scales to large, real-world cases, ensuring both economic efficiency and compliance with operational constraints.

Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank
et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained
for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive
control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been
demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method
scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a
large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across
all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically
measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based
Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates
constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding
constraint violations.

*Jonas E. Katona,Emily K. de Jong,Nipun Gunawardena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space reduced-order models (ROMs), using conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification methods for reduced-order models are currently specific to architectures or trainings, limiting their flexibility and generalization.

Method: The introduced framework uses conformal prediction to provide statistical prediction intervals for various components of the ROM pipeline, without altering its architecture or training procedure.

Result: The framework was applied to a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, accurately predicting droplet-size distributions and enabling uncertainty quantification across the ROM pipeline.

Conclusion: This approach offers a flexible and generalizable method for uncertainty quantification in reduced-order models without requiring modifications to existing models or training processes.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.

### [218] [Integrating Temporal and Structural Context in Graph Transformers for Relational Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04557)
*Divyansha Lachi,Mahmoud Mohammadi,Joe Meyer,Vinam Arora,Tom Palczewski,Eva L. Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel graph transformer model called Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP) and a temporal subgraph sampler to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in relational data for multi-task prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph models inadequately address temporal dynamics in relational data, focusing only on spatial structure and single-task prediction, while domains like healthcare, finance, and e-commerce require models to integrate diverse spatial-temporal dependencies and support multiple predictive tasks.

Method: The paper presents a temporal subgraph sampler to capture temporally relevant relationships and the Relational Graph Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer leveraging a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck for integrating spatial and temporal contexts. A cross-attention decoder is included for multi-task learning.

Result: Experiments on datasets like RelBench, SALT, and CTU demonstrate RGP's state-of-the-art performance in relational deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RGP model offers a scalable and general solution for modeling spatial-temporal dependencies and multi-task learning in relational data, addressing limitations of previous graph models.

Abstract: In domains such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, the temporal dynamics
of relational data emerge from complex interactions-such as those between
patients and providers, or users and products across diverse categories. To be
broadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range
spatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also
supporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for
relational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal
information merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather
than a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.
To address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances
global context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture
temporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph
Perceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning
that leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently
integrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent
bottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common
latent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire
relational system. RGP also incorporates a flexible cross-attention decoder
that supports joint learning across tasks with disjoint label spaces within a
single model. Experiments on RelBench, SALT, and CTU show that RGP delivers
state-of-the-art performance, offering a general and scalable solution for
relational deep learning with support for diverse predictive tasks.

*Vasco V. Branco,Jandó Benedek,Lidia Pivovarova,Luís Correia,Pedro Cardoso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARETE, an R package that uses AI to efficiently extract species occurrence data from a variety of sources, providing significant conservation insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of accessible species occurrence data limits conservation efforts, especially with the increasing pace of anthropogenic changes.

Method: The method involves creating ARETE, an R package using large language models and APIs to automate species occurrence data extraction while validating the results against human annotations.

Result: Testing ARETE on spiders revealed a significant expansion in known species ranges, enhancing data accessibility for spatial conservation planning.

Conclusion: ARETE revolutionizes species data extraction, enabling faster access to crucial information while improving conservation planning and risk assessment efficiency.

Abstract: 1. A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is
our lack of key species data, especially occurrence data. Furthermore,
researchers have to contend with an accelerated speed at which new information
must be collected and processed due to anthropogenic activity. Publications
ranging from scientific papers to gray literature contain this crucial
information but their data are often not machine-readable, requiring extensive
human work to be retrieved. 2. We present the ARETE R package, an open-source
software aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by
large language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming
Interface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and
validation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers
and output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic
comparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced
using GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of
spiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence
by a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were
found in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial
conservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster
access to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in
projects requiring such data. Researchers will be able to better prioritize
resources, manually verifying selected species while maintaining automated
extraction for the majority. This workflow also allows predicting available
bibliographic data during project planning.

*Oshri Naparstek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Complexity as Advantage (CAA) as a framework for assessing complexity relative to various observers, focusing on how it impacts predictive regret and information advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine complexity not as a standalone property but in relation to how different observers experience predictive difficulty while modeling a system.

Method: Introduce CAA framework, utilizing concepts of multiscale entropy, predictive information, and observer-dependent analysis to evaluate systems' behavior.

Result: Unified notions of emergent behavior are provided, highlighting how systems create differentiated predictive regret among observers.

Conclusion: Complexity is valuable when systems induce varying predictive regret across observers, offering insights into learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

Abstract: We introduce Complexity as Advantage (CAA), a framework that defines the
complexity of a system relative to a family of observers. Instead of measuring
complexity as an intrinsic property, we evaluate how much predictive regret a
system induces for different observers attempting to model it. A system is
complex when it is easy for some observers and hard for others, creating an
information advantage. We show that this formulation unifies several notions of
emergent behavior, including multiscale entropy, predictive information, and
observer-dependent structure. The framework suggests that "interesting" systems
are those positioned to create differentiated regret across observers,
providing a quantitative grounding for why complexity can be functionally
valuable. We demonstrate the idea through simple dynamical models and discuss
implications for learning, evolution, and artificial agents.

### [221] [Regret Lower Bounds for Decentralized Multi-Agent Stochastic Shortest Path Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04594)
*Utkarsh U. Chavan,Prashant Trivedi,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores decentralized multi-agent Stochastic Shortest Path problems (Dec-MASSPs) with linear function approximation and provides a regret lower bound, revealing learning complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized multi-agent systems face challenges in learning optimal policies for coordination under stochastic frameworks. The paper aims to address the unexplored area of multi-agent SSPs.

Method: The authors use symmetry-based arguments to determine the structure of optimal policies in Dec-MASSPs and construct hard-to-learn instances to establish regret lower bounds.

Result: The paper identifies a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$ over $K$ episodes, demonstrating the inherent difficulty in learning for Dec-MASSPs.

Conclusion: These findings enhance understanding of the learning complexity in decentralized multi-agent control and provide a foundation for designing efficient algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are central to applications such as swarm robotics
and traffic routing, where agents must coordinate in a decentralized manner to
achieve a common objective. Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a
natural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While
the problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent
settings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized
multi-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the
transition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying
novel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.
Our main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on
the construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our
regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the
inherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs. These insights clarify the learning
complexity of decentralized control and can further guide the design of
efficient learning algorithms in multi-agent systems.

*Hampus Åström,Elin Anna Topp,Jacek Malec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores transforming standard reinforcement learning into goal-conditioned environments to enable autonomous, reward-free task solving, with average goal success rates improved during experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable agents to autonomously learn tasks without relying on rewards or external guidance.

Method: The paper proposes transforming reinforcement learning environments into goal-conditioned ones, allowing agents to choose their own goals in an environment-agnostic way. Their method works independently of off-policy learning algorithms.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved and stabilized average goal success rates, although performance for individual goals may remain unstable.

Conclusion: The proposed approach allows agents to generically train for diverse tasks without prior specific use cases, facilitating versatile and autonomous learning.

Abstract: In this paper we study how transforming regular reinforcement learning
environments into goal-conditioned environments can let agents learn to solve
tasks autonomously and reward-free. We show that an agent can learn to solve
tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training
times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is
independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method
is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others,
leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our
experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and
stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any
observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior
to specific use cases.

### [223] [Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638)
*Satchel Grant,Simon Jerome Han,Alexa Tartaglini,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability of causal intervention techniques for mechanistic interpretability, highlights concerns about out-of-distribution divergences created during interventions, and proposes modifications to mitigate harmful effects while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to ensure that causal interventions used for understanding model representations do not create unfaithful or divergent representations that undermine the reliability of the explanations.

Method: Empirical demonstrations and theoretical analysis of divergences caused by interventions, categorizing divergences into 'harmless' and 'pernicious' types. Additionally, the study modifies the Counterfactual Latent (CL) loss to reduce harmful divergences during interventions.

Result: Common intervention techniques cause divergences in internal representations. Interventions can lead to harmless or harmful divergences, with pernicious ones activating unintended pathways and behaviors. A modified CL method successfully mitigates pernicious divergences while preserving interpretability.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the importance of cautious and refined approaches to causal interventions for mechanistic interpretability and demonstrates how regularization techniques can enhance reliability without compromising explanatory power.

Abstract: A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate
model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what
those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create
out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises
concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common
causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away
from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a
theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences
that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within
behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate
hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an
effort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent
(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to
the natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while
preserving the interpretive power of interventions. Together, these results
highlight a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

*Hans Harder,Abhijeet Vishwasrao,Luca Guastoni,Ricardo Vinuesa,Sebastian Peitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores probabilistic forecasting methods for physical systems governed by partial differential equations, focusing on techniques to reduce sampling steps and conducting experiments for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the forecasting of dynamical systems described by PDEs, emphasizing efficient processing and prediction techniques for large-scale simulations.

Method: It compares multiple advanced probabilistic techniques including direct and progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs, and rectified flows.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in challenging systems and facilitate efficient prediction of 2D slices in 3D simulations.

Conclusion: The research contributes to effective probabilistic forecasting and paves the way for generating efficient inflows for solvers in high-dimensional simulations.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.

### [225] [Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647)
*Sitan Chen,Kevin Cong,Jerry Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advances understanding and proposes new bounds for diffusion language models, specifically the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), allowing for faster token sampling with minimal degradation in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auto-regressive language models have slow, sequential inference, limiting practicality. Diffusion language models like MDM offer parallel token sampling, but their performance-impact trade-offs remain poorly understood.

Method: The study provides an exact characterization of the expected divergence between true and sampled distributions using univariate function approximation theory. It derives rigorous new bounds, explores sampling schedules, and analyzes their performance under information-theoretic properties, such as total correlation.

Result: New upper and lower bounds for sampling schedules are identified. The findings show that, in specific settings, sampling can be achieved in $O(log n)$ steps with negligible performance degradation.

Conclusion: The paper reveals that optimal unmasking schedules for MDM can be theoretically achieved but require prior knowledge of distributions; practical schedules can still perform well in natural settings with logarithmic sampling steps.

Abstract: A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.

*Xinlu Zhang,Yansha Deng,Toktam Mahmoodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces adaptive model pruning in time-triggered federated learning to optimize training efficiency, demonstrating a reduction in communication costs by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like communication overhead and device stragglers in large-scale federated learning systems using limited wireless bandwidth.

Method: Conduct convergence analysis on the gradient l_2 norm under model pruning and formulate a joint optimization problem for pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation, solved with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

Result: Model pruning reduces communication costs by 40% while maintaining comparable model performance.

Conclusion: Integrating adaptive model pruning into wireless time-triggered FL systems is effective in minimizing training loss, latency, and communication overhead.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D precipitation nowcasting framework using volumetric radar data combined with physically constrained neural operators and data-driven learning, achieving accurate and reliable forecasts up to three hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for extreme precipitation nowcasting lack either speed, precision, or the ability to effectively process vertical dynamics of evolving weather systems.

Method: The framework utilizes volumetric radar data for processing 3D dynamics and integrates conservative advection operators, spatially varying diffusion, stochastic modeling, and residual branches to enhance forecasting capabilities.

Result: Improved nowcasting accuracy for lead times of up to three hours across various precipitation conditions, with superior performance in blind evaluations conducted by meteorologists.

Conclusion: The introduced gray-box 3D framework offers scalable, reliable, and physically consistent precipitation nowcasting with enhanced accuracy, filling gaps in existing methodologies.

Abstract: Extreme precipitation nowcasting demands high spatiotemporal fidelity and
extended lead times, yet existing approaches remain limited. Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) and its deep-learning emulations are too slow and coarse for
rapidly evolving convection, while extrapolation and purely data-driven models
suffer from error accumulation and excessive smoothing. Hybrid 2D radar-based
methods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate
reconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully
three-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar
reflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with
datadriven learning. The model learns vertically varying 3D advection fields
under a conservative advection operator, parameterizes spatially varying
diffusion, and introduces a Brownian-motion--inspired stochastic term to
represent unresolved motions. A residual branch captures small-scale convective
initiation and microphysical variability, while a diffusion-based stochastic
module estimates uncertainty. The framework achieves more accurate forecasts up
to three-hour lead time across precipitation regimes and ranked first in 57\%
of cases in a blind evaluation by 160 meteorologists. By restoring full 3D
dynamics with physical consistency, it offers a scalable and robust pathway for
skillful and reliable nowcasting of extreme precipitation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates a mathematics placement exam through multi-methods, finds issues in item discrimination, identifies optimal predictors, validates machine learning and clustering approaches, and recommends methods for exam refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to optimize mathematics placement exams using a rigorous multi-method framework to improve their discriminatory power and placement accuracy.

Method: Classical Test Theory, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering were integrated to analyze the exam. Key items were assessed for discrimination, and algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and clustering methods like K-means were used.

Result: 55% of items showed excellent discrimination, while 30% needed replacement. Machine learning models achieved high accuracy (up to 97.5%). Clustering revealed deviations from established competency boundaries, with stable binary segmentation.

Conclusion: A multi-method approach strengthens placement exams by identifying weak items, leveraging machine learning predictions, introducing two-stage assessments, and suggesting alignment with empirical evidence for better accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \geq 0.40$)
while 30\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.
Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful
discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA
F-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance
(0.206), accounting for 20.6\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms
demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
achieving 97.5\% and 96.0\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering
identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\%,
diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\% and suggesting potential
overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits
exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster
purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:
replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and
integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These
findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical
foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of evolutionary algorithms, specifically sep-CMA-ES, for optimizing image generation in diffusion models, outperforming traditional optimization methods like Adam, and enhancing aesthetic and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for image generation are powerful but lack controllability and optimization methods without expensive retraining. Evolutionary algorithms have shown promise in optimizing image generation, motivating their exploration within these models.

Method: The study compares sep-CMA-ES (an evolutionary optimization method) to Adam for optimizing prompt embedding vectors in Stable Diffusion XL Turbo. Image evaluation metrics include LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 and CLIPScore in a weighted fitness function.

Result: Experimental results on the Parti Prompts dataset show that sep-CMA-ES delivers superior aesthetic and alignment metrics compared to Adam, offering effective gradient-free optimization.

Conclusion: Evolutionary methods like sep-CMA-ES enable efficient optimization of deep generative models, improving image generation controllability without retraining, and offer promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed
image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for
specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration,
especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising
method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models.
Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary
optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation
(Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The
evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore
into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual
appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts
(P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements
in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that
the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for
diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning.
This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space
exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evolution schemas were ineffective in solving the d-resource optimization problem due to a strict feasibility function, highlighting the need for adapted strategies.

Method: The study introduces adaptations to classical genetic algorithms, including the use of a migration operator inspired by biological random genetic drift.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforced genetic approach effectively overcomes the constraints of traditional evolution schemas in optimizing complex resource systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforced genetic approach to a defined d-resource

### [231] [Neural Computation Without Slots: Steps Towards Biologically Plausible Memory and Attention in Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04593)
*Shaunak Bhandarkar,James L. McClelland*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores how biological brains achieve functionalities similar to slot-based patterns in AI models using neurally-inspired approaches, proposing enhancements to the Hopfield network for better memory and language model functioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological brains likely lack slot-based storage seen in digital systems, prompting investigation into neural mechanisms that achieve similar functional capabilities.

Method: The study introduces the K-winner MHN, extending standard MHN to ensembles to mimic memory storage in overlapping sparse neural ensembles. Additionally, MHNs are modified to emulate slot-based memory in language models.

Result: The K-winner model outperforms the standard MHN in memory retention under continual learning conditions. The modified MHN is better at mimicking slot-based memory in language models, supporting sequence-based computations.

Conclusion: The proposed extensions to MHN provide a biologically plausible framework for achieving tasks similar to those of slot-based AI models, enabling a deeper understanding of human-like machine abilities.

Abstract: Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on
multi-element patterns stored in "slots" - dedicated storage locations - in a
digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they
might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the
neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which
stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose
extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model
of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in
contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that
the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated
individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN,
extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning
regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as
measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron)
MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary
language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs
and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error
signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the
learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we
show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional
outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards
understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations
that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior
models have been able to achieve.

*Marcelo P. Fiore,Ohad Kammar,Georg Moser,Sam Staton*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper extends the concept of abstract syntax and substitution to handle languages with second-class sorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the needs of programming calculi, such as Call-by-Value lambda-calculus and Call-by-Push-Value, that require specific handling of second-class sorts in abstract syntax.

Method: The authors extend Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's framework for abstract syntax by integrating bicategorical arguments and modeling abstract syntax through actions in actegories instead of monoids in monoidal categories.

Result: The study provides a modified theoretical framework and proves substitution lemmas for Call-by-Value lambda-calculus and its varieties.

Conclusion: The extension successfully accommodates second-class sorts within abstract syntax, offering a robust framework for relevant programming calculi.

Abstract: We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's treatment of abstract syntax with
binding, substitution, and holes to account for languages with second-class
sorts. These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value
lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting
second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the
characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to
actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through
bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution
lemmata for varieties of CBV.

*Iman Adibnazari,Harsh Sharma,Myungsun Park,Jacobo Cervera-Torralba,Boris Kramer,Michael T. Tolley*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares data-driven model reduction techniques for linear models to improve dynamic shape control of soft robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots struggle with dynamic body control due to high-dimensional dynamics and the absence of suitable modeling tools for control.

Method: The study compares three model reduction techniques: eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method.

Result: LOpInf-based model showed the lowest tracking errors in experiments across simulated, biological, and physical analog trajectories.

Conclusion: LOpInf is the most effective model reduction technique for dynamic shape control in soft robots.

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

*Yushi Wang,Changsheng Luo,Penghui Chen,Jianran Liu,Weijian Sun,Tong Guo,Kechang Yang,Biao Hu,Yangang Zhang,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified reinforcement learning-based controller for humanoid soccer robots, integrating visual perception with motion control to achieve dynamic, reactive behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid soccer robot systems rely on decoupled modules, leading to delayed responses and ineffective behaviors, particularly in real-world dynamic environments with perceptual limitations.

Method: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach using an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception system that models real-world visual characteristics. This method extends Adversarial Motion Priors for dynamic control, linking motion imitation to visually grounded control.

Result: The controller ensures robust and coherent soccer behaviors, exhibiting strong reactivity across varying scenarios, including successful performance in real RoboCup matches.

Conclusion: The integration of visual perception and motion control via reinforcement learning enables humanoid soccer robots to achieve effective reactive and robust behaviors in real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

*Chenzui Li,Yiming Chen,Xi Wu,Giacinto Barresi,Fei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to optimize human postures during bimanual human-robot collaboration tasks to improve ergonomics and force manipulability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate physical safety and manipulative efficiency in bimanual human-robot co-carrying tasks.

Method: The joint angles of a human skeleton model are optimized for safety and capability, guiding humans to the optimal posture using a transformation module and validated through experimental human-human and human-robot collaboration scenarios.

Result: Experimental results showed improved muscle activation conditions after optimization during collaboration tasks.

Conclusion: The method enhances both ergonomics and manipulative efficiency during human-robot collaboration, supporting diverse human postures and object interactions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

### [236] [An LLM-based Framework for Human-Swarm Teaming Cognition in Disaster Search and Rescue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04042)
*Kailun Ji,Xiaoyu Hu,Xinyu Zhang,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve UAV swarm coordination in search and rescue missions, reducing task time, error rate, and cognitive workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR operations face difficulty due to challenging terrains and disrupted communication, making UAV swarm coordination complex and cognitively taxing for human operators.

Method: The study proposes a LLM-CRF system using LLMs to interpret operator intentions, decompose tasks, plan missions, and enable real-time feedback while minimizing manual inputs.

Result: Simulation results show 64.2% reduction in task completion time, 7% increase in task success rate, and 42.9% decrease in cognitive workload compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential to enhance human-swarm collaboration, offering efficient, intuitive solutions in high-pressure disaster rescue scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates advanced processors for autonomous planetary exploration missions, achieving significant performance improvements and introducing a fault-tolerant mechanism called ARBITER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the increasing demands for high-performance, reliable, and autonomous computing required for future planetary exploration missions during critical phases like Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).

Method: The study deploys GNC and LVS algorithms on advanced multi-core processors (HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx Versal) and introduces the ARBITER mechanism for fault detection and correction. It also conducts a fault injection study for refinement.

Result: The new processors deliver up to 15x speedup for image processing and over 250x speedup for trajectory optimization. ARBITER ensures computational reliability, identifying critical sensitivities and implementing protection strategies.

Conclusion: This research presents a robust and efficient computational framework ideal for future planetary exploration missions, addressing both performance and fault tolerance needs.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient
architecture for future missions, including Mars Sample Return, Enceladus
Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and
fault resilience are critical.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Spiking Neural Network-based biomimetic control framework, inspired by the Central Nervous System, for agile robotic arm manipulation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic arm control algorithms struggle to handle complex, dynamic environments like healthcare and daily life where adaptability and agility are critical.

Method: The framework uses Spiking Neural Networks with five modules — cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord — and three hierarchical control levels to mimic human neural control mechanisms.

Result: The system was tested in real and simulated environments, showing superior manipulation agility compared to industrial-grade position control.

Conclusion: The biomimetic SNN approach enhances robotic arm control performance, paving the way for applications in diverse and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into
healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to
achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic
trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper
presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),
inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in
such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules
(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three
hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two
information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented
using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module
employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust
spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module
similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a
recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing
feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in
simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and
trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.

TL;DR: BFM-Zero introduces a unified framework for humanoid robot control by embedding motions, goals, and rewards in a shared latent space for versatile task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a scalable, unified system that addresses limitations of current humanoid robot control methods, which are either simulation-specific or task-specialized.

Method: BFM-Zero employs unsupervised reinforcement learning and Forward-Backward models to create a smooth latent representation of humanoid robot behavior. It incorporates reward shaping, domain randomization, and history-dependent learning for real-world transferability.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, including zero-shot and few-shot adaptation methods, overcoming sim-to-real challenges.

Conclusion: BFM-Zero signifies progress toward scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models, setting a precedent for unified, versatile humanoid robot control systems.

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid Active SLAM framework to address slow exploration speeds and suboptimal paths by combining a path-uncertainty optimization model and stagnation detection mechanism, achieving faster and more efficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Active SLAM methods are limited by slow exploration and suboptimal paths, necessitating improved frameworks to balance exploration and efficiency.

Method: Proposed a hybrid framework combining Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning for dual-objective reward and Lightweight Stagnation Detection using lidar anomaly and map update stagnation.

Result: Experiments showed up to 65% reduction in exploration time and 42% reduction in path distance compared to existing methods, with improved map completeness and efficiency in complex environments.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical real-world application with enhanced exploration efficiency and reliable mapping, supported by simulations and physical robot validation.

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraspView is a novel RGB-only robotic grasping pipeline that improves accuracy in cluttered environments, overcoming limitations of RGB-D sensors with innovative scene reconstruction and grasping strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robotic grasping caused by occlusion, poor perception, and the limitations of RGB-D sensors, particularly when handling transparent or glossy objects in cluttered settings.

Method: GraspView incorporates three main modules: global perception scene reconstruction, active perception for selecting views to reveal occlusions, and metric alignment for consistent 3D geometry calibration against robot kinematics.

Result: Experimental tests with diverse objects show GraspView outperforms RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, excelling in challenging scenarios like occluded objects and sensing at close range.

Conclusion: GraspView establishes itself as an effective and versatile alternative to RGB-D pipelines for handling real-world grasping challenges efficiently in complex environments.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing sim-to-real transfer in reinforcement learning by conditioning policies on estimated dynamics parameters, improving their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of policy transfer in robotics, where discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics hinder generalization.

Method: A context estimation module is integrated into a domain randomization-based reinforcement learning framework, and various supervision strategies are compared systematically.

Result: Context-aware policies outperform context-agnostic ones in simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks, although supervision strategy effectiveness varies across tasks.

Conclusion: Adopting context-aware policies improves sim-to-real transfer in RL, highlighting the importance of dynamics parameter estimation but dependent on task-specific supervision strategies.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

*Jinfeng Liang,Haocheng Guo,Ximin Lyu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reconfigurable wings design and optimized mechanisms to improve the stability and efficiency of tailsitter VTOL UAVs under wind disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tailsitter UAVs face challenges in multi-rotor mode due to wind disturbances caused by exposed frontal fuselage areas.

Method: The authors developed reconfigurable wings, a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration, and optimized swashplateless mechanisms for pitch and roll control.

Result: The design reduces power consumption, vibration, and structural complexity, leading to improved flight performance.

Conclusion: The proposed design enhances tailsitter UAV efficiency and stability, validated through transition flight tests.

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of achieving compact yet expressive spatial understanding under partial observability for efficient autonomous navigation in unknown settings.

Method: MacroNav combines a multi-task self-supervised learning-based context encoder with a reinforcement learning policy that uses graph-based reasoning for navigation decision-making.

Result: MacroNav significantly improves navigation efficiency and robustness, showcasing superior performance in Success Rate and SPL metrics during real-world deployments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that MacroNav successfully balances rich spatial representation and navigation efficiency, providing a promising solution for autonomous navigation in real-world environments.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level
decision making. Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual
representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a
learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a
lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation
methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL),
while maintaining low computational cost. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraSP-VLA combines neuro-symbolic planning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models using Continuous Scene Graph representation to enhance autonomous robots' ability to learn from demonstrations and perform long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for robots learning through demonstrations struggle with limitations: VLA models lack high-level symbolic planning for complex tasks, while symbolic approaches in AML have issues with generalization and scalability.

Method: GraSP-VLA introduces Continuous Scene Graphs to transform human demonstrations into symbolic representations for automated planning domain generation. It integrates these symbolic representations with low-level VLA policies for long-horizon task execution.

Result: The framework successfully models symbolic representations and generates robust automated planning domains from observations. Real-world experiments validate the ability of GraSP-VLA to orchestrate VLA policies effectively in complex tasks.

Conclusion: GraSP-VLA significantly improves the scalability and efficiency of autonomous robots in performing complex, long-horizon tasks by integrating neuro-symbolic representation and planning tools.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

### [246] [Studying the Effect of Explicit Interaction Representations on Learning Scene-level Distributions of Human Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04375)
*Anna Mészáros,Javier Alonso-Mora,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates methods for representing interactions between agents to predict scene evolution for autonomous vehicles, showing that explicitly modeled interactions outperform implicit learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal way to represent agent interactions for precise scene prediction and autonomous vehicle decision-making.

Method: Study and compare various approaches to representing agent interactions in a unified network structure, focusing on explicit modeling versus implicit learning through data.

Result: Explicitly defined interactions, such as temporal precedence at intersections, generally outperform implicit connections established by neural networks.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeled agent interactions enhance the performance of joint distribution predictions, benefiting autonomous vehicle decision processes.

Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is
relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing
more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles.
While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it
remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from
the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear
consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they
should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly
modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in
human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing
interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final
learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply
allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on
data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined
interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an
intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.

*Dexin wang,Faliang Chang,Chunsheng Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ForeRobo, a generative robotic agent combining generative simulations and classical control to autonomously learn manipulation skills. It achieves high accuracy and generalization across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of using simulations effectively to acquire advanced robotic manipulation skills.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes a self-guided propose-generate-learn-actuate cycle integrating generative simulations (ForeGen) and models (ForeFormer) with classical control algorithms.

Result: ForeFormer improves state generation models by an average of 56.32%, and ForeRobo demonstrates effective zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with a success rate of 79.28% across over 20 robotic tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of generative paradigms with classical control offers superior interpretability, execution efficiency, and generalization for real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
79.28\%.

### [248] [Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421)
*Yueyang Weng,Xiaopeng Zhang,Yongjin Mu,Yingcong Zhu,Yanjie Li,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Temporal Action Selector (TAS) algorithm to address the issues in action chunking for learning from demonstration, improving reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action chunking improves expert-policy modeling but struggles with reactivity and adaptation due to reduced decision frequency.

Method: The TAS algorithm dynamically selects optimal actions from cached predictions using a lightweight selector network, optimizing reactivity, consistency, and coherence.

Result: TAS significantly increased task success rates by up to 73.3% and improved training efficiency when integrated with residual reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: TAS is effective in enhancing task performance in simulations and real-world robots, balancing critical dimensions of reactivity, consistency, and coherence.

Abstract: Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration
(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,
action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert
policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of
recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the
inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.
Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off
reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),
which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically
selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves
balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision
consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with
diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -
yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a
base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances
training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both
simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.

*Tao Lin,Yilei Zhong,Yuxin Du,Jingjing Zhang,Jiting Liu,Yinxinyu Chen,Encheng Gu,Ziyan Liu,Hongyi Cai,Yanwen Zou,Lixing Zou,Zhaoye Zhou,Gen Li,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Evo-1 is a lightweight Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model designed to improve computational efficiency, deployment, and performance without robot data pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, such as excessive computational needs, dependence on large-scale robot data pretraining, and limited deployability for real-time use.

Method: Evo-1 employs a native multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM) with innovative architecture components like a cross-modulated diffusion transformer and optimized integration module. It introduces a two-stage training paradigm to better align action with perception while preserving backbone representations.

Result: Evo-1 has 0.77 billion parameters and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks, surpassing previous models by significant margins. It performs well on real-world evaluations with a high success rate, efficient inference, and low memory overhead.

Conclusion: Evo-1 sets new benchmarks for lightweight and efficient VLA models, offering significant improvements over existing methods in performance and deployability without pretraining on robot data. Code, data, and model weights are provided for further research.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

*Phat Nguyen,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Guy Rosman,Andrew Silva,Sertac Karaman,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a shared autonomy framework that combines human input and autonomous planners using Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enhance decision-making in challenging driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems struggle in rare, ambiguous, and out-of-distribution scenarios, whereas human drivers excel by employing contextual reasoning. The study aims to address this gap using shared autonomy to seamlessly integrate human input.

Method: The framework uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driving intent from multi-modal inputs such as driver actions and environmental context, enabling the synthesis of effective strategies that combine human and autonomous control.

Result: In tests, the framework demonstrated perfect recall with high precision and accuracy in mock experiments. A human subject survey showed 92% agreement with the arbitration system, and the framework reduced collision rates and improved performance in the Bench2Drive benchmark.

Conclusion: High-level semantic, language-based arbitration appears effective for shared autonomy, ensuring systems align closely with human intent and incorporate common-sense reasoning for improved autonomous driving performance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

*Kaifeng Zhang,Shuo Sha,Hanxiao Jiang,Matthew Loper,Hyunjong Song,Guangyan Cai,Zhuo Xu,Xiaochen Hu,Changxi Zheng,Yunzhu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a real-to-sim framework for evaluating robotic manipulation of deformable objects using simulation, leveraging a realistic rendering method called 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating robotic manipulation policies with deformable objects in the real world is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to reproduce, necessitating a scalable and accurate simulation alternative.

Method: The authors developed a framework that builds digital twins of soft bodies from real-world videos and simulates robots and environments with photorealistic accuracy using 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: This framework was tested on tasks like toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing, showing strong correlation between simulated and real-world results and enabling the discovery of policy behaviors.

Conclusion: Physics-based reconstruction combined with realistic rendering enables scalable and reproducible evaluation of robotic manipulation policies, making simulation an effective alternative to direct real-world testing.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

### [252] [X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671)
*Maximus A. Pace,Prithwish Dan,Chuanruo Ning,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Audrey Du,Edward W. Duan,Wei-Chiu Ma,Kushal Kedia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces "X-Diffusion," a method to leverage human video data for robot learning, addressing execution mismatches between humans and robots using noise-based diffusion processes for effective policy training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human video data is abundant and scalable for training robots, but human and robot action discrepancies hinder direct transfer of motion data. A solution is needed to harness the value of human demonstrations despite physical differences.

Method: The paper proposes X-Diffusion, which applies a diffusion process to human actions. Noise is added to human motion data until execution differences are minimized. Noisy human actions provide high-level guidance, while robot-executable actions refine policies at low noise levels.

Result: X-Diffusion outperforms other co-training methods, improving average success rates by 16% across five manipulation tasks, and effectively addresses execution mismatches between humans and robots.

Conclusion: The X-Diffusion framework demonstrates the potential of leveraging human video data for robot learning by addressing embodiment discrepancies, providing a scalable and effective solution for manipulating tasks.

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website
is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

*Qingzhou Lu,Yao Feng,Baiyu Shi,Michael Piseno,Zhenan Bao,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents GentleHumanoid, a framework for incorporating impedance control in humanoid robots to enhance safety and natural physical interaction in tasks involving compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable humanoid robots to operate effectively and safely in human-centered environments, addressing limitations in current reinforcement learning policies that are rigid and suppress external forces.

Method: The method involves integrating impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking policy using a spring-based formulation to manage both resistive and guiding contact forces.

Result: GentleHumanoid demonstrated smoother, more natural interactions, reducing peak contact forces across various tasks in both simulation and real robot evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework advances humanoid robotics by improving compliance and interaction safety, emphasizing its potential for real-world collaborative tasks and object manipulation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for statistical causal inference (SCI) in software engineering research to assess the impact of interventions when randomized control trials are not feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure that the tools, processes, and guidelines developed by software engineering research successfully contribute to better software development and user outcomes, requiring causal evidence for their effectiveness.

Method: The paper emphasizes statistical causal inference (SCI) as a reliable approach to assess causal relationships between interventions and outcomes in cases where controlled experiments are unfeasible.

Result: The discussion highlights the limitations of randomized trials in software engineering and advocates the use of SCI to address these limitations effectively.

Conclusion: Reliably implementing SCI can help provide evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in software engineering, which is imperative for improving practices and outcomes in the field.

Abstract: As any scientific discipline, the software engineering (SE) research
community strives to contribute to the betterment of the target population of
our research: software producers and consumers. We will only achieve this
betterment if we manage to transfer the knowledge acquired during research into
practice. This transferal of knowledge may come in the form of tools,
processes, and guidelines for software developers. However, the value of these
contributions hinges on the assumption that applying them causes an improvement
of the development process, user experience, or other performance metrics. Such
a promise requires evidence of causal relationships between an exposure or
intervention (i.e., the contributed tool, process or guideline) and an outcome
(i.e., performance metrics). A straight-forward approach to obtaining this
evidence is via controlled experiments in which a sample of a population is
randomly divided into a group exposed to the new tool, process, or guideline,
and a control group. However, such randomized control trials may not be
legally, ethically, or logistically feasible. In these cases, we need a
reliable process for statistical causal inference (SCI) from observational
data.

*Nikta Akbarpour,Mahdieh Sadat Benis,Fatemeh Hendijani Fard,Ali Ouni,Mohamed Aymen Saied*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAMP, a lightweight framework for automated program repair in Ruby, using collaborative agents and test-driven feedback to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ruby has been overlooked in Automated Program Repair research despite its widespread use and the challenges developers face in debugging.

Method: RAMP employs collaborative agents to iteratively generate tests, identify errors, and refine fixes, avoiding reliance on large repair databases or costly model fine-tuning.

Result: RAMP achieves a pass@1 of 67% on the XCodeEval benchmark for Ruby, converging quickly within five iterations and excelling in repairing various types of errors.

Conclusion: RAMP establishes a promising framework for enhancing debugging tools in under-studied languages by leveraging lightweight, feedback-driven methods with collaborative agents.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language
Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and
focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web
development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received
little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel
lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,
iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that
generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a
correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid
reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead
operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven
feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a
pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly
within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and
self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that
RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,
and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair
strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging
tools to under-studied languages.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of English language proficiency in prompts on the quality of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether the natural language proficiency of prompts, independent of their structure, affects the code quality generated by LLMs, considering the widespread use of Foundation Models in software engineering.

Method: The study systematically varied English proficiency levels in prompts (from basic to advanced) across 164 programming tasks using the HumanEval dataset and measured code proficiency and correctness.

Result: The findings show that LLMs generally generate intermediate-level (B2) natural language prompts, and higher language proficiency prompts lead to more correct code consistently across all models.

Conclusion: Natural language proficiency plays an essential role in influencing code generation by LLMs. Developers can leverage this to improve AI-generated solutions' reliability and quality.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Foundation Model (FM)-powered tools in
software engineering, the natural language prompt has become a critical
interface between developers and Large Language Models (LLMs). While much
research has focused on prompt structure, the natural language proficiency is
an underexplored factor that can influence the quality of generated code. This
paper investigates whether the English language proficiency itself independent
of the prompting technique affects the proficiency and correctness of code
generated by LLMs. Using the HumanEval dataset, we systematically varied the
English proficiency of prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks
and measured the resulting code proficiency and correctness. Our findings show
that LLMs default to an intermediate (B2) natural language level. While the
effect on the resulting code proficiency was model-dependent, we found that
higher-proficiency prompts consistently yielded more correct code across all
models. These results demonstrate that natural language proficiency is a key
lever for controlling code generation, helping developers tailor AI output and
improve the reliability of solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexity of generating RTL code autonomously and efficiently using collaborative agent systems.

Method: The method involves using multiple agents with specialized LLMs and hardware simulation tools, along with a progressive error feedback system for self-correction.

Result: The system shows superior pass rates, validated using two open-source datasets and efficient token usage, setting new benchmarks in RTL generation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the performance gap across different LLMs and achieves state-of-the-art RTL code generation autonomously.

Abstract: We present an agentic flow consisting of multiple agents that combine
specialized LLMs and hardware simulation tools to collaboratively complete the
complex task of Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation without human
intervention. A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error
feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages
iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the
approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional
correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach
to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural
language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach
implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and
closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them.
Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark,
providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing design-to-code methods lack consistency, precision, and production-ready quality.

Method: Introduces ParseAlignGenerate pipeline using PSD file parsing to enhance frontend code generation via multimodal large language models.

Result: Evaluation shows improved code similarity, fidelity, and readiness over previous methods, with robust model independence.

Conclusion: The integration of structured design data with multimodal models paves the way for advancing automated frontend code generation.

Abstract: Design-to-code generation has emerged as a promising approach to bridge the
gap between design prototypes and deployable frontend code. However, existing
methods often suffer from structural inconsistencies, asset misalignment, and
limited production readiness. This paper presents PSD2Code, a novel multi-modal
approach that leverages PSD file parsing and asset alignment to generate
production-ready React+SCSS code. Our method introduces a ParseAlignGenerate
pipeline that extracts hierarchical structures, layer properties, and metadata
from PSD files, providing large language models with precise spatial
relationships and semantic groupings for frontend code generation. The system
employs a constraint-based alignment strategy that ensures consistency between
generated elements and design resources, while a structured prompt construction
enhances controllability and code quality. Comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods across multiple
metrics including code similarity, visual fidelity, and production readiness.
The method exhibits strong model independence across different large language
models, validating the effectiveness of integrating structured design
information with multimodal large language models for industrial-grade code
generation, marking an important step toward design-driven automated frontend
development.

*Hao Zhu,Jia Li,Cuiyun Gao,Jiaru Qian,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Lecheng Wang,Ziliang Wang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces VulInstruct, a method to enhance LLMs in detecting software vulnerabilities by equipping them with security specifications derived from historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs perform well in code understanding, their ability to detect vulnerabilities is limited due to a lack of knowledge regarding security specifications which define expected safe behaviors.

Method: VulInstruct constructs a specification knowledge base by extracting security knowledge from historical vulnerabilities, including general and domain-specific specifications, and makes LLMs consider this information during detection.

Result: In evaluations, VulInstruct achieved significant improvements in F1-score (45.0%, +32.7%), recall (37.7%, +50.8%), and uniquely identified 24.3% of vulnerabilities, which is 2.4 times better than baselines.

Conclusion: By systematically incorporating specification knowledge, VulInstruct improves LLMs' ability to detect vulnerabilities and demonstrated its practical utility by discovering an unknown high-severity vulnerability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
understanding tasks. However, they demonstrate limited performance in
vulnerability detection and struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from
patched code. We argue that LLMs lack understanding of security specifications
-- the expectations about how code should behave to remain safe. When code
behavior differs from these expectations, it becomes a potential vulnerability.
However, such knowledge is rarely explicit in training data, leaving models
unable to reason about security flaws. We propose VulInstruct, a
specification-guided approach that systematically extracts security
specifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones. VulInstruct
constructs a specification knowledge base from two perspectives: (i) General
specifications from high-quality patches across projects, capturing fundamental
safe behaviors; and (ii) Domain-specific specifications from repeated
violations in particular repositories relevant to the target code. VulInstruct
retrieves relevant past cases and specifications, enabling LLMs to reason about
expected safe behaviors rather than relying on surface patterns. We evaluate
VulInstruct under strict criteria requiring both correct predictions and valid
reasoning. On PrimeVul, VulInstruct achieves 45.0% F1-score (32.7% improvement)
and 37.7% recall (50.8% improvement) compared to baselines, while uniquely
detecting 24.3% of vulnerabilities -- 2.4x more than any baseline. In pair-wise
evaluation, VulInstruct achieves 32.3% relative improvement. VulInstruct also
discovered a previously unknown high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-56538) in
production code, demonstrating practical value for real-world vulnerability
discovery. All code and supplementary materials are available at

### [260] [LLM-Driven Adaptive Source-Sink Identification and False Positive Mitigation for Static Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04023)
*Shiyin Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AdaTaint integrates LLM-driven taint analysis with symbolic validation to reduce false positives and improve recall in software vulnerability detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of excessive false positives and incomplete source-sink specifications in static software vulnerability analysis.

Method: A neuro-symbolic framework that combines LLM inference with constraint validation for adaptable and deterministic vulnerability analysis.

Result: AdaTaint achieved 43.7% false positive reduction and an 11.2% improvement in recall on various benchmarks compared to top existing approaches.

Conclusion: LLM inference combined with symbolic validation improves accuracy and reliability of static vulnerability analysis, offering a practical solution for real-world software projects.

Abstract: Static analysis is effective for discovering software vulnerabilities but
notoriously suffers from incomplete source--sink specifications and excessive
false positives (FPs). We present \textsc{AdaTaint}, an LLM-driven taint
analysis framework that adaptively infers source/sink specifications and
filters spurious alerts through neuro-symbolic reasoning. Unlike LLM-only
detectors, \textsc{AdaTaint} grounds model suggestions in program facts and
constraint validation, ensuring both adaptability and determinism.
  We evaluate \textsc{AdaTaint} on Juliet 1.3, SV-COMP-style C benchmarks, and
three large real-world projects. Results show that \textsc{AdaTaint} reduces
false positives by \textbf{43.7\%} on average and improves recall by
\textbf{11.2\%} compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CodeQL, Joern, and
LLM-only pipelines), while maintaining competitive runtime overhead. These
findings demonstrate that combining LLM inference with symbolic validation
offers a practical path toward more accurate and reliable static vulnerability
analysis.

### [261] [Benchmarking and Studying the LLM-based Agent System in End-to-End Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04064)
*Zhengran Zeng,Yixin Li,Rui Xie,Wei Ye,Shikun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a challenging benchmark (E2EDevBench) to test LLM-based autonomous agents for software development and introduces a hybrid evaluation framework to better measure their capabilities. Results show agents meet ~50% of requirements, with task decomposition being crucial, but face challenges in requirement omission and self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limitations of evaluating LLM-based autonomous agents, specifically the use of simplistic benchmarks and challenges in comparing agents fairly, to enhance their effectiveness in end-to-end software development.

Method: The authors developed a dynamic benchmark (E2EDevBench) to mimic realistic development scenarios and introduced a hybrid evaluation framework combining test-case-based assessments and LLM-based requirement verification. They conducted a controlled study on three agent architectures designed on a unified foundation to isolate workflow design impacts.

Result: Findings show that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill approximately 50% of requirements, but their performance highly depends on architectural strategies for task decomposition and collaboration. They are hindered by omitted requirements and insufficient self-verification.

Conclusion: The paper provides a realistic benchmark and robust evaluation framework, offering insights into current challenges and capabilities of software agents while emphasizing the need for improving comprehension of requirements and planning systems.

Abstract: The development of LLM-based autonomous agents for end-to-end software
development represents a significant paradigm shift in software engineering.
However, the scientific evaluation of these systems is hampered by significant
challenges, including overly simplistic benchmarks and the difficulty of
conducting fair comparisons between different agent architectures due to
confounding implementation variables. To address these limitations, we first
construct a challenging and dynamically curated E2EDevBench to simulate
realistic development scenarios. Second, we propose a hybrid evaluation
framework that combines test-case-based functional assessment with
fine-grained, LLM-based requirement verification. Using this framework, we
conduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent
architectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of
workflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill
approximately 50\% of requirements on \bench{}, but their success is critically
dependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and
collaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck
is the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification. This work
provides the community with a more realistic benchmark, a comprehensive
evaluation framework, and crucial insights into the current capabilities and
core challenges of software development agents, guiding future research toward
enhancing requirement comprehension and planning.

### [262] [Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04157)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines how closely Large Language Models (LLMs) align with human judgments on responsible AI values, showing they often align more with AI practitioners than the general US public, yet inconsistencies exist in their stated and applied behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLMs in software engineering tasks necessitates understanding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values to ensure trustworthy AI development.

Method: 23 LLMs were evaluated through four tasks: selecting responsible AI values, rating importance in context, resolving value trade-offs, and prioritizing requirements embodying those values.

Result: LLMs align more closely with AI practitioners than the US-representative sample, emphasizing values like fairness and accountability. However, gaps were observed between their claimed values and actual prioritization behavior.

Conclusion: Reliance on LLMs in requirements engineering presents risks without human oversight, highlighting the need for benchmarks and monitoring systems to ensure value alignment in AI-assisted software development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software
engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation,
raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on
responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value
preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample
and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key
responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3)
resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software
requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally
align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative
sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and
accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs
claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),
revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These
findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements
engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic
approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted
software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAFE, an IDE plugin utilizing GPT-4o to enhance explanations of vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools, improving usability and aiding developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAST tools have usability challenges due to generic warning messages that hinder developers from understanding vulnerabilities, prompting the need for better communication methods.

Method: The authors propose SAFE, a hybrid approach leveraging GPT-4o within an IDE plugin to explain vulnerability causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies detected by SAST tools.

Result: The study shows that SAFE’s LLM-generated explanations help beginner and intermediate developers address security vulnerabilities effectively.

Conclusion: SAFE significantly enhances the usability of SAST tools by improving developer understanding of vulnerabilities, which supports better resolution and security maintenance.

Abstract: The prevalence of security vulnerabilities has prompted companies to adopt
static application security testing (SAST) tools for vulnerability detection.
Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their
generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information
to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical
findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach
that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we
present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages
GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of
vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate
that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to
intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security
vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.

*Christos Tranoris*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a lightweight, Git-based communication method for asynchronous information exchange among distributed entities, ensuring transparency and autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace traditional APIs and message brokers by extending Git's capabilities for efficient, transparent, and traceable inter-entity communication.

Method: A Git-based communication model inspired by Kubernetes Operators and Custom Resources (CRs) where entities interact through a shared repository.

Result: The approach extends GitOps principles to allow inter-domain collaboration and ensures traceability, transparency, and autonomy for distributed systems.

Conclusion: Git's native features enable secure, auditable, and efficient asynchronous communication, but with trade-offs compared to traditional integration methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and auditable method for asynchronous
information exchange between distributed entities using Git as the coordination
medium. The proposed approach replaces traditional APIs and message brokers
with a Git-based communication model built on the principles of Kubernetes
Operators and Custom Resources (CRs). Each participating entity, designated as
a Publisher or Consumer, interacts through a shared repository that serves as a
single source of truth, where the spec field captures the desired state and the
status field reflects the observed outcome. This pattern extends GitOps beyond
infrastructure management to support cross-domain, inter-organizational, and
air-gapped collaboration scenarios. By leveraging Git native features
(versioning, commit signing, and access control) the model ensures
transparency, traceability, and reproducibility while preserving loose coupling
and autonomy between systems. The paper discusses architectural principles,
implementation considerations, and comparisons with RESTful and broker-based
integrations, highlighting both the advantages and trade-offs of adopting Git
as a declarative communication substrate.

*Jiahui Wu,Chengjie Lu,Aitor Arrieta,Shaukat Ali*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DriveRLR, a tool to test the ability of LLMs to evaluate the realism of simulated driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the challenge of evaluating the realism of scenarios in autonomous driving systems, where simulation-based testing is key but lacks effective realism assessment methods.

Method: The authors propose DriveRLR, a benchmark that generates scenario variants, builds prompts, and evaluates LLMs on their ability and robustness in assessing scenario realism using the DeepScenario dataset.

Result: DriveRLR successfully identifies differences in LLM robustness and demonstrates its utility in assessing scenario realism through testing on state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2.

Conclusion: DriveRLR is an effective tool for evaluating LLMs' robustness in realism assessment. It can additionally serve as an objective function in generating driving scenarios, enhancing simulation-based ADS testing workflows.

Abstract: In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress,
yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based
testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained
traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However,
evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating
demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through
scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a
benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of
driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs
prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in
determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the
DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4
Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals
differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness
and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness
evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as
an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based
ADS testing workflows.

*Amir Molzam Sharifloo,Maedeh Heydari,Parsa Kazerooni,Daniel Maninger,Mira Mezini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines weaknesses in large language models (LLMs) for code generation and identifies failure patterns through benchmark analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand current limitations of LLMs in code generation by examining tasks they fail to solve.

Method: The authors analyzed four popular benchmarks for code generation, focusing on tasks where LLMs consistently fail, and investigated contributing factors like code complexity and recurring failure patterns.

Result: The study identified four key weaknesses in LLMs for code generation and common complications in benchmark tasks causing failures.

Conclusion: Despite the success of LLMs in code generation, they exhibit recurrent weaknesses and fail on specific tasks, highlighting areas for improvement to build more capable models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central
focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular,
offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight
into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is
crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of
more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks
across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most
likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated
whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by
a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our
analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as
common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of using the LLM agent assistant Cursor on software development velocity and quality, finding short-term productivity increases but long-term challenges in code complexity and warnings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide empirical evidence on whether LLM agents like Cursor actually deliver the claimed productivity boosts in software engineering.

Method: Used a causal estimation with difference-in-differences design to compare GitHub projects adopting Cursor against matched non-adopting projects.

Result: Adopting Cursor significantly increases development velocity transiently, but raises code complexity and static analysis warnings, leading to long-term velocity deterioration.

Conclusion: LLM agents like Cursor improve short-term development productivity but negatively affect long-term software quality and velocity. These results are pivotal for practitioners, developers, and researchers designing LLM-assisted tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize
the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly
gaining momentum in their application to software development, with
practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet,
empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate
the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely
Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled
by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing
Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub
projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a
significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development
velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis
warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments
estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code
complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our
study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent
assistant designers, and researchers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EDIT-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' code editing capabilities based on real-world data, demonstrating challenges and variability in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks and dependence on artificial sources for evaluating code editing capabilities of LLMs with user instructions.

Method: Development of EDIT-Bench, a diverse dataset of 545 problems across multiple languages and real-world use cases that test context-dependent code editing tasks.

Result: Evaluation of 40 LLMs on EDIT-Bench showed it is a challenging benchmark, with only 5 models scoring over 60% and performance varying across user instruction categories and levels of contextual information.

Conclusion: EDIT-Bench provides a robust evaluation framework for code editing capabilities, highlighting the importance of realistic context and motivating improvements in LLMs for handling diverse editing tasks.

Abstract: Instructed code editing, where LLMs directly modify a developer's existing
code based on a user instruction, is becoming a widely used interaction mode in
AI coding assistants. However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability
and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world
usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild.
EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming
languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving
errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems
that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor
position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and
observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models
score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different
categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of
contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance
varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic
context.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the propagation of dependencies in microservices, proposing a method to achieve module independence and introducing a new architecture called EIGHT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of dependency propagation and inter-module coupling in microservices, which hinders module independence.

Method: The paper proposes a conceptual method for calculating module independence and develops universal interfaces as boundaries between modules. This methodology is implemented into a platform architecture called EIGHT.

Result: The EIGHT architecture demonstrates that module independence enables dynamic loading, unloading, or modification of any part of a monolithic application in runtime.

Conclusion: The architecture explores a new approach for complex systems design beyond microservices and monolithic architectures, emphasizing module independence.

Abstract: Although microservices have physically isolated modules, they have failed to
prevent the propagation and diffusion of dependencies. To trace the root cause
of the inter-module coupling, this paper, starting from the impact assessment
approach for module changes, proposes a conceptual method for calculating
module independence and utilizes this method to derive the necessary conditions
for module independence. Then, a new system design philosophy and software
engineering methodology is proposed, aimed at eliminating dependencies between
modules. A specific pattern is employed to design a set of universal
interfaces, serving as a universal boundary between modules. Subsequently, this
method is used to implement a platform architecture named EIGHT, demonstrating
that, as long as module independence is guaranteed, even a monolithic
application within a single process can dynamically load, unload, or modify any
part at runtime. Finally, the paper concludes that this architecture aims to
explore a novel path for increasingly complex systems, beyond microservice and
monolithic architectures.

*Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper argues against reductionist methodologies in explaining consciousness and proposes a dual-level model integrating macro-level psychological and micro-level neural laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the insufficiency of reductionist methods to explain macro phenomena like consciousness and prevent epiphenomenalism.

Method: The paper develops a model where the brain operates under dual laws—a set of hypothetical macro-level psychological laws alongside micro-level neural laws—and includes interactions between these levels.

Result: The proposed model allows acknowledgment of causal effects between macro and micro levels, challenging the notion of intra-level causal closure.

Conclusion: To advance scientific inquiry, rethinking reductionism is necessary. This dual-level approach embraces macro-level phenomena's causal efficacy, providing tools to explore consciousness scientifically.

Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes
that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone.
This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro
phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness
suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and
reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal
closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot
be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new
methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level
phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels.
This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not
determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects
from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach
that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction
between these two sets of laws.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning has made breakthroughs inspired by neuroscience, but limitations exist in biologically implausible error propagation and incremental learning.

Method: The paper reviews brain-inspired implementations and examines learning rules and mechanisms derived from neuroscience for error propagation and synaptic updates.

Result: Current deep learning models exhibit challenges in implementing biologically realistic mechanisms, but neuroscience discoveries suggest potential improvements in error integration and propagation.

Conclusion: Integrating neuroscience-inspired synaptic updates could address current limitations in AI, enhancing error propagation and incremental knowledge accumulation.

Abstract: Inspired by key neuroscience principles, deep learning has driven exponential
breakthroughs in developing functional models of perception and other cognitive
processes. A key to this success has been the implementation of crucial
features found in biological neural networks: neurons as units of information
transfer, non-linear activation functions that enable general function
approximation, and complex architectures vital for attentional processes.
However, standard deep learning models rely on biologically implausible error
propagation algorithms and struggle to accumulate knowledge incrementally.
While, the precise learning rule governing synaptic plasticity in biological
systems remains unknown, recent discoveries in neuroscience could fuel further
progress in AI. Here I examine successful implementations of brain-inspired
principles in deep learning, current limitations, and promising avenues
inspired by recent advances in neuroscience, including error computation,
propagation, and integration via synaptic updates in biological neural
networks.

TL;DR: This paper develops an unsupervised graph transformer autoencoder to explore latent geometries in functional brain graphs, enabling meaningful decoding of brain states and generating synthetic functional graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional brain graphs are often studied using separate graph-theoretic or spectral descriptors, neglecting how these features interrelate. The authors aim to unify these analyses to better understand brain graph geometry.

Method: The paper introduces a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion that uses spectral geometry as an inductive bias, enabling integration of topological and spectral properties.

Result: The approach segregated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli effectively. It also allowed sampling of biologically plausible synthetic dense graphs.

Conclusion: The unified graph representation demonstrates potential for analyzing brain function and generating realistic synthetic functional graphs, enhancing brain connectivity studies.

Abstract: Functional brain graphs are often characterized with separate graph-theoretic
or spectral descriptors, overlooking how these properties covary and partially
overlap across brains and conditions. We anticipate that dense, weighted
functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along
which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here,
we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense
functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent
diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide
learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised,
meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with
performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the
diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible
and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.

*Valentin Mouton,Adrien Mélot*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to design surface topographies for achieving desired frictional behavior, bypassing traditional computational hurdles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of designing frictional interfaces with specific macroscopic behaviors, which is difficult due to non-unique solutions and computationally expensive simulations.

Method: The authors propose a generative modeling framework using VAEs trained on a synthetic dataset of 200 million samples from a parameterized contact mechanics model to infer and generate surface topographies aligned with target friction laws.

Result: The framework enables efficient and simulation-free generation of surface topographies, offering a balance between accuracy, throughput, and solution diversity for the friction design task.

Conclusion: This study showcases the potential of generative modeling in solving inverse design problems related to friction, enabling near-real-time manipulation of frictional behavior through custom surface topographies.

Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.

*Aniket Jivani,Cosmin Safta,Beckett Y. Zhou,Xun Huan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bifidelity surrogate model combining Karhunen-Loève expansion (KLE) and polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) for field-valued quantities, along with an active learning strategy to adaptively select high-fidelity samples, improving prediction accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an accurate and computationally efficient approach for modeling field-valued quantities of interest in the presence of uncertain inputs, addressing limitations of single-fidelity and random-sampling techniques.

Method: The authors combine Karhunen-Loève expansions with polynomial chaos expansions to create a bifidelity surrogate model, incorporating low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulations to balance cost and accuracy. An active learning approach is used to adaptively select high-fidelity samples based on surrogate error estimation from Gaussian process regression.

Result: The method demonstrates consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency through examples including analytical benchmarks, convection-diffusion systems, and complex turbulent flow simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed bifidelity KLE surrogate model, combined with active learning, provides an effective framework for accurate, efficient surrogate construction in uncertainty quantification for field-valued quantities of interest, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for
field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach
combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions
(PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output
fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture
dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF)
simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables
accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further
improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively
selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error,
estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression.
New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement
criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL
framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a
one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion
system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy
simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent
improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to
single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.

TL;DR: This paper proposes optimizing measure transportation paths in dynamic measure transport (DMT) through smoother and more effective alternatives, supported by numerical algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional paths used in dynamic measure transport often yield inefficient outcomes, prompting the need for improved paths to enhance transport smoothness and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose optimization problems for identifying alternate tilted paths and use Gaussian process methods for solving partial differential equations to achieve efficient transport models.

Result: The proposed methods recover smoother and more efficient transport models compared to conventional ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of tilted paths.

Conclusion: The study establishes the link between dynamic measure transport paths and mean-field games, advocating for smoother velocities and presenting numerical algorithms to achieve better transport outcomes.

Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of
measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the
fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing
methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these
connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying
tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms
which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a
numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process
methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the
ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models
compared to those which use an untilted reference path.

*Chiraag Kaushik,Justin Romberg,Vidya Muthukumar*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of random kernel matrices, offering simplified proofs and new results, especially for inner-product kernel matrices and anisotropic Gaussian data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify calculations and tighten approximations for random kernel matrices under various conditions, enhancing understanding and methodology.

Method: The authors use decoupling results for U-statistics, non-commutative Khintchine inequality, and correlation kernel matrix analysis.

Result: New tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices in high-dimensional data, simplified proofs of prior findings, and novel results including tighter bias lower bounds for kernel regression.

Conclusion: The work advances kernel random matrix analysis, providing clearer methods and better approximations applicable in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a
random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function
$k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the
non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds
depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation
kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to
provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on
general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are
polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results
that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing
novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally,
using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower
bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.

### [277] [High-dimensional limit theorems for SGD: Momentum and Adaptive Step-sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03952)
*Aukosh Jagannath,Taj Jones-McCormick,Varnan Sarangian*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the scaling limit of Stochastic Gradient Descent with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes in high-dimensional settings, exploring its efficacy relative to online SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously compare online SGD and its variants to understand their performance differences in high-dimensional problems.

Method: A scaling limit framework is developed for SGD-M and adaptive step-sizes, tested on problems like Spiked Tensor PCA and Single Index Models.

Result: SGD-M mimics online SGD dynamics with certain configurations but amplifies high-dimensional effects when step-sizes are not adjusted appropriately. Adaptive step-size approaches improve convergence and stability in the high-dimensional regime.

Conclusion: Adaptive step-size preconditioners enhance performance in settings where online SGD struggles by stabilizing and improving dynamics.

Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent
with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework
to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show
that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an
appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the
step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify
high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online
SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked
Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD
with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the
high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics
admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of
admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These
examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how
early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where
online SGD fails.

### [278] [Robust inference using density-powered Stein operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03963)
*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the $$-Stein operator for robust statistical inference, derived from $$-divergence, providing methods for goodness-of-fit testing and Bayesian posterior approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust inference methods for unnormalized probability models, especially ones that can handle the influence of outliers effectively.

Method: The paper develops the $$-Stein operator, which uses a density-power weighting approach to reduce outlier influence, and introduces robust score matching and applications like $$-kernelized Stein discrepancy and $$-Stein variational gradient descent.

Result: Empirical tests on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential models demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and statistical efficiency compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: The $$-Stein operator and its applications provide a powerful framework for robust statistical modeling, outperforming traditional baselines in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called
the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from
the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for
unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the
model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the
influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness.
Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that
retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing
constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the
$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and
$\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior
approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential
models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both
robustness and statistical efficiency.

### [279] [Online Conformal Inference with Retrospective Adjustment for Faster Adaptation to Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04275)
*Jungbin Jun,Ilsang Ohn*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces an online conformal inference method that adapts faster to changing data distributions using retrospective adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online conformal prediction methods are slow in adapting to distribution shifts as they update predictions only forward without recalibrating past predictions.

Method: The proposed method retroactively adjusts past predictions using regression techniques with efficient leave-one-out formulas, ensuring alignment with the newest data distributions.

Result: Through numerical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets, the method demonstrates faster recalibration and better statistical efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed online conformal inference method improves prediction accuracy and adapts more effectively to changes in data distributions.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing
distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the
exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in
online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent
approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they
slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a
forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data
point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we
propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective
adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional
shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out
update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive,
thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data
distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic
and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster
coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing
online conformal prediction methods.

*Giovanni Barbarino,Nicolas Gillis,Subhayan Saha*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) to noise and provides conditions for accurate factor identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Min-vol NMF has shown success in fields like hyperspectral imaging and audio source separation, but understanding its robustness to noise remains unsolved.

Method: The paper develops the expanded sufficiently scattered condition, ensuring well-scattered data points in the simplex defined by basis vectors, for noise-resilient factor identification.

Result: Min-vol NMF can accurately identify true factors in noisy scenarios provided the data satisfies the expanded sufficiently scattered condition.

Conclusion: The robustness of min-vol NMF against noise is feasible given adequately scattered data, addressing a key limitation in its application.

Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used
successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical
kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However,
its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper,
we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of
noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered
condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in
the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

### [281] [Simultaneous Optimization of Geodesics and Fréchet Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04301)
*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Søren Hauberg,Steen Markvorsen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the GEORCE-FM algorithm, an efficient method to compute the Fréchet mean on manifolds, which outperforms existing methods in accuracy and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing the Fréchet mean, a central concept in geometric statistics, is challenging due to the optimization involved in minimizing Riemannian distances.

Method: The GEORCE-FM algorithm calculates both Fréchet mean and Riemannian distances in a local chart, with extensions for Finsler manifolds and scalability to large data sets.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of convergence (global and local quadratic) are provided, along with empirical evidence showing superior performance in accuracy and runtime compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GEORCE-FM improves computation of the Fréchet mean, offering a faster, more accurate, and scalable solution while guaranteeing convergence.

Abstract: A central part of geometric statistics is to compute the Fr\'echet mean. This
is a well-known intrinsic mean on a Riemannian manifold that minimizes the sum
of squared Riemannian distances from the mean point to all other data points.
The Fr\'echet mean is simple to define and generalizes the Euclidean mean, but
for most manifolds even minimizing the Riemannian distance involves solving an
optimization problem. Therefore, numerical computations of the Fr\'echet mean
require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We
introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fr\'echet mean
and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster
than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and
introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of
data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and
local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in
expectation to the Fr\'echet mean. We further empirically demonstrate that
GEORCE-FM outperforms existing baseline methods to estimate the Fr\'echet mean
in terms of both accuracy and runtime.

### [282] [Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04403)
*Sara Pérez-Vieites,Sahel Iqbal,Simo Särkkä,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for Bayesian experimental design (BED) in dynamical systems with partial observability where traditional methods fail, utilizing nested particle filters for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian experimental design methods are inapplicable to real-world dynamical systems with partial observability, where noisy/incomplete data challenge efficient inference and computation.

Method: The authors derive new estimators for the expected information gain (EIG) and its gradient, explicitly marginalizing latent states and enabling scalable stochastic optimization in state-space models (SSMs). Nested particle filters are employed for efficient online inference.

Result: Their framework demonstrates successful application in realistic models, e.g., susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and moving source location tasks, effectively handling partial observability and online computation.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology expands the applicability of BED by addressing computational and inference challenges in nonlinear dynamical systems with noisy observations and latent states.

Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for
optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial
real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where
only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are
naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the
link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus
information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) --
intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online
algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially
in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving
new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent
states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our
approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online
inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such
as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task,
show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and
online computation.

### [283] [Riesz Regression As Direct Density Ratio Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04568)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between Riesz regression and direct density-ratio estimation (DRE), showing their equivalence in cases like average treatment effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance understanding and application of Riesz regression by demonstrating its connection and equivalence to DRE methods, expanding its utility in causal machine learning.

Method: The study compares Riesz regression with least-squares importance fitting in DRE, leveraging theoretical equivalences and existing analyses in specific scenarios.

Result: Riesz regression is theoretically equivalent to DRE in key cases, facilitating the application of established methods like loss function selection and regularization from DRE to Riesz regression.

Conclusion: This paper bridges Riesz regression and DRE methodologies, enabling enhanced modeling techniques and enriched understanding in debiased machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine
learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al.,
2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct
density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat-
ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz
regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,
Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz
regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer
estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to
directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including
convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via
Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible
models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz
representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct
density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in
Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).

*Zhuo Zhang,Xiong Xiong,Sen Zhang,Yuan Zhao,Xi Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper compares physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators for parametric PDE solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for solving parametric PDEs are computationally expensive and inefficient for handling multi-query scenarios.

Method: Analyzes two paradigms: PINNs, which integrate physical laws as constraints, and neural operators that learn mapping between infinite-dimensional function spaces for parametric PDEs.

Result: Neural operators can achieve up to 10^5 times faster computational speedups compared to classical PDE solvers while retaining similar accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solving via operator learning, highlights practical guidance, theoretical foundations, and key challenges in this evolving field.

Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on
parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional
numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making
parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning
advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural
operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution
operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two
main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and
excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,
DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between
infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.
Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and
electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups
of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query
scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance
for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,
convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional
parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This
work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers
via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource
for this rapidly evolving field

### [285] [BTTDA: Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04292)
*Arne Van Den Kerchove,Hakim Si-Mohammed,François Cabestaing,Marc M. Van Hulle*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel tensor-based method, Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), for feature extraction in Brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs), demonstrating improved classification accuracy in EEG benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs rely on neural activity data for communication, requiring effective dimensionality reduction and structured regularization to decode complex EEG signals. Traditional tensor methods lack flexibility in capturing EEG data complexity.

Method: The proposed method, BTTDA, extends Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA) with a deflation scheme to extract discriminant block terms iteratively, allowing for flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction in EEG data.

Result: BTTDA outperformed traditional HODA and its variant PARAFACDA in ERP decoding (ROC-AUC = 91.25%) and MI tasks. While MI performance was lower overall, BTTDA demonstrated superior accuracy (64.52%) compared to HODA (61.00%).

Conclusion: BTTDA provides interpretable dimensionality reduction for EEG feature extraction, achieving state-of-the-art performance in ERP decoding and showing promise for broader applications in neuroimaging and BCIs.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain
and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record
neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are
essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including
event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current
tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack
the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study
introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel
tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance
classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality
reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a
novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme
to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature
representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant
PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and
MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.
Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the
traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art
performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and
PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%
> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more
efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.
This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI
and broader neuroimaging applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimized framework for computing topological transforms using GPUs, achieving significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for computing weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF) lack scalability and speed for higher dimensions.

Method: A vectorized framework utilizing tensor operations optimized for GPU architectures across both geometric simplicial complexes and cubical complexes.

Result: The framework achieves up to 180x speed improvement in computing WECT and ECF on various image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient computation of topological transforms and is implemented in the Python package pyECT for practical usage.

Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic
function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications.
However, current methods for computing these functions are neither optimized
for speed nor do they scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we
present a vectorized framework for computing such topological transforms using
tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in
full generality across geometric simplicial complexes (or cubical complexes) of
arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant
speedups (up to $180 \times$) over existing methods when computing the WECT and
ECF across a variety of image datasets. Computation of these transforms is
implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.

TL;DR: This paper develops a deep learning-based simulation framework (SBI) to improve cosmological parameter inference using DES Y3 data, showing enhanced accuracy and reduced parameter degeneracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning approaches hold promise for extracting non-Gaussian information from large-scale cosmological structures, improving constraints for cosmological models.

Method: The authors use forward modeling with over one million mock DES Y3 maps and train deep graph convolutional networks in spherical geometry for feature compression. These features are then used for neural density estimation via normalizing flows in a multi-dimensional parameter space.

Result: Significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints are achieved, with 2-3× better precision in the Ωm-S8 plane and reduced degeneracies, as validated through synthetic tests.

Conclusion: Simulation-based inference driven by deep learning showcases substantial benefits for cosmological analyses and offers strong promise for Stage-IV imaging surveys.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful
techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale
structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)
pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for
a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model
based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one
million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.
Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural
networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn
low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with
target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation
of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter
space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias
parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear
bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference
pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic
contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.
Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter
constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m -
S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and
effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These
results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for
upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.

*Valter Uotila,Väinö Mehtola,Ilmo Salmenperä,Bo Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a pipeline to analyze how quantum machine learning ansatzes behave under varying degrees of symmetry, providing insight into the trade-offs between symmetry and factors like circuit expressibility, gate overhead, and entangling capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical trade-offs of symmetrization, like expressibility and computational overhead, in quantum machine learning, given its promising yet underexplored benefits.

Method: The authors analyze 19 quantum machine learning ansatzes by defining symmetries as subgroup sizes, apply symmetrization, and compute metrics like norm differences, circuit depth/size changes, expressibility, and entangling capability.

Result: The study finds increased symmetry reduces expressibility, often increases entanglement capability, and leads to varying gate overhead depending on the ansatz.

Conclusion: The findings help in selecting optimal ansatze designs for geometric quantum machine learning by balancing symmetry, expressibility, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in
geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning.
While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead,
such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not
well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an
automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine
learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning
task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of
the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not
been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries
defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to
these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of
metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying
amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference
between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts
depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third
class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results
demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that
increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,
increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select
sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for
geometric quantum machine learning applications.

Result: The proposed method performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods in simulated environments, while significantly reducing computation time.

Conclusion: The novel method provides an efficient and user-friendly tool for researchers, enabling direct application to behavioral datasets without requiring expertise in convex optimization.

Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to
some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models
have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and
animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization
problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that
appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed
theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical
results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL
models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then
evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some
benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate
that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while
significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python
package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the
analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex
optimization.

Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule deviations remain a major challenge in the U.S.
construction industry, revealing the limitations of deterministic CPM and
static document-based estimating. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D
digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with
natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision
(CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and
deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case
implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable
gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6%
reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an
on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin
sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable
cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that
integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances
forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated
workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and
auditable construction management.

*Tammy Mackenzie,Sukriti Punj,Natalie Perez,Sreyoshi Bhaduri,Branislav Radeljic*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study investigates how decision makers handle power dynamics in AI governance using fictional personas and institutional frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individuals navigate power structures in AI governance within various organizational contexts.

Method: Personalized questionnaires were used to gather insights, developing fictional personas based on Neo-institutionalist frameworks.

Result: Findings illustrated intersections between personal agency, organizational logics, and institutional infrastructures, proposing dynamics of power and testable hypotheses.

Conclusion: Decision makers and policymakers can leverage insights for effective personal engagement in AI governance and institutional change.

Abstract: This paper examines how decision makers in academia, government, business,
and civil society navigate questions of power in implementations of artificial
intelligence. The study explores how individuals experience and exercise levers
of power, which are presented as social mechanisms that shape institutional
responses to technological change. The study reports on the responses of
personalized questionnaires designed to gather insight on a decision maker's
institutional purview, based on an institutional governance framework developed
from the work of Neo-institutionalists. Findings present the anonymized, real
responses and circumstances of respondents in the form of twelve fictional
personas of high-level decision makers from North America and Europe. These
personas illustrate how personal agency, organizational logics, and
institutional infrastructures may intersect in the governance of AI. The
decision makers' responses to the questionnaires then inform a discussion of
the field-level personal power of decision makers, methods of fostering
institutional stability in times of change, and methods of influencing
institutional change in the field of AI. The final section of the discussion
presents a table of the dynamics of the levers of power in the field of AI for
change makers and five testable hypotheses for institutional and social
movement researchers. In summary, this study provides insight on the means for
policymakers within institutions and their counterparts in civil society to
personally engage with AI governance.

### [293] [Climbing the label tree: Hierarchy-preserving contrastive learning for medical imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03771)
*Alif Elham Khan*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework for self-supervised learning (SSL) in medical imaging, aiming to leverage label taxonomies to improve representation quality and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image labels are structured in taxonomies, but conventional SSL methods disregard this rich hierarchical organization, potentially limiting their performance and interpretability.

Method: The proposed method introduces two objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC) to adjust pair strengths based on shared ancestors, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM) to separate groups across hierarchy levels, applying universally across embedding spaces.

Result: Benchmarks demonstrate improved representation quality and taxonomy alignment over strong SSL baselines, validated by hierarchy-specific metrics like HF1, H-Acc, and parent-distance violation rate, along with standard top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns taxonomy-aligned representations, offering enhanced performance and interpretability in medical image processing.

Abstract: Medical image labels are often organized by taxonomies (e.g., organ - tissue
- subtype), yet standard self-supervised learning (SSL) ignores this structure.
We present a hierarchy-preserving contrastive framework that makes the label
tree a first-class training signal and an evaluation target. Our approach
introduces two plug-in objectives: Hierarchy-Weighted Contrastive (HWC), which
scales positive/negative pair strengths by shared ancestors to promote
within-parent coherence, and Level-Aware Margin (LAM), a prototype margin that
separates ancestor groups across levels. The formulation is geometry-agnostic
and applies to Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings without architectural
changes. Across several benchmarks, including breast histopathology, the
proposed objectives consistently improve representation quality over strong SSL
baselines while better respecting the taxonomy. We evaluate with metrics
tailored to hierarchy faithfulness: HF1 (hierarchical F1), H-Acc
(tree-distance-weighted accuracy), and parent-distance violation rate. We also
report top-1 accuracy for completeness. Ablations show that HWC and LAM are
effective even without curvature, and combining them yields the most
taxonomy-aligned representations. Taken together, these results provide a
simple, general recipe for learning medical image representations that respect
the label tree and advance both performance and interpretability in
hierarchy-rich domains.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes CORE, a precise framework for registering whole-slide images (WSIs) at the nuclei level using a coarse-to-fine strategy for multimodal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise and efficient nuclei-level registration of WSIs across diverse multi-stained tissue slide datasets, addressing artefacts, variability, and generalization challenges.

Method: CORE employs a coarse-to-fine approach, starting with artifact filtering, global alignment through feature extraction and tissue morphology analysis, nuclei centroid detection for fine rigid registration, and non-rigid alignment using Coherent Point Drift.

Result: CORE was evaluated on both public and private WSI datasets, demonstrating superior performance in generalizability, accuracy, and robustness compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The CORE framework effectively enhances nuclei-level correspondence in multimodal WSIs, providing a robust methodology for precise tissue analysis applicable across a variety of datasets and microscopy modalities.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential
for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We
propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level
registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The
coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to
effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global
alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with
a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei
centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a
custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment
at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement
field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from
automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable
registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across
modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI
registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and
robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper proposes Augmented Time Series Causal Models (ATSCM) to analyze multivariate temporal data in energy markets, integrating neural causal discovery for counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current electricity price modeling approaches lack explicit causal interpretation and counterfactual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces ATSCM, which uses interpretable factors, time-varying causal graphs learned through neural causal discovery, and counterfactual reasoning applied to multivariate temporal data.

Result: ATSCM can answer tasks like estimating electricity prices under different renewable energy scenarios using real-world data.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel framework to model complex energy market dynamics through interpretable causal structures and enables meaningful counterfactual analysis.

Abstract: Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns,
generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring
continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model
electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual
reasoning capabilities. We introduce Augmented Time Series Causal Models
(ATSCM) for energy markets, extending counterfactual reasoning frameworks to
multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models
energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand
patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate
neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring
ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables
novel counterfactual queries such as "What would prices be under different
renewable generation scenarios?".

*Guylaine Hoffner,Philippe Djian*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper discusses how protein aggregation caused by polyglutamine expansions in huntingtin leads to toxic effects, exploring two potential stabilization mechanisms: hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the nature of bonds stabilizing protein aggregates in Huntington's disease, as this information is crucial for guiding therapeutic approaches.

Method: The research studies protein aggregation mechanisms primarily through cell culture models of Huntington's disease, focusing on hydrogen bonding and covalent cross-linking.

Result: In cell culture models, aggregates are shown to be largely stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but covalent bonds might also play a role. However, the nature of bonds in patient brains remains unknown.

Conclusion: Understanding the nature of bond stabilization in protein aggregates is essential for developing effective treatment strategies for Huntington's disease.

Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

### [297] [Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03898)
*Arup Datta,Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the security of code generated by large language models (LLMs) and demonstrates that while insecurity is prevalent at zero-shot generation, techniques like reflexion prompting significantly improve security outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to assess and improve the security of code generated by LLMs arises from the fact that functional code may not always be secure, highlighting potential risks in automated coding processes.

Method: The researchers used Instruct Prime to refine LLM prompts and evaluate five instruction-tuned code generation models via a zero-shot baseline and reflexion prompting across three rounds. Security was measured using the Insecure Code Detector and analyzed through Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics across programming languages and CWE families.

Result: Findings indicate insecurity is common during initial code generation (25-33% insecure). Python demonstrates higher security rates, while languages like C and C# perform poorly. Reflexion prompting enhanced security accuracy to 79.43% after three rounds, achieving substantial improvements early on and diminishing benefits with further rounds.

Conclusion: Reflexion prompting significantly reduces insecurity in code generated by LLMs, suggesting iterative prompting techniques improve security outcomes. The methodology provides useful insights, especially for addressing weaknesses in certain programming languages and CWE types.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code,
but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code
generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required
prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs
using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach.
Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are
reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the
programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains
common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a
zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the
hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded
secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C
and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion
prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from
70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round
followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and
NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the
benefits. A replication package is available at

TL;DR: The paper develops a hybrid framework combining statistical modeling and machine learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns on e-commerce platforms, providing actionable insights on temporal cybersecurity risk anticipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing sophistication of cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms threatens consumer trust and operational continuity, necessitating advanced detection and forecasting methods.

Method: The study uses Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, applies statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U Test, ANOVA), seasonal forecasting (Auto ARIMA), and ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) for predictive analysis.

Result: Holiday shopping and high-risk events show spikes in cyberattacks, with PII breaches being severe. CatBoost achieved the highest predictive accuracy among models at 85.29%, with a good ROC AUC of 0.8247.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel framework combining forecasting and machine learning for anticipating cyberattack risks, offering valuable insights for cybersecurity resource allocation and encouraging further study into real-time threat detection.

Abstract: Cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms have grown in sophistication,
threatening consumer trust and operational continuity. This research presents a
hybrid analytical framework that integrates statistical modelling and machine
learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns in the e-commerce
domain. Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study
applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including
a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday
shopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than
non-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in
threat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and
CatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent
attack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday
seasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
exhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the
highest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247).
The framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable
ensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type
classification. Ethical considerations, including responsible use of sensitive
data and bias assessment, were incorporated. Despite class imbalance and
reliance on historical data, the study provides insights for proactive
cybersecurity resource allocation and outlines directions for future real-time
threat detection research.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for reverse-engineering the guardrails of large language models, exposing vulnerabilities in their safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security risks associated with observable decision patterns created by guardrails in large language models.

Method: A Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA) framework is proposed, utilizing reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate and replicate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails.

Result: The method successfully achieved a rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 for guardrail extraction in three commercial systems, with minimal API costs.

Conclusion: Current LLM safety mechanisms are vulnerable to reverse-engineering attacks, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrail design and defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce
ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While
effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new
class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this
work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering
attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement
learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data
augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By
iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and
applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges
toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on
three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3,
and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while
requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical
feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks
for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities
in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust
defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid fuzzing framework combining static and dynamic analysis with LLM-guided mutation and semantic feedback, achieving improved vulnerability discovery in software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing software fuzzing techniques lack semantic awareness, resulting in redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states.

Method: Integration of static analysis for control/data-flow information and LLM-guided input mutation. Semantic feedback prioritizes inputs based on program state changes, exceptions, and output semantics using AFL++ and embedding-based similarity metrics.

Result: Faster identification of bugs, higher semantic diversity, and competitive bug discovery compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers during evaluation on real-world targets.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback expedites and enhances vulnerability discovery, showcasing promising advancements in fuzzing methodologies.

Abstract: Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability
discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness,
leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In
this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and
dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and
semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow
information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to
generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution,
I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback
signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output
semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program
behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++,
combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity
metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets,
including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves
faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number
of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the
potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate
and deepen vulnerability discovery.

Motivation: The growing prevalence and complexity of DDoS attacks demand scalable and transparent detection systems to support real-time response and analysis.

Method: Combining TPOT for automated machine learning pipeline selection with SHAP to provide interpretability of features impacting detection.

Result: The framework identifies critical features like mean backward packet length and minimum forward packet header length, demonstrating improved model accuracy and transparency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances scalability and interpretability, offering an enhanced solution for detecting and understanding DDoS attack patterns in cybersecurity.

Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, it has become critical to develop more efficient and
interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle
with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and
understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for
detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The
proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to
automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the
need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is
incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights
into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By
combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this
approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and
minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks,
offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.

Result: The study highlights TEEs' effectiveness in strengthening cloud security infrastructures, along with identifying deployment challenges and potential weaknesses.

Conclusion: TEEs play a pivotal role in establishing secure cloud computing environments, forming a crucial part of Confidential Computing solutions.

Abstract: The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage
capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the
process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of
safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption
at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to
various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing
has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of
hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's
Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts
within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even
with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we
have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and
ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a
thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies,
performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose.
In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible
weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on
the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security
infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation
for Confidential Computing.

Abstract: We consider numerical resolution of principal-agent (PA) problems in
continuous time. We formulate a generic PA model with continuous and lump

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates the ability of Large Language Models to provide scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex domain-specific questions, using the high-temperature cuprates field as a test case.

Method: Experts created a curated database of 1,726 scientific papers and 67 expert-level questions. Six LLM systems, including two RAG-based models, were tested on these questions. Expert evaluations assessed their answers on criteria like factual comprehensiveness and evidentiary support.

Result: RAG-based systems outperformed closed models in key metrics like providing comprehensive and well-supported answers. However, all models demonstrated limitations that were acknowledged and discussed.

Conclusion: While LLMs, particularly RAG-augmented models, show promise in scientific literature exploration, there remain critical shortcomings. The paper provides a framework for evaluating expert-level performance of LLM reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for
scientific literature exploration. However, their effectiveness in providing
scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within
specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of
high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM
systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an
expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of
the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep
understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based
systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available
closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable
of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these

comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems

### [305] [Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849)
*Phuc Nguyen,Josiah Couch,Rahul Bansal,Alexandra Morgan,Chris Tam,Miao Li,Rima Arnaout,Ramy Arnaout*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper compares two methods of measuring entropy, LCR and VS, showing their differences and complementarities using analytical and experimental approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the measurement of entropy by incorporating information from element similarities and differences, beyond traditional frequency-based methods.

Method: The study analyzes entropy using both Leinster-Cobbold-Reeve (LCR) and Vendi score (VS), applying these methods conceptually, analytically, and experimentally on 53 machine-learning datasets.

Result: LCR and VS produce significantly different results, capturing complementary information, with dependencies on similarity scaling and the introduction of the 'half distance' parameter.

Conclusion: LCR is generally preferred for measuring similarity-rich information unless the system has quantum-mechanical traits or linear combinations of fundamental elements, where VS may be preferable. In certain scenarios, LCR and VS can complement one another.

Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon
entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information
encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,
and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information
encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding
similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was
introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,
and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,
analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show
that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary
information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both
LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of
``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an
upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and
conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is
preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more
fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a
quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks
simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;
nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each
other.

### [306] [Fraud-Proof Revenue Division on Subscription Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04465)
*Abheek Ghosh,Tzeh Yuan Neoh,Nicholas Teh,Giannis Tyrovolas*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper examines subscription-based platforms' revenue-sharing models to prevent manipulation, introducing a fairer method named ScaledUserProp that aligns with manipulation-resistance axioms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address manipulation and fraud issues in subscription-based content platforms, which are challenging to resolve through existing machine learning methods.

Method: The authors formalize three manipulation-resistance axioms, assess current revenue-sharing mechanisms for compliance, and propose a new mechanism called ScaledUserProp. They test this rule through experiments using real and synthetic data.

Result: The analysis uncovers flaws in existing widely-used streaming revenue mechanisms in preventing and detecting fraud. ScaledUserProp aligns with manipulation-resistance axioms and proves to be a fairer choice based on experimental validation.

Conclusion: ScaledUserProp presents a promising solution for addressing manipulation in revenue division on subscription-based platforms, outperforming the conventional rules by meeting resistance axioms.

Abstract: We study a model of subscription-based platforms where users pay a fixed fee
for unlimited access to content, and creators receive a share of the revenue.
Existing approaches to detecting fraud predominantly rely on machine learning
methods, engaging in an ongoing arms race with bad actors. We explore revenue
division mechanisms that inherently disincentivize manipulation. We formalize
three types of manipulation-resistance axioms and examine which existing rules
satisfy these. We show that a mechanism widely used by streaming platforms, not
only fails to prevent fraud, but also makes detecting manipulation
computationally intractable. We also introduce a novel rule, ScaledUserProp,
that satisfies all three manipulation-resistance axioms. Finally, experiments
with both real-world and synthetic streaming data support ScaledUserProp as a
fairer alternative compared to existing rules.

*Natalia Glazman,Jyoti Mangal,Pedro Borges,Sebastien Ourselin,M. Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using latent variable modeling to uncover evolving causal relationships in Alzheimer's disease by inferring a pseudotime trajectory, which outperformed chronological age in diagnosis prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of static graph assumptions in causal discovery models for Alzheimer's disease, which do not reflect dynamic disease progression.

Method: The authors applied a latent variable model to real-world Alzheimer’s disease data to infer pseudotime, a data-driven disease trajectory independent of age, integrating basic background knowledge to improve graph accuracy.

Result: Pseudotime was more effective than chronological age in predicting Alzheimer’s diagnosis (AUC 0.82 vs 0.59), and disease-agnostic knowledge improved graph accuracy. It identified dynamic interactions between new and known disease markers.

Conclusion: This framework successfully enables causal discovery in Alzheimer's disease by overcoming static assumptions, showing practicality and improved understanding of disease dynamics.

Abstract: The application of causal discovery to diseases like Alzheimer's (AD) is
limited by the static graph assumptions of most methods; such models cannot
account for an evolving pathophysiology, modulated by a latent disease
pseudotime. We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world
AD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven
disease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal
relationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC
0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge
substantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals
dynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,
enabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops machine-learning models to predict Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) turbulence heat flux in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, enhancing the efficiency of turbulent transport modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create reduced models for turbulent transport, enabling faster profile predictions, uncertainty quantification, and design optimization in plasma physics applications.

Method: Machine learning techniques, including active learning and sparse-grid training, were utilized to develop predictive models for ETG heat flux based on three plasma parameter inputs.

Result: The developed models showed robust predictive accuracy across different datasets, including generalized models for additional radial locations.

Conclusion: Machine-learning-driven reduced models effectively replicate ETG heat flux predictions, supporting their application in broader plasma turbulence studies.

Abstract: Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for
accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as
uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This
paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature
Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model
predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the
normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of
normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and
the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models
across seven radial locations using regression and an active
machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using
low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their
training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing
simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models
using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$
prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction
uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced
models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat
flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models
demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the
original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students at BRAC University often face challenges due to lack of personalized guidance from mentors, and existing digital tools fail to address their specific needs effectively.

Method: The chatbot integrates a data ingestion pipeline for processing and updating diverse information sources, utilizes a hybrid retrieval approach (BM25 ranking and ChromaDB semantic search), and employs a Large Language Model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) for conversational response generation.

Result: The chatbot demonstrates effective performance with BERTScore of 0.831 and METEOR score of 0.809 for its responses. Its data pipeline shows efficiency by processing updates in 106.82 seconds compared to 368.62 seconds for new data.

Conclusion: The chatbot can assist students in navigating their university life more effectively, providing responsive help for planning, routine setup, and understanding their academic environment better.

Abstract: University students face immense challenges during their undergraduate lives,
often being deprived of personalized on-demand guidance that mentors fail to
provide at scale. Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of
customized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot
that will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main
component is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates
information from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages.
The chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25
lexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language
Model, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text
was found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a
METEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82
seconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will
be able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a
better understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better
routines for their semester in the open-credit university.

*Zefeng Li,Ning Yang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRCSD, a GNN-based CF model addressing suboptimal recommendation caused by noise in user-item interactions. It utilizes order-wise signal decoupling and denoising techniques for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to counteract the negative impact of noise in the user-item interaction matrix on recommendation system performance while preserving collaborative signals.

Method: DRCSD employs collaborative signal decoupling into distinct orders, targeted denoising for each order, and modified aggregation mechanisms to prevent signal interference.

Result: Experimental validation on three real-world datasets demonstrates DRCSD's superior robustness against unstable interactions and significant improvements in recommendation accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: DRCSD enhances the performance and reliability of recommendation systems by applying order-wise denoising and avoiding interference in signals, proving effective against existing models.

Abstract: Although the collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm has achieved remarkable
performance in recommendation systems, it suffers from suboptimal
recommendation performance due to noise in the user-item interaction matrix.
Numerous noise-removal studies have improved recommendation models, but most
existing approaches conduct denoising on a single graph. This may cause
attenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can
interrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative
information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel
GNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD
includes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes
signals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise
denoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the
information aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is
modified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling
operation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that
DRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves
statistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy
metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.

Motivation: Tackling the challenge of modeling user preferences across domains in ordered recommendation systems.

Method: The study uses empirical analysis of different LLMs across three tasks with varied datasets to assess their ability for pairwise reasoning over slates.

Result: Finds correlations between task performance and preference function properties in LLMs, pointing to areas for refinement.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in acting as world models for user preferences in recommender systems, but improvements are necessary.

Abstract: Modeling user preferences across domains remains a key challenge in slate
recommendation (i.e. recommending an ordered sequence of items) research. We
investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models
of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an
empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different
datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and
properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas
for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in
recommender systems.

TL;DR: This paper highlights how Hacker News exposure influences GitHub star growth for AI tools using a reproducible system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the immediate impact of social news platform exposure, particularly through Hacker News, on open-source project growth.

Method: A system built on public APIs that tracks GitHub star growth for repositories launched on Hacker News, supported by machine learning models and non-linear approaches to predict viral growth.

Result: The analysis shows repositories gain substantial GitHub stars post-HN exposure: 121 stars in 24 hours, 189 stars in 48 hours, and 289 stars in a week.

Conclusion: Timing of posts critically influences GitHub stars gained, and the framework offers reusable, extendable insights for developers using social news platforms to launch projects.

Abstract: Social news platforms have become key launch outlets for open-source
projects, especially Hacker News (HN), though quantifying their immediate
impact remains challenging. This paper presents a reproducible demonstration
system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI
and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138
repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects:
repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48
hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning
models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify
key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching
at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag
shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The
demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware,
automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations
through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible
and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both
researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how AI systems marginalize Latin American contexts by reflecting biases from economically advanced regions and proposes a culturally aware dataset to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address existing biases in AI systems that marginalize Latin American contexts due to imbalanced datasets and the dominance of English over regional languages.

Method: The authors created a culturally aware dataset based on Latin American history and socio-political contexts. They evaluated six language models, developed a Cultural Expressiveness metric, and conducted statistical and linguistic analyses.

Result: Some language models could reflect Latin American perspectives, but others showed significant misalignment. Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with the new dataset enhanced its cultural expressiveness by 42.9%.

Conclusion: To ensure equitable AI development, the authors recommend focusing on inclusive datasets representing Latin American history, indigenous knowledge, and languages, and adopting community-centered approaches to reduce biases.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often reflect biases from economically
advanced regions, marginalizing contexts in economically developing regions
like Latin America due to imbalanced datasets. This paper examines AI
representations of diverse Latin American contexts, revealing disparities
between data from economically advanced and developing regions. We highlight
how the dominance of English over Spanish, Portuguese, and indigenous languages
such as Quechua and Nahuatl perpetuates biases, framing Latin American
perspectives through a Western lens. To address this, we introduce a culturally
aware dataset rooted in Latin American history and socio-political contexts,
challenging Eurocentric models. We evaluate six language models on questions
testing cultural context awareness, using a novel Cultural Expressiveness
metric, statistical tests, and linguistic analyses. Our findings show that some
models better capture Latin American perspectives, while others exhibit
significant sentiment misalignment (p < 0.001). Fine-tuning Mistral-7B with our
dataset improves its cultural expressiveness by 42.9%, advancing equitable AI
development. We advocate for equitable AI by prioritizing datasets that reflect
Latin American history, indigenous knowledge, and diverse languages, while
emphasizing community-centered approaches to amplify marginalized voices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the challenges of increasing complexity in multi-agent systems, particularly susceptibility to faults and performance bottlenecks.

Method: Proposes a transaction-based design framework for very complex multi-agent systems (VCMAS) and incorporates transaction scheduling to enhance performance.

Result: The OptiMA framework was developed, successfully executing systems with over 100 agents, and demonstrated more than a 16% improvement in performance through transaction scheduling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully resolves key challenges in VCMAS and contributes practical tools for future research in transaction scheduling.

Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

TL;DR: This paper presents a collaborative multi-agent framework to improve automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education by balancing complexity and cognitive demand. Preliminary evaluations show improved educational content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of automatic question generation (AQG) in mathematics education by addressing challenges in controlling problem complexity and cognitive demands within Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Method: The method involves a collaborative multi-agent framework where multiple agents iteratively refine generated question-answer pairs. This process leverages inference-time computation to achieve better alignment between cognitive demand and problem complexity.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show that the multi-agent framework generates higher-quality questions. The output performs well on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance, importance, clarity, difficulty matching, and answerability.

Conclusion: The collaborative multi-agent framework offers a promising method for producing controlled, high-quality, and pedagogically valuable educational content in automated systems, particularly advancing adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

*Ayaan Bedi,Karoliina Lehtinen*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: Explorability in pushdown automata (PDAs) is studied as a measure of nondeterminism, revealing differences in expressiveness and succinctness compared to history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore and formalize a measure of nondeterminism called explorability in pushdown automata to better understand and classify their expressiveness and operational properties.

Method: The authors define k-explorability in PDAs, analyze its hierarchy in expressiveness, introduce parameterized explorability, and explore these concepts in relation to context-free languages and succinctness gaps.

Result: Explorability induces an infinite hierarchy based on k levels, with exponential explorability capturing context-free languages. It also shows significant succinctness differences, including doubly exponential and non-recursively enumerable gaps.

Conclusion: Explorability provides a meaningful framework to examine nondeterminism in pushdown automata, bridging between history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic systems while offering insights into their operational properties.

Abstract: We study explorability, a measure of nondeterminism in pushdown automata,
which generalises history-determinism. An automaton is k-explorable if, while
reading the input, it suffices to follow k concurrent runs, built step-by-step
based only on the input seen so far, to construct an accepting one, if it
exists. We show that the class of explorable PDAs lies strictly between
history-deterministic and fully nondeterministic PDAs in terms of both
expressiveness and succinctness. In fact increasing explorability induces an
infinite hierarchy: each level k defines a strictly more expressive class than
level k-1, yet the entire class remains less expressive than general
nondeterministic PDAs. We then introduce a parameterized notion of
explorability, where the number of runs may depend on input length, and show
that exponential explorability precisely captures the context-free languages.
Finally, we prove that explorable PDAs can be doubly exponentially more
succinct than history-deterministic ones, and that the succinctness gap between
deterministic and 2-explorable PDAs is not recursively enumerable. These
results position explorability as a robust and operationally meaningful measure
of nondeterminism for pushdown systems.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced downscaling framework using AI models to generate high-resolution temperature projections for northern Europe, aiding in climate adaptation efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create reliable high-resolution temperature projections for northern Europe's diverse climate zones to meet the need for effective climate adaptation.

Method: The authors propose a downscaling framework combining Vision Transformer (ViT), ConvLSTM, and GeoStaNet models, evaluated using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS system across 10 meteorological stations, paired with bias-corrected CMIP6 data.

Result: The ViT model shows strong performance with an RMSE of 1.01°C and R-squared value of 0.92. By 2100, Dfc and Dfb zones are projected to warm 4.8°C and 3.9°C, respectively, with significant expansion in diurnal temperature ranges. The subarctic climate zone reveals notable changes by 2032.

Conclusion: The framework provides precise, high-resolution temperature projections for adaptation planning in northern Europe's high-latitude regions affected by rapid climatic changes.

Abstract: Rapid changes and increasing climatic variability across the widely varied
Koppen-Geiger regions of northern Europe generate significant needs for
adaptation. Regional planning needs high-resolution projected temperatures.
This work presents an integrative downscaling framework that incorporates
Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and
Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware
Network (GeoStaNet) models. The framework is evaluated with a multicriteria
decision system, Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS), for ten strategically chosen
meteorological stations encompassing the temperate oceanic (Cfb), subpolar
oceanic (Cfc), warm-summer continental (Dfb), and subarctic (Dfc) climate
regions. Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2-LM) Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs were bias-corrected during the
1951-2014 period and subsequently validated against earlier observations of
day-to-day temperature metrics and diurnal range statistics. The ViT showed
improved performance (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.01 degrees C; R^2:
0.92), allowing for production of credible downscaled projections. Under the
SSP5-8.5 scenario, the Dfc and Dfb climate zones are projected to warm by 4.8
degrees C and 3.9 degrees C, respectively, by 2100, with expansion in the
diurnal temperature range by more than 1.5 degrees C. The Time of Emergence
signal first appears in subarctic winter seasons (Dfc: approximately 2032),
signifying an urgent need for adaptation measures. The presented framework
offers station-based, high-resolution estimates of uncertainties and extremes,
with direct uses for adaptation policy over high-latitude regions with fast
environmental change.

### [320] [Overview and Performance Evaluation of Supervisory Controller Synthesis with Eclipse ESCET v4.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04370)
*Dennis Hendriks,Michel Reniers,Wan Fokkink,Wytse Oortwijn*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper discusses synthesis-based engineering (SBE) in supervisory control systems and improvements in synthesis performance using the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (ESCET), covering algorithms, benchmarks, and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the design and implementation of supervisory controllers for cyber-physical systems by focusing on automation through synthesis-based engineering, enabling engineers to prioritize defining system requirements.

Method: The paper focuses on CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm, evaluates synthesis performance improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 and v4.0, analyzes benchmark models, and explores multi-level synthesis for enhancing performance.

Result: Benchmark evaluation shows performance improvements in synthesis algorithms from ESCET versions, demonstrating practical advancements in handling requirements, reducing runtime errors, and optimizing complex model synthesis.

Conclusion: While current performance improvements in supervisory controller synthesis are promising, further developments are required, especially for complex models, to bolster the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.

Abstract: Supervisory controllers control cyber-physical systems to ensure their
correct and safe operation. Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to
largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based
engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what'
the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it
(design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering
Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and
tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process,
particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we
first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis
algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the
literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of
runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input
variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe
CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and
academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent
improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024)
that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and
show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly
look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate
its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis
performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize
complex models.

*Marios Impraimakis*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A deep convolutional neural network method was tested for model class selection of physical systems, using response signals without requiring input information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal was to improve model class selection for unlabeled signals in structural systems without relying on input data or full identification.

Method: The method uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network trained on response signals with optional enhancement through a Kalman filter-based fusion algorithm.

Result: The approach successfully classified signals with slight variations due to damping or hysteresis, validated on both linear/nonlinear systems and a 3D building model.

Conclusion: This technique shows promise for structural health monitoring applications by selecting model classes based solely on response signals.

Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep
convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet
effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom
along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional
convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class
of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information,
or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement
is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals
using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data.
Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal
variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both
linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite
element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring
applications.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, DRAMN, for power system stability forecasting. It combines physics-informed analysis with advanced graph convolution-based recurrent gating to model system dynamics and temporal dependencies simultaneously, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stability assessment methods struggle with the complex dynamics of modern power systems due to high penetration of inverter-based resources.

Method: The authors developed DRAMN, utilizing sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to generate time-varying adjacency matrices. Integrating graph convolution within recurrent mechanisms, the model captures dynamic and temporal dependencies in power systems.

Result: DRAMN outperformed benchmarks with average accuracies of 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% across tested scenarios. It reduced feature dimensionality by 82% while maintaining performance and demonstrated generalizability across different stability phenomena.

Conclusion: DRAMN proves effective and interpretable for real-time power system stability forecasting, making it highly suitable for deployment in control centers.

Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources
exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and
generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper
presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines
physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system
stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode
decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from
phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as
modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and
spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal
dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly
within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving
dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE
9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance,
achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively,
surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning
algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal
combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without
performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for
small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across
different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while
providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it
suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.

*Patrik Valábek,Michaela Horváthová,Martin Klaučo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for optimizing a pasteurization unit, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy, economic cost, and energy efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve energy efficiency, reduce economic costs, and enhance control accuracy in complex, nonlinear dynamic systems like pasteurization units.

Method: The method transforms nonlinear system dynamics into a linear representation using Koopman operator theory and deep learning-based models. An EMPC is formulated with interpretable economic costs, and feasibility is ensured using slack variables.

Result: The deep Koopman model improved prediction accuracy by 45%, reduced total economic costs by 32%, and decreased steady-state electrical energy usage by 10.2%, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: Integrating deep Koopman representations with economic optimization offers significant practical advantages for resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep Koopman-based Economic Model Predictive Control
(EMPC) for efficient operation of a laboratory-scale pasteurization unit (PU).
The method uses Koopman operator theory to transform the complex, nonlinear
system dynamics into a linear representation, enabling the application of
convex optimization while representing the complex PU accurately. The deep
Koopman model utilizes neural networks to learn the linear dynamics from
experimental data, achieving a 45% improvement in open-loop prediction accuracy
over conventional N4SID subspace identification. Both analyzed models were
employed in the EMPC formulation that includes interpretable economic costs,
such as energy consumption, material losses due to inadequate pasteurization,
and actuator wear. The feasibility of EMPC is ensured using slack variables.
The deep Koopman EMPC and N4SID EMPC are numerically validated on a nonlinear
model of multivariable PU under external disturbance. The disturbances include
feed pump fail-to-close scenario and the introduction of a cold batch to be
pastuerized. These results demonstrate that the deep Koopmand EMPC achieves a
32% reduction in total economic cost compared to the N4SID baseline. This
improvement is mainly due to the reductions in material losses and energy
consumption. Furthermore, the steady-state operation via Koopman-based EMPC
requires 10.2% less electrical energy. The results highlight the practical
advantages of integrating deep Koopman representations with economic
optimization to achieve resource-efficient control of thermal-intensive plants.

*Patrik Valábek,Marek Wadinger,Michal Kvasnica,Martin Klaučo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes using an LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model to improve prediction and estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear systems with input delays are challenging for prediction and control using traditional linear methods due to their complexity.

Method: It introduces a Koopman operator approximation without predefined dictionaries, enhanced by LSTM layers to capture time-delayed dynamics into a latent space model.

Result: Quantitative comparisons show improved prediction accuracy over extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) and comparable results when true dynamics are known.

Conclusion: The LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is promising for better handling nonlinear systems with delay, offering robust dictionary-free representation.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with input delays pose significant challenges for
prediction, estimation, and control due to their inherent complexity and the
impact of delays on system behavior. Traditional linear control techniques
often fail in these contexts, necessitating innovative approaches. This paper
introduces a novel approach to approximate the Koopman operator using an
LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model, enabling linear representations of nonlinear
systems with time delays. By incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
layers, the proposed framework captures historical dependencies and efficiently
encodes time-delayed system dynamics into a latent space. Unlike traditional
extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) approaches that rely on predefined
dictionaries, the LSTM-enhanced Deep Koopman model is dictionary-free, which
mitigates the problems with the underlying dynamics being known and
incorporated into the dictionary. Quantitative comparisons with extended eDMD
on a simulated system demonstrate highly significant performance gains in
prediction accuracy in cases where the true nonlinear dynamics are unknown and
achieve comparable results to eDMD with known dynamics of a system.

*Giorgio Palma,Andrea Serani,Matteo Diez*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents and validates ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for predicting and quantifying uncertainty in a high-speed catamaran's seakeeping ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide an efficient and uncertainty-aware modelling approach for better seakeeping predictions of vessels operating in challenging wave conditions.

Method: The researchers employed HDMDc to construct reduced-order models for the vessel's dynamics, incorporating strategies like Bayesian HDMDc and Frequentist HDMDc for uncertainty quantification and prediction improvement.

Result: Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc) demonstrated improved prediction accuracy and robust uncertainty estimation compared to other models. FHDMDc-based probability density functions closely aligned with experimental and URANS results.

Conclusion: FHDMDc proved to be a reliable and computationally efficient method for seakeeping prediction, suitable for vessel design and operational planning, while Bayesian HDMDc yielded less beneficial results in this specific test case.

Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions
of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental
measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of
gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge
acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin
tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5
conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test
sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order
model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their
time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling
strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters
considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior
mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which
aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing
seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is
found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic
counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the
application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in
comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density
functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS
results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping
prediction for design and operational support.

*Oskar Lappi,Huw Leggate,Yannick Marandet,Jan Åström,Keijo Heljanko,Dmitriy V. Borodin*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: EIRENE, a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver, lacks domain decomposition, leading to limitations in handling large datasets. A new domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) algorithm is introduced in the code Eiron, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to overcome the limitations of EIRENE, which cannot handle simulations requiring grid data distribution across compute nodes due to the lack of domain decomposition.

Method: The paper introduces a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open-source code, Eiron. Two additional parallel algorithms from EIRENE are also implemented and compared using strong and weak scaling tests.

Result: The DDMC algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms, achieving near-superlinear strong scaling on large grids at Mahti supercomputer. It also demonstrated scalability up to 16,384 cores with 45% weak scaling efficiency in high-collisional cases and 26% in low-collisional cases.

Conclusion: Implementing the DDMC algorithm in EIRENE can improve its performance, enabling it to handle previously infeasible simulations due to memory limitations.

Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the
fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it
impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one
compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte
Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code,
Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in
Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests,
with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases.
On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids
that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also
scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency
of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a
low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this
domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable
simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.

*Yoh-ichi Mototake,Makoto Sasaki*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to quantify uncertainties in estimating coefficient functions within Physics-informed machine learning and confirms unique identification using geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed machine learning has potential for solving inverse problems but estimating physically meaningful solutions poses uncertainty issues.

Method: The proposed framework analyzes uncertainties in coefficient function estimation, using geometric constraints for unique identification.

Result: Using the framework in magnetohydrodynamic models, uncertainties are identified and addressed, demonstrating successful application of geometric constraints.

Conclusion: The approach ensures unique estimation of coefficient functions in reduced models, enhancing the reliability of Physics-informed machine learning applications.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential
equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such
as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that
characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding
and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in
PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as
a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models.
For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small
discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to
the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven
model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically
meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and
analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML.
We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our
framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is
possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate
the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.

TL;DR: SinoFlow, a novel CT-based method using PINNs and sinogram data, improves blood flow velocity estimation compared to traditional image-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methods for direct blood flow velocity estimation from CT movies and improve flow assessment efficiency.

Method: Simulated CT scans were performed on idealized vessel models under varied imaging conditions, comparing SinoFlow to traditional PINN-based methods.

Result: SinoFlow reduced flow estimation errors, maintained accuracy across imaging parameters, and supported pulsed-mode imaging better than traditional methods.

Conclusion: SinoFlow offers a promising, accurate, and robust approach for non-invasive blood flow assessment in CT imaging, influencing future applications of PINNs.

Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a
critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography
(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate
cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow
velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved
framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel
bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with
varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.
We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed
images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by
avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was
robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower
mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow
was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with
shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based
flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood
flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT
images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable
acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to generate high-quality quad meshes for aortic valve modeling using deep neural networks, ensuring consistency and efficiency in processing patient-specific CT images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and consistent geometric modeling of aortic valves is crucial for biomechanical analysis and simulations, but traditional approaches struggle with irregular mesh topology and inconsistencies due to patient variations.

Method: The authors introduce a template-fitting pipeline using structured quad meshes and deep neural networks. They employ a simplified loss function with geometry reconstruction and smoothness regularization terms to preserve mesh quality and consistency.

Result: Their approach produces high-quality meshes with better smoothness and shape quality, requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Structured quad mesh-based modeling simplifies the neural network training process, improves mesh correspondence and quality, and increases the efficiency and effectiveness of aortic valve geometric modeling.

Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is
essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess
valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to
generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across
different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with
irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and
inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline
with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)
meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing
aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a
uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element
correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the
learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function
with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness
regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and
element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and
shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to
the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad
meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh
correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.

TL;DR: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) benefits from a new self-supervised framework, $$NeuFMT, enhancing reconstruction accuracy without requiring training data or exact tissue optics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ill-posed reconstruction in FMT caused by dependence on inaccurate or unknown tissue optical properties.

Method: Introduced a self-supervised framework ($$NeuFMT) combining neural-based scene representation with explicit photon propagation modeling to estimate fluorescence distribution and optical properties simultaneously.

Result: $$NeuFMT demonstrated robust reconstruction across diverse scenarios and showed superior accuracy over conventional and supervised deep learning methods.

Conclusion: This method offers precise reconstruction for complex clinical applications like fluorescence-guided surgeries, bypassing the need for pre-existing data or tissue optics knowledge.

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for
non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction
remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on
inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning
methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a
self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit
neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon
propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence
distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction,
eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or
pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly
recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with
severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth).
Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT
outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse
heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and
accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging
in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.

Motivation: Investigate the capability of LLMs in simulating human behavior and conducting a realistic exploration of social phenomena in citation networks.

Method: Introduction of the CiteAgent framework to simulate citation networks and establish new LLM-based research paradigms: LLM-SE (Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (Laboratory Experiment).

Result: CiteAgent successfully replicates real-world phenomena in citation networks, such as power-law distributions and citational distortion, while presenting valuable insights for idealized social experiments.

Conclusion: LLMs, particularly through the CiteAgent framework, show promising potential in advancing research methodologies and expanding science of science studies in social sciences.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to
encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by
leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM
capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social
attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate
citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents.
CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation
networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and
shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two
LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey
Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms
facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to
validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research
scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social
experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights
for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of
LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a piecewise power-law model for analyzing social diffusion patterns and finds that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern across various data sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the popularity of S-shaped logistic curves, there is a lack of focus on sub-exponential growth in understanding social diffusion dynamics.

Method: The authors created a parameterized piecewise power-law model and applied it to approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked with Wikipedia vocabulary and cross-validated findings with web search trend data in multiple languages.

Result: Approximately 55% of the analyzed items adhered to sub-exponential growth patterns, revealing that diffusion scales are determined by growth rates, and varying alpha parameters reflect niche versus widely shared topics.

Conclusion: Sub-exponential growth is widespread in social diffusion, and the provided model effectively describes and interprets diverse social growth dynamics.

Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been
described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of
sub-exponential growth -a slower than exponential pattern known in
epidemiology- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we
present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with
a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of
approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia
vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English,
Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of the 2,965 selected items reveals that
about 55% (1,625 items) were found to have no abrupt jumps and were well
captured by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i)
the mode of the shape parameter alpha was near 0.5, indicating prevalent
sub-exponential growth; (ii) the ultimate diffusion scale is primarily
determined by the growth rate R, with minor contributions from alpha or the
duration T; and (iii) alpha showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the
topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones.
Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model distinguishing outward contact with
strangers from inward interaction within their community suggests that alpha
can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented
communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common
pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for
consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth
curves.

Conclusion: This research transforms machines from logical 'verifiers' to 'discoverers', contributing to advancements in logic and AI.

Abstract: Currently, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical system for systematically
generating non-trivial and logically valid theorems. Addressing this critical
gap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem
generation theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction
which possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for
the first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard
contradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem
Generation (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core
properties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard
contradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy
(the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause).
Leveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular
standard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement
$H$, a valid theorem $A \vdash \neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are
logically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG
algorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is
developed. This research enables machines to transition from "verifiers" to
"discoverers", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of
logic and artificial intelligence.

### [334] [evomap: A Toolbox for Dynamic Mapping in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04611)
*Maximilian Matthe*

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'evomap,' a Python package that enables dynamic mapping, allowing analysis of evolving relationships over time through adapted mapping methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing statistical tools, which only provide static visualizations of relationships, missing the ability to analyze how relationships evolve over time.

Method: The evomap package implements the dynamic mapping framework (EvoMap) and integrates mapping techniques like MDS, Sammon Mapping, and t-SNE, along with utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and analysis.

Result: The evomap package creates dynamic maps that effectively represent evolving relationships and offers a comprehensive toolkit for handling such analyses.

Conclusion: evomap expands the capabilities of mapping technologies by enabling dynamic visualizations of evolving relationships and provides accessible tools for implementing such techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents evomap, a Python package for dynamic mapping. Mapping
methods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among
objects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical
software supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at
a single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships
evolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework
EvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts
traditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports
multiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling
(MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result
evaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications.
This paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes
the architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application
through an extensive usage example.

*Allie Tran,Luca Rossetto*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper investigates the robustness of CLIP models to non-semantic input changes in multimedia information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how minor query variations impact stability and ranking performance in multimodal co-embedding models like CLIP.

Method: The authors systematically analyzed lexical, syntactic, and semantic query perturbations using TRECVID queries and V3C1 video data across various CLIP models.

Result: Syntactic and semantic perturbations cause significant instability, while trivial surface changes (e.g., punctuation, case) introduce brittleness.

Conclusion: Robustness is a vital evaluation criterion for vision-language models, extending beyond conventional accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of
the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in
recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space.
However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability
towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually
expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in
the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a
systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query
perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a
diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple
CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video
collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations
drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial
surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as
a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark
accuracy.

*Edoardo Marcelli,Sean O'Hagan,Veronika Rockova*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a powerful framework called Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF), extending simulation-based methods with deep neural networks for nonlinear, non-Gaussian models without relying on explicit density evaluation, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective and flexible posterior inference in complex dynamic, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian state-space models, especially when explicit density evaluations are difficult or intractable.

Method: The authors use simulation-based methods enhanced by deep neural networks for recursive posterior inference and propose a Generative-Gibbs sampler for parameter learning via sampling without explicit density evaluations.

Result: The introduced GBF methodology, combined with the Generative-Gibbs sampler, outperformed existing likelihood-free approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness across simulated and empirical studies.

Conclusion: GBF and its associated techniques are a significant advancement for inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with intractable densities, offering improved accuracy and applicability in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF) provides a powerful and flexible
framework for performing posterior inference in complex nonlinear and
non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach extends Generative Bayesian
Computation (GBC) to dynamic settings, enabling recursive posterior inference
using simulation-based methods powered by deep neural networks. GBF does not
require explicit density evaluations, making it particularly effective when
observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable. To
address parameter learning, we introduce the Generative-Gibbs sampler, which
bypasses explicit density evaluation by iteratively sampling each variable from
its implicit full conditional distribution. Such technique is broadly
applicable and enables inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with
intractable densities, including state-space models. We assess the performance
of the proposed methodologies through both simulated and empirical studies,
including the estimation of $\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. Our
findings indicate that GBF significantly outperforms existing likelihood-free
approaches in accuracy and robustness when dealing with intractable state-space
models.

### [337] [Geometric Decomposition of Statistical Inference through Gradient Flow and Co-Monotonicity Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04599)
*Pawel Gajer,Jacques Ravel*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework to study context-specific relationships in high-dimensional data by geometric decomposition on Riemannian graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods often fail to capture context-dependent patterns in complex datasets, limiting the understanding of feature-outcome associations.

Method: The paper proposes two strategies: gradient flow decomposition using discrete Morse theory and co-monotonicity decomposition involving association structures and Riemannian k-NN graphs.

Result: The approach partitions data into subregions for targeted analysis, identifies coherent subpopulations, and enables multi-modal feature integration with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances statistical power and interpretability in exploring diverse and local feature-outcome associations compared to standard global methods.

Abstract: Understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data remains
  challenging when relationships vary across subpopulations, yet standard
  methods assuming global associations miss context-dependent patterns,
reducing
  statistical power and interpretability. We develop a geometric decomposition
  framework offering two strategies for partitioning inference problems into
  regional analyses on data-derived Riemannian graphs. Gradient flow
  decomposition uses path-monotonicity-validated discrete Morse theory to
  partition samples into basins where outcomes exhibit monotonic behavior.
  Co-monotonicity decomposition leverages association structure: vertex-level
  coefficients measuring directional concordance between outcome and features,
  or between feature pairs, define embeddings of samples into association
space.
  These embeddings induce Riemannian k-NN graphs on which biclustering
  identifies co-monotonicity cells (coherent regions) and feature modules. This
  extends naturally to multi-modal integration across multiple feature sets.
  Both strategies apply independently or jointly, with Bayesian posterior
  sampling providing credible intervals.

*Steffen Dereich,Arnulf Jentzen,Sebastian Kassing*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper uses an ODE-based approach to analyze the behavior and convergence properties of the Adam optimizer, revealing conditions under which it successfully finds global minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand and analyze the behavior and convergence properties of the widely-used Adam optimizer in deep learning.

Method: An ODE-based approach with fast-slow scaling analysis, connecting the dynamics of Adam to vector fields and leveraging properties of asymptotic pseudo-trajectories.

Result: The study highlights that the Adam algorithm converges to zeros of the Adam vector field rather than critical points or local minimizers in general settings, but successfully finds global minima in overparametrized scenarios.

Conclusion: This work provides deeper insights into the theoretical convergence behavior of the Adam optimizer and elucidates scenarios where it reliably finds global minima, aiding its applicability in deep learning.

Abstract: The Adam optimizer is currently presumably the most popular optimization
method in deep learning. In this article we develop an ODE based method to
study the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum
parameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an
asymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is
referred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic
pseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.
In particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm
converges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than
a local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.
  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the
Adam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show
that in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a
Lyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a
consequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima
infinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces HACI, an educational tool combining haptic and audio feedback to aid visually impaired students in programming tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance programming education for visually impaired students by addressing challenges associated with the absence of visual cues.

Method: Developed a web application and haptic glove connected via Arduino, tested in a pilot study with Computer Science undergraduates.

Result: HACI improves non-visual programming navigation and comprehension, though challenges remain in refining feedback mechanisms and expanding functionality.

Conclusion: HACI demonstrates the potential of haptic and audio feedback in accessible programming education, paving the way for future advancements in this space.

Abstract: This thesis introduces the Haptic-Audio Code Interface (HACI), an educational
tool designed to enhance programming education for visually impaired (VI)
students by integrating haptic and audio feedback to compensate for the absence
of visual cues. HACI consists of a non-resource-intensive web application
supporting JavaScript program development, execution, and debugging, connected
via a cable to an Arduino-powered glove with six integrated haptic motors to
provide physical feedback to VI programmers. Motivated by the need to provide
equitable educational opportunities in computer science, HACI aims to improve
non-visual code navigation, comprehension, summarizing, editing, and debugging
for students with visual impairments while minimizing cognitive load. This work
details HACI's design principles, technical implementation, and a preliminary
evaluation through a pilot study conducted with undergraduate Computer Science
students. Findings indicate that HACI aids in the non-visual navigation and
understanding of programming constructs, although challenges remain in refining
feedback mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability, as well as
supplementing the current functionality with a more feature-reach and
customizable accessible learning experience which will allow visually impaired
students to fully utilize interleaved haptic and audio feedback. The study
underscores the transformative potential of haptic and audio feedback in
educational practices for the visually impaired, setting a foundation for
future research and development in accessible programming education. This
thesis contributes to the field of accessible technology by demonstrating how
tactile and auditory feedback can be effectively integrated into educational
tools, thereby broadening accessibility in STEM education.

TL;DR: MazeMate integrates an LLM-powered chatbot into a 3D Maze programming game to support computational thinking through adaptive scaffolding. Findings show mixed usability and highlight areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultivating computational thinking is crucial, but current applications of large language models lack focus on developing this skill effectively.

Method: A 3D Maze programming game, MazeMate, embedded with an LLM-powered chatbot, was implemented, allowing evaluation based on classroom use by 247 undergraduate students.

Result: MazeMate was rated moderately helpful for computational thinking, particularly for maze solving rather than maze design. Thematic analysis showed support for decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking but identified limitations in contextual suggestions and algorithm solutions.

Conclusion: The study showcased the potential of LLM-based tools like MazeMate to promote computational thinking while revealing areas where the design needs refinement for better classroom usability.

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a foundational problem-solving skill, and
gamified programming environments are a widely adopted approach to cultivating
it. While large language models (LLMs) provide on-demand programming support,
current applications rarely foster CT development. We present MazeMate, an
LLM-powered chatbot embedded in a 3D Maze programming game, designed to deliver
adaptive, context-sensitive scaffolds aligned with CT processes in maze solving
and maze design. We report on the first classroom implementation with 247
undergraduates. Students rated MazeMate as moderately helpful, with higher
perceived usefulness for maze solving than for maze design. Thematic analysis
confirmed support for CT processes such as decomposition, abstraction, and
algorithmic thinking, while also revealing limitations in supporting maze
design, including mismatched suggestions and fabricated algorithmic solutions.
These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based scaffolding to support CT
and underscore directions for design refinement to enhance MazeMate usability
in authentic classrooms.

### [341] [Efficient On-Device Agents via Adaptive Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03728)
*Sanidhya Vijayvargiya,Rahul Lokesh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: On-device AI agents benefit from a framework that compresses context efficiently, enabling rich interactions while being memory-conscious.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of limited memory in on-device AI agents, allowing for rich and stateful interactions without sacrificing performance.

Method: The framework employs three main optimizations: dynamic memory with LoRA adapters for compressing history, a minimal serialization format for tools, and a just-in-time schema-passing mechanism.

Result: The approach achieves up to a 25-fold reduction in context growth rate and matches or surpasses baseline performance in complex tasks.

Conclusion: Strategic context management is vital for unlocking persistent and capable on-device AI agents.

Abstract: On-device AI agents offer the potential for personalized, low-latency
assistance, but their deployment is fundamentally constrained by limited memory
capacity, which restricts usable context. This reduced practical context window
creates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex
tool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this
trade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by
three synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized
LoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and
structured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool
schemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time
schema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool
selection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to
context-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a
conventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the
performance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context,
achieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a
10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction
verbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking
capable and persistent on-device AI.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) as human-centric support systems and outlines principles, risks, and future directions for their responsible integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs increasingly acting as companions and assistants, there is a need to structure their design for positive user outcomes while addressing their risks.

Method: Authors present a role-based framework, evaluate LLM deployments, and identify critical design principles and novel evaluation metrics.

Result: Cross-domain analysis of LLM deployments highlights standard principles and risks, paving the way for a unified framework and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective and responsible use of LLMs in sensitive domains demands transparent design, proper risk evaluation, and development of hybrid systems to ensure trust and equitable access.

Abstract: Large language models are moving beyond transactional question answering to
act as companions, coaches, mediators, and curators that scaffold human growth,
decision-making, and well-being. This paper proposes a role-based framework for
human-centered LLM support systems, compares real deployments across domains,
and identifies cross-cutting design principles: transparency, personalization,
guardrails, memory with privacy, and a balance of empathy and reliability. It
outlines evaluation metrics that extend beyond accuracy to trust, engagement,
and longitudinal outcomes. It also analyzes risks including over-reliance,
hallucination, bias, privacy exposure, and unequal access, and proposes future
directions spanning unified evaluation, hybrid human-AI models, memory
architectures, cross-domain benchmarking, and governance. The goal is to
support responsible integration of LLMs in sensitive settings where people need
accompaniment and guidance, not only answers.

*Joe Shymanski,Jacob Brue,Sandip Sen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper critiques current XAI evaluation methods, demonstrating that explanations tend to boost user satisfaction regardless of quality, and emphasizes actionable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI evaluation techniques like user surveys and metrics such as fidelity are seen as inadequate and lack generalizability.

Method: Using an agent assistant that teaches chess concepts as an experimental tool, the researchers test their claims and evaluate user responses to explanations.

Result: Findings reveal that virtually any explanation increases user satisfaction, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods beyond simply measuring satisfaction.

Conclusion: The paper calls for more comprehensive and robust XAI evaluation techniques and suggests actionable explanations as a critical area for focus in developing effective models.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to create transparency in
modern AI models by offering explanations of the models to human users. There
are many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of
these XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like
"fidelity". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best
and not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple
user surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those
generated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate
evidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe
any kind of explanation will be "better" in most metrics when compared to none
at all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations,
regardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also
propose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We
demonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to
teach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call
to action in the field of XAI for more comprehensive evaluation techniques for
future research in order to prove explanation quality beyond user satisfaction.
Additionally, we present an analysis of the scenarios in which placebic or
actionable explanations would be most useful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in ethical and scalable conversational data collection for social science research by leveraging AI technology.

Method: MimiTalk uses a dual-agent setup with a supervisor model for strategic oversight and a conversational model for question generation. The framework is evaluated through three studies involving AI and human interviews.

Result: Results show that AI interviews using MimiTalk reduced interview anxiety, performed better in information richness, coherence, and stability, but human interviews excel in capturing cultural and emotional nuances.

Conclusion: Dual-agent constitutional AI frameworks like MimiTalk can support effective human-AI collaboration, enabling scalable and replicable high-quality qualitative research.

Abstract: We present MimiTalk, a dual-agent constitutional AI framework designed for
scalable and ethical conversational data collection in social science research.
The framework integrates a supervisor model for strategic oversight and a
conversational model for question generation. We conducted three studies: Study
1 evaluated usability with 20 participants; Study 2 compared 121 AI interviews
to 1,271 human interviews from the MediaSum dataset using NLP metrics and
propensity score matching; Study 3 involved 10 interdisciplinary researchers
conducting both human and AI interviews, followed by blind thematic analysis.
Results across studies indicate that MimiTalk reduces interview anxiety,
maintains conversational coherence, and outperforms human interviews in
information richness, coherence, and stability. AI interviews elicit technical
insights and candid views on sensitive topics, while human interviews better
capture cultural and emotional nuances. These findings suggest that dual-agent
constitutional AI supports effective human-AI collaboration, enabling
replicable, scalable and quality-controlled qualitative research.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Hyperchat AI facilitated human groups in predicting MLB games with high accuracy, outperforming Vegas odds and showing significant ROI potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large-scale human groups to discuss and solve complex issues while optimizing Collective Intelligence (CI).

Method: Networked groups of 24 sports fans used Hyperchat AI in real-time conversations to forecast winners of MLB games over 8 weeks.

Result: Groups achieved 78% accuracy in High Confidence picks, outperforming Vegas odds at 57%, with a potential ROI of 46%. High Confidence forecasts from more interactive deliberations reached 88% accuracy.

Conclusion: Hyperchat AI improves forecasting accuracy and amplifies Collective Intelligence, especially when conversations are highly interactive and dynamic.

Abstract: Hyperchat AI is a novel agentic technology that enables thoughtful
conversations among networked human groups of potentially unlimited size. It
allows large teams to discuss complex issues, brainstorm ideas, surface risks,
assess alternatives and efficiently converge on optimized solutions that
amplify the group's Collective Intelligence (CI). A formal study was conducted
to quantify the forecasting accuracy of human groups using Hyperchat AI to
conversationally predict the outcome of Major League Baseball (MLB) games.
During an 8-week period, networked groups of approximately 24 sports fans were
tasked with collaboratively forecasting the winners of 59 baseball games
through real-time conversation facilitated by AI agents. The results showed
that when debating the games using Hyperchat AI technology, the groups
converged on High Confidence predictions that significantly outperformed Vegas
betting markets. Specifically, groups were 78% accurate in their High
Confidence picks, a statistically strong result vs the Vegas odds of 57%
(p=0.020). Had the groups bet against the spread (ATS) on these games, they
would have achieved a 46% ROI against Vegas betting markets. In addition, High
Confidence forecasts that were generated through above-average conversation
rates were 88% accurate, suggesting that real-time interactive deliberation is
central to amplified accuracy.

*Liam Bakar,Zachary Englhardt,Vidya Srinivas,Girish Narayanswamy,Dilini Nissanka,Shwetak Patel,Vikram Iyer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces SnappyMeal, an AI-based dietary tracking system that uses multimodal inputs and goal-dependent interactions to improve logging flexibility and accuracy. Evaluations demonstrated strong user acceptance and enhanced tracking capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current food logging methods are inflexible, have low adherence, and yield inaccurate nutritional summaries. There is an urgent need for improved tracking methods to better correlate dietary habits with health outcomes.

Method: The authors propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system with multimodal inputs, goal-oriented follow-up prompts, and data retrieval from grocery receipts and nutritional databases to enhance food logging accuracy and flexibility. They evaluated this system using nutrition benchmarks and user deployments.

Result: During a 3-week deployment with multiple users logging over 500 food instances, SnappyMeal showed strong user engagement and positive feedback for flexibility and perceived accuracy, demonstrating improved dietary tracking.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI systems like SnappyMeal can enhance dietary tracking in terms of flexibility and context-awareness, paving the way for innovative self-tracking applications to better assist users.

Abstract: Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in
uncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes.
Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice
dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and
app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and
potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by
prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods.
In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that
leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food
intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to
intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from
user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We
evaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a
multi-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food
instances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and
reported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI
systems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility
and context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent
self-tracking applications.

TL;DR: This study investigates the impact of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT on novice programmers' metacognitive processes, analyzing dialogues and surveys from university programming courses to provide recommendations for AI design that enhances learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how generative AI tools affect students' metacognitive processes in programming education, addressing gaps beyond correctness and usability.

Method: Analyzed over 10,000 student-AI dialogue logs and conducted surveys of students and educators, focusing on the alignment of prompts and responses with metacognitive strategies.

Result: The research identified patterns in student-AI interactions and suggested design considerations for AI coding assistants to enhance metacognitive engagement.

Conclusion: Generative AI tools have the potential to support metacognitive processes, and careful design can strengthen learning outcomes in programming courses.

Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT now provide novice programmers with
unprecedented access to instant, personalized support. While this holds clear
promise, their influence on students' metacognitive processes remains
underexplored. Existing work has largely focused on correctness and usability,
with limited attention to whether and how students' use of AI assistants
supports or bypasses key metacognitive processes. This study addresses that gap
by analyzing student-AI interactions through a metacognitive lens in
university-level programming courses. We examined more than 10,000 dialogue
logs collected over three years, complemented by surveys of students and
educators. Our analysis focused on how prompts and responses aligned with
metacognitive phases and strategies. Synthesizing these findings across data
sources, we distill design considerations for AI-powered coding assistants that
aim to support rather than supplant metacognitive engagement. Our findings
provide guidance for developing educational AI tools that strengthen students'
learning processes in programming education.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tool for generating synthetic data to enhance LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, making criteria refinement and test case creation more efficient and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge approaches are limited by the lack of diverse, representative data for refining evaluation criteria, hindering effectiveness.

Method: The researchers developed a tool capable of generating synthetic test cases tailored to configurable parameters (domains, personas, lengths, outcomes) with AI-assisted inline editing and transparent generation processes.

Result: User study findings showed 83% of participants preferred using the tool over manual methods. The synthetic data generated was as effective as hand-crafted data for evaluation refinement and aligning human preferences.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation, when integrated into LLM-as-a-judge workflows, provides an efficient and scalable alternative for criteria refinement and evaluation in various contexts.

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm enables flexible, user-defined evaluation, but
its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity of diverse, representative
data for refining criteria. We present a tool that integrates synthetic data
generation into the LLM-as-a-judge workflow, empowering users to create
tailored and challenging test cases with configurable domains, personas,
lengths, and desired outcomes, including borderline cases. The tool also
supports AI-assisted inline editing of existing test cases. To enhance
transparency and interpretability, it reveals the prompts and explanations
behind each generation. In a user study (N=24), 83% of participants preferred
the tool over manually creating or selecting test cases, as it allowed them to
rapidly generate diverse synthetic data without additional workload. The
generated synthetic data proved as effective as hand-crafted data for both
refining evaluation criteria and aligning with human preferences. These
findings highlight synthetic data as a promising alternative, particularly in
contexts where efficiency and scalability are critical.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for addressing repeated optimal stopping problems over multiple rounds, ensuring both competitive ratio and sublinear regret.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design algorithms that balance achieving a competitive ratio in each round while maintaining sublinear regret across rounds in repeated optimal stopping problems.

Method: The proposed approach dynamically picks between two algorithms in each round: an empirically optimal algorithm based on previous observations and a sample-based algorithm with a guaranteed competitive ratio.

Result: The algorithm achieves a competitive ratio (e.g., $1/2$ for the prophet inequality problem) from the second round onwards, with a total regret bounded by $	ilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. A regret lower bound of $Omega(\sqrt{T})$ is also established.

Conclusion: The framework offered is broadly applicable to various optimal stopping problems and achieves near-optimal performance in terms of competitive ratio and regret minimization.

Abstract: We study the repeated optimal stopping problem, which generalizes the
classical optimal stopping problem with an unknown distribution to a setting
where the same problem is solved repeatedly over $T$ rounds. In this framework,
we aim to design algorithms that guarantee a competitive ratio in each round
while also achieving sublinear regret across all rounds.
  Our primary contribution is a general algorithmic framework that achieves
these objectives simultaneously for a wide array of repeated optimal stopping
problems. The core idea is to dynamically select an algorithm for each round,
choosing between two candidates: (1) an empirically optimal algorithm derived
from the history of observations, and (2) a sample-based algorithm with a
proven competitive ratio guarantee. Based on this approach, we design an
algorithm that performs no worse than the baseline sample-based algorithm in
every round, while ensuring that the total regret is bounded by
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.
  We demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework to canonical
problems, including the prophet inequality, the secretary problem, and their
variants under adversarial, random, and i.i.d. input models. For example, for
the repeated prophet inequality problem, our method achieves a
$1/2$-competitive ratio from the second round on and an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
regret. Furthermore, we establish a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$
even in the i.i.d. model, confirming that our algorithm's performance is almost
optimal with respect to the number of rounds.

### [350] [MIDI-LLM: Adapting Large Language Models for Text-to-MIDI Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03942)
*Shih-Lun Wu,Yoon Kim,Cheng-Zhi Anna Huang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MIDI-LLM is a model designed to generate multitrack MIDI music from text prompts, with improved quality, control, and speed compared to previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of efficient and high-quality models for generating multitrack MIDI music based on free-form text prompts.

Method: Develops a text LLM model by expanding its vocabulary to include MIDI tokens and employs a two-stage training approach, maintaining the original parameter structure to optimize inference using the vLLM library.

Result: MIDI-LLM provides higher quality MIDI generation, better adherence to text prompts, and faster inference performance compared to the Text2Midi model.

Conclusion: MIDI-LLM effectively combines text-to-MIDI abilities with efficiency and control, demonstrating promising results for MIDI-based generative tasks.

Abstract: We present MIDI-LLM, an LLM for generating multitrack MIDI music from
free-form text prompts. Our approach expands a text LLM's vocabulary to include
MIDI tokens, and uses a two-stage training recipe to endow text-to-MIDI
abilities. By preserving the original LLM's parameter structure, we can
directly leverage the vLLM library for accelerated inference. Experiments show
that MIDI-LLM achieves higher quality, better text control, and faster
inference compared to the recent Text2midi model. Live demo at

### [351] [MusRec: Zero-Shot Text-to-Music Editing via Rectified Flow and Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04376)
*Ali Boudaghi,Hadi Zare*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Introducing MusRec, the first zero-shot text-to-music editing model for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current music editing AI models struggle with limitations like editing only synthesized music, requiring specific prompts, and needing retraining.

Method: MusRec uses rectified flow and diffusion transformers to enable zero-shot text-based music editing capabilities.

Result: MusRec surpasses other methods by preserving musical content, maintaining structural consistency, and achieving high fidelity in edits.

Conclusion: MusRec establishes a robust framework for efficient and effective music editing in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Music editing has emerged as an important and practical area of artificial
intelligence, with applications ranging from video game and film music
production to personalizing existing tracks according to user preferences.
However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted
to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly
precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true
zero-shot capability. Leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and
diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, the first zero-shot text-to-music
editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music
efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural
consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for
controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.
