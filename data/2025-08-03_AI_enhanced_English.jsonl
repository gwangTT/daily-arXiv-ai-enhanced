Deep learning-based\ncomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate\npromising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical\ndeployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying\nconditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,\nwe investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness\nof malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a\ndomain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must\nadapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen\ndomains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two\nregularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site\nclinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and\nrehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.\nThese findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the\ndevelopment of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores using continual learning (CL) strategies to improve the adaptability and robustness of malaria diagnostic models for thin blood smear images across varying acquisition conditions.", "motivation": "The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying deep learning-based malaria CAD systems in low-resource settings with differing site conditions, where models often struggle to generalize effectively.", "method": "Continual learning techniques, including rehearsal-based and regularization-based methods, are applied to train a YOLO-based object detector on a multi-site clinical dataset, aiming to adapt to new conditions while retaining performance on previous domains.", "result": "Rehearsal-based continual learning methods significantly enhance the model's diagnostic performance across sites with domain shifts.", "conclusion": "Continual learning can play a key role in enhancing malaria CAD models, making them more suitable for deployment in diverse clinical settings."}}

However, these fully automatic methods often\nfail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological\nconstraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.\nIn medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of\nthe required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the\npixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and\nconstrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology\n(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional\ndata due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and\n3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological\ncorrectness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Automatic medical image segmentation methods excel in pixel-wise accuracy but ignore topology.
