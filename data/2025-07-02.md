### [1] [DiMo-GUI: Advancing Test-time Scaling in GUI Grounding via Modality-Aware Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00008)
*Hang Wu,Hongkai Chen,Yujun Cai,Chang Liu,Qingwen Ye,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiMo-GUI is a training-free framework for grounding language queries in GUIs, leveraging dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization for effective results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounding language queries in GUIs is challenging due to diverse visual elements, complex layouts, and language ambiguity, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The framework divides GUI inputs into textual and iconic elements for independent reasoning, dynamically refining ambiguous results through a hierarchical zoom-in process.

Result: DiMo-GUI achieves consistent improvements in performance over baseline methods on standard GUI grounding benchmarks.

Conclusion: By separating modalities and using dynamic region-focused reasoning, DiMo-GUI effectively improves language grounding in GUIs without requiring additional training or data.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

### [2] [TalentMine: LLM-Based Extraction and Question-Answering from Multimodal Talent Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00041)
*Varun Mannam,Fang Wang,Chaochun Liu,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current table extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding of tabular data, leading to poor retrieval performance. TalentMine, a novel LLM-based framework, addresses this by transforming tables into semantically enriched representations, showing superior results in talent management tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome the limitations of existing table extraction methods, which fail to capture semantic relationships in tabular data, causing issues in talent management applications where precision and decision-making are crucial.

Method: TalentMine employs a novel LLM-driven framework that utilizes multimodal reasoning to efficiently transform tables into semantically enriched representations, preserving both structural and semantic dimensions of the data.

Result: TalentMine achieved 100% accuracy in query-answering tasks, significantly outperforming AWS Textract extraction (0%) and AWS Textract Visual Q&A (40%) on employee benefits documentation. The Claude v3 Haiku model was identified as the best-performing model.

Conclusion: The study presents TalentMine as an effective solution for semantically understanding and retrieving information from tabular data in talent management systems. It highlights its transformational impact compared to existing solutions and its superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

### [3] [A collaborative digital twin built on FAIR data and compute infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00048)
*Thomas M. Deucher,Juan C. Verduzco,Michael Titus,Alejandro Strachan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study integrates machine learning and automated experimentation using FAIR data management to accelerate discovery. It creates a distributed self-driving laboratory framework for collaborative optimization tasks using nanoHUB tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance optimization and discovery efficiency by integrating machine learning and automated experimentation supported by a FAIR data infrastructure.

Method: A distributed SDL implementation developed on nanoHUB, utilizing Sim2L and ResultsDB tools. Researchers contribute data to a shared database and employ active learning for optimization tasks.

Result: The framework successfully allows geographically dispersed researchers to collaborate on optimization using online tools, real-time data sharing, and machine learning-driven models.

Conclusion: The developed tools and framework are generalizable and can be applied to other optimization problems, exemplified by optimizing food dye recipes to achieve specific target colors.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be
extended to other optimization problems.

### [4] [SEZ-HARN: Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00050)
*Devin Y. De Silva,Sandareka Wickramanayake,Dulani Meedeniya,Sanka Rasnayaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes SEZ-HARN, a framework for Zero-shot Human Activity Recognition (ZS-HAR) using IMU sensors that provides explainable skeleton video outputs while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of broad IMU datasets and the opacity of current ZS-HAR approaches limit their real-world application. This research aims to improve recognition and transparency simultaneously.

Method: The authors introduce SEZ-HARN, a novel model capable of recognizing unseen human activities and generating explainable skeleton videos to clarify its predictions.

Result: SEZ-HARN achieves Zero-shot accuracy within 3% of the highest-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 and performs comparably with others, while offering interpretable recognition results.

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN successfully balances competitive Zero-shot recognition accuracy with transparent decision-making through realistic skeleton video explanations.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities in SLMs with Reward Guided Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00054)
*Shreyansh Padarha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AdvDistill, a reward-guided dataset distillation framework that improves the student model's performance on reasoning tasks by assigning weights to teacher responses based on rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and deployability of Small Language Models (SLMs) while addressing limitations in knowledge distillation techniques, particularly for reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduce AdvDistill, which utilizes multiple teacher responses per prompt, assigns rewards via rule-based verifiers, and trains the student model using weighted responses.

Result: Demonstrated significant improvement in student model performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks using AdvDistill.

Conclusion: Incorporating a reward mechanism in dataset distillation enhances the efficacy of student models for reasoning challenges.

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

### [6] [VoyagerVision: Investigating the Role of Multi-modal Information for Open-ended Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00079)
*Ethan Smyth,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VoyagerVision, a multi-modal model that uses visual inputs for open-ended tasks in Minecraft, achieving notable success in constructing unique structures compared to its predecessor, Voyager.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance open-ended capabilities in AGI by utilizing visual inputs, leveraging advancements in LLMs to interpret spatial environments for better task performance.

Method: VoyagerVision integrates visual feedback through screenshots in a multi-modal system to guide structure creation in Minecraft, building on the Voyager framework.

Result: VoyagerVision successfully created an average of 2.75 unique structures in fifty iterations and passed 50% of unit tests in flat-world building scenarios, surpassing the baseline Voyager model.

Conclusion: Providing visual input to AI systems significantly enhances their ability to interpret environments and perform complex tasks, marking a step forward for open-ended AI research.

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

### [7] [Thinking About Thinking: SAGE-nano's Inverse Reasoning for Self-Aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00092)
*Basab Jha,Firoj Paudel,Ujjwal Puri,Zhang Yuting,Choi Donghyuk,Wang Junhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'inverse reasoning,' a novel approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain their reasoning chains post-hoc, improving interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in reasoning tasks but lack transparency in their decision-making processes, posing challenges for AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Method: The authors developed SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model that leverages inverse reasoning via a metacognitive framework to reflect on decision points and generate reasoning explanations.

Result: SAGE-nano achieved a reasoning accuracy of 74.6% on AQUA-RAT and an explanation quality score of 92.1% human preference, approaching performance levels of advanced models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning enhances interpretability and reasoning performance, contributing to safer and more transparent AI systems while addressing significant gaps in reasoning transparency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

### [8] [BlackBoxToBlueprint: Extracting Interpretable Logic from Legacy Systems using Reinforcement Learning and Counterfactual Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00180)
*Vidhi Rathore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline that uses reinforcement learning and decision trees to extract interpretable decision logic from legacy software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modernizing legacy systems is challenging because of lacking documentation and an understanding of intricate decision logic. Existing approaches fail to capture the intent underlying system behavior.

Method: The proposed pipeline uses an RL agent to find decision boundaries by rewarding meaningful output changes. Critical state transitions are clustered using K-Means, and decision trees are trained to extract interpretable rules.

Result: The method is tested on three dummy legacy systems with diverse complexities, successfully extracting accurate and human-readable decision rules from the systems.

Conclusion: This approach effectively captures the core logic of legacy systems, offering a basis for generating specifications and test cases, facilitating system modernization.

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

*Georgios P. Georgiou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines how ChatGPT affects student cognitive engagement during academic writing, finding it reduces deep thinking and is linked to cognitive offloading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate concerns that generative AI, like ChatGPT, may reduce deep cognitive engagement in academic activities.

Method: An experimental design where students were assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT) group or a control group, followed by completion of a writing task and a cognitive engagement scale.

Result: ChatGPT-assisted students scored significantly lower on cognitive engagement compared to the control group, indicating cognitive offloading.

Conclusion: AI tools like ChatGPT may hinder deep self-regulated learning, necessitating strategies for fostering reflective engagement when using such technologies in educational settings.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

*Periklis Petridis,Georgios Margaritis,Vasiliki Stoumpou,Dimitris Bertsimas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces xHAIM, an explainable AI framework for medicine, improving prediction accuracy and providing patient-specific clinical explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the HAIM framework by addressing its limitations in task-specific data usage and lack of explainability.

Method: xHAIM is built on four steps: identifying task-relevant data, generating patient summaries, using them for predictive modeling, and linking predictions to medical knowledge.

Result: xHAIM increases prediction accuracy (AUC improves from 79.9% to 90.3%) and offers explainable insights on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset.

Conclusion: xHAIM bridges the gap between AI advancements and clinical utility, transforming predictive models into explainable decision-support systems.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews progress on using machine learning to solve NP-hard routing problems like TSP and VRP, categorizing techniques into construction and improvement-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of exact algorithms (slow) and heuristics (non-optimal) by leveraging the potential of machine learning to solve complex routing problems efficiently.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy categorizing ML-based methods into two categories—construction-based and improvement-based—while integrating traditional optimization techniques with state-of-the-art ML models.

Result: The review organizes and analyzes ML approaches in routing problems and highlights their strengths and applicability to different scenarios and emerging VRP variants.

Conclusion: The paper provides a structured framework that combines traditional optimization with advanced ML methods to guide future research in solving complex routing challenges.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide
future research and address emerging VRP variants.

*Joongwon Kim,Anirudh Goyal,Liang Tan,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Srinivasan Iyer,Tianlu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTRO is a framework that trains language models to reason like search algorithms by leveraging structured search behavior from synthetic datasets and reinforcement learning (RL). It significantly improves reasoning capabilities in models like Llama 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance reasoning capabilities in non-reasoner language models, such as Llama 3, which do not inherently exhibit advanced reasoning and search behavior.

Method: ASTRO uses a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) problem-solving traces, converted into natural language chain-of-thoughts. These traces inform structured search behavior, which is further refined via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Applying ASTRO to the Llama 3 family showed absolute performance improvements: 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, particularly for challenging problems requiring iterative corrections.

Conclusion: Search-inspired training frameworks like ASTRO provide a scalable solution to instill robust reasoning capabilities in open-source large language models.

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates reasoning models tuned for math and finds RL-tuned models generalize well across domains, whereas SFT-tuned models do not, indicating over-reliance on SFT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the rapid progress in math reasoning tasks by large language models reflects genuine general problem-solving abilities or overfitting to narrow benchmarks.

Method: The authors evaluated 20+ open-weight reasoning-tuned models across diverse tasks and conducted controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models with different tuning methods (RL and SFT), analyzing their latent-space representations and output distribution shifts.

Result: Most math-focused models fail to transfer their abilities to broader tasks. RL-tuned models generalize effectively across domains, while SFT-tuned models experience representation drift and forget general capabilities.

Conclusion: The study suggests rethinking post-training strategies, especially the use of SFT-distilled data, as RL-tuned approaches demonstrate superior generalization and structural preservation.

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

### [14] [Advancing Local Search in SMT-NRA with MCSAT Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00557)
*Tianyi Ding,Haokun Li,Xinpeng Ni,Bican Xia,Tianqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved local search framework for SMT-NRA, integrating new techniques with MCSAT to enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in solving SMT-NRA problems by advancing local search methods and integrating recent techniques.

Method: The authors introduce a 2d-cell-jump move, a $2d$-LS framework, and integrate a sample-cell projection operator within MCSAT to guide searches more effectively. They also combine MCSAT, $2d$-LS, and OpenCAD into a hybrid framework.

Result: Experimental results show that the introduced methods improve the performance of local search for SMT-NRA.

Conclusion: The proposed methods and hybrid framework enhance search efficiency and highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced techniques for solving SMT-NRA.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory
of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a
two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in

### [15] [Can Large Language Models Develop Strategic Reasoning? Post-training Insights from Learning Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00726)
*Dongyoon Hwang,Hojoon Lee,Jaegul Choo,Dongmin Park,Jongho Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores developing strategic reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) in chess, finding that dense rewards outperform sparse ones but LLMs still underperform compared to experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether reinforcement learning can enhance strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in the context of chess.

Method: The study used a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense rewards for LLMs' move quality, akin to knowledge distillation. Sparse binary rewards were also compared. Ablation studies examined the effects of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL.

Result: Dense rewards enabled better performance than sparse rewards, but all tested models plateaued at performance levels far below chess experts.

Conclusion: Pretrained LLMs exhibit intrinsic limitations in their chess understanding, which RL alone cannot fully correct, highlighting a gap in developing advanced strategic reasoning through current techniques.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

*Siyuan Liang,Tianmeng Fang,Zhe Liu,Aishan Liu,Yan Xiao,Jinyuan He,Ee-Chien Chang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies security risks in multimodal intelligent agents, proposes a risk discrimination mechanism using behavioral sequences, and validates an automated assessment method for enhanced security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Threats posed by attackers exploiting multimodal intelligent agents for unauthorized or sensitive operations demand effective security mechanisms.

Method: The authors construct a behavioral sequence-informed risk discrimination mechanism and design an automated assessment strategy based on large language models.

Result: Preliminary validation shows improved detection of risky behaviors and reduced likelihood of agents being jailbroken.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into improving security risk modeling and protection measures for multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of current AI models and the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by emphasizing modular reasoning, memory integration, and adaptive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental challenge of creating AI systems that exhibit true general intelligence, similar to human cognition, reasoning, and adaptive capabilities.

Method: The authors provide a synthetic review of AGI development and emphasize approaches like Agentic RAG frameworks, modular reasoning, and memory integration, while reevaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Result: The analysis demonstrates how recent AI architectures are beginning to converge on adaptive, domain-agnostic intelligence through integration of memory, reasoning, and neurosymbolic systems.

Conclusion: The paper presents modular, interactive, and self-improving systems as the foundation for AGI, highlighting the need for compression, memory, and reasoning to achieve adaptive intelligence.

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe and reliable behavior of autonomous agents powered by large language models, and prevent unintended consequences during assistive tasks.

Method: The approach involves initializing causal influence diagrams based on tasks, guiding agent interactions using CIDs, and iteratively refining them based on outcomes and behaviors.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced safety in areas like code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Conclusion: Using causal influence diagrams can effectively mitigate decision-making risks and improve the safe operation of autonomous agents.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper focuses on creating hardware accelerators for the CKKS-targeting HHE ciphers HERA and Rubato to enhance performance and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ciphertext expansion and performance limitations in the client-side deployment of Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) using the ciphers HERA and Rubato.

Method: Developed hardware accelerators using an AMD Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA with designs that utilize vectorized and overlapped modules, exploit the transposition-invariance property, and decouple RNG and key computations.

Result: Rubato achieved a 6x throughput improvement, 5x latency reduction, and 75x energy efficiency. HERA achieved a 6x throughput improvement, 3x latency reduction, and 47x energy efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed hardware accelerators significantly improve the performance and energy efficiency of Rubato and HERA ciphers, making them more suitable for client-side deployment in HHE.

Abstract: Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) combines symmetric key and homomorphic
encryption to reduce ciphertext expansion crucial in client-server deployments
of HE. Special symmetric ciphers, amenable to efficient HE evaluation, have
been developed. Their client-side deployment calls for performant and
energy-efficient implementation, and in this paper we develop and evaluate
hardware accelerators for the two known CKKS-targeting HHE ciphers, HERA and
Rubato.
  We design vectorized and overlapped functional modules. The design exploits
transposition-invariance property of the MixColumns and MixRows function and
alternates the order of intermediate state to eliminate bubbles in stream key
generation, improving latency and throughput. We decouple the RNG and key
computation phases to hide the latency of RNG and to reduce the critical path
in FIFOs, achieving higher operating frequency.
  We implement the accelerator on an AMD Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA. Both Rubato
and HERA achieve a 6x improvement in throughput compared to the software
implementation. In terms of latency, Rubato achieves a 5x reduction, while HERA
achieves a 3x reduction. Additionally, our hardware implementations reduce
energy consumption by 75x for Rubato and 47x for HERA compared to their
software implementation.

TL;DR: ChatHLS is a design automation workflow for High-Level Synthesis using fine-tuned Large Language Models within a multi-agent framework. It achieves high repair rates and performance enhancements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware development faces challenges due to prolonged cycles, strict coding rules, and complex optimizations, which hinder developer productivity. High-Level Synthesis adoption struggles, while the rise of Large Language Models offers potential for automation.

Method: The paper presents ChatHLS, combining fine-tuned Large Language Models integrated into a multi-agent framework for optimizing hardware design and automating error correction.

Result: ChatHLS achieves a repair pass rate of 82.7%, outperforming GPT-4o and Llama3-8B by 19.1% and 63%, respectively. It also delivers speedup ranging from 1.9× to 14.8× compared to resource-constrained kernels, with a 4.9× geometric mean speedup over DSL-based approaches.

Conclusion: ChatHLS significantly accelerates hardware development cycles while preserving high standards in design reliability and optimization, showcasing its potential as a transformative tool in hardware design.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of computational demands has accelerated the
adoption of domain-specific accelerators, yet traditional hardware design
methodologies remain constrained by prolonged development and verification
cycles. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) bridges the gap between software and
hardware by enabling hardware design from high-level programming languages.
However, its widespread adoption is hindered by strict coding constraints and
intricate hardware-specific optimizations, creating significant obstacles for
developers. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
substantial potential in hardware design automation. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets, particularly
in the context of HLS. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatHLS, an
agile HLS design automation and optimization workflow that leverages fine-tuned
LLMs integrated within a multi-agent framework for error correction and design
optimization. Our extensive evaluations reveal that ChatHLS achieves an average
repair pass rate of 82.7% over 612 test cases, outperforming the GPT-4o and
Llama3-8B by 19.1% and 63.0%, respectively. Furthermore, ChatHLS delivers
performance enhancements ranging from 1.9$\times$ to 14.8$\times$ upon
resource-constrained kernels. By enabling sophisticated optimization reasoning
within practical computational budgets, ChatHLS attains a 4.9$\times$ geometric
mean speedup compared to state-of-the-art DSL-based approaches. These results
underscore the potential of ChatHLS in substantially expediting hardware
development cycles while maintaining rigorous standards of design reliability
and optimization quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally demanding, posing challenges for deployment on edge devices. The paper seeks to optimize LLM inference for resource-constrained environments.

Method: The method involves tri-optimizations in algorithm, hardware, and dataflow, including a novel KV cache eviction algorithm, flexible-product dataflow, runtime-reconfigurable PE array, and element-serial scheduling.

Result: The method reduces latency and hardware complexity from O(N) to O(1), realized in the custom accelerator VEDA, which outperforms existing platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed solution facilitates efficient LLM inference on edge devices, enhancing real-time processing, data privacy, and model customization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks but
pose significant computational and memory challenges for edge deployment due to
their intensive resource demands. This work addresses the efficiency of LLM
inference by algorithm-hardware-dataflow tri-optimizations. We propose a novel
voting-based KV cache eviction algorithm, balancing hardware efficiency and
algorithm accuracy by adaptively identifying unimportant kv vectors. From a
dataflow perspective, we introduce a flexible-product dataflow and a runtime
reconfigurable PE array for matrix-vector multiplication. The proposed approach
effectively handles the diverse dimensional requirements and solves the
challenges of incrementally varying sequence lengths. Additionally, an
element-serial scheduling scheme is proposed for nonlinear operations, such as
softmax and layer normalization (layernorm). Results demonstrate a substantial
reduction in latency, accompanied by a significant decrease in hardware
complexity, from O(N) to O(1). The proposed solution is realized in a
custom-designed accelerator, VEDA, which outperforms existing hardware
platforms. This research represents a significant advancement in LLM inference
on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating real-time processing,
enhancing data privacy, and enabling model customization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how well text-based and multimodal LLMs perform on table understanding tasks, focusing on multiple contexts and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in various tasks, but their capability with tabular data hasn't been thoroughly explored.

Method: The study uses a novel benchmark called TableEval to evaluate LLM performance across different table modalities and domains, including scientific and non-scientific contexts.

Result: LLMs show robustness across multiple modalities but struggle significantly with scientific tables.

Conclusion: While LLMs are versatile with table modalities, challenges remain with scientific tables, highlighting the need for further optimization in specific contexts.

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

TL;DR: The paper argues that prompting should be considered a legitimate scientific approach and key component in studying large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that prompting LLMs is less scientific and to argue for its validity as a behavioral science approach to studying these models.

Method: The paper reframes prompting as a behavioral science approach that investigates LLMs through their native language interface rather than dismissing it as a workaround or unscientific.

Result: Prompting is positioned as a powerful and integral method for unlocking and understanding the capabilities of LLMs, such as few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Prompting is a valid and necessary scientific method, akin to behavioral science, for exploring and understanding LLMs as complex, trained organisms.

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LineRetriever, a method for web navigation agents to retrieve relevant information efficiently for future action planning, addressing context limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web navigation methods face challenges in retaining critical information due to large web page contexts exceeding model limits, leading to suboptimal action predictions.

Method: The authors developed LineRetriever, which uses a language model to retrieve observation lines relevant to future actions, prioritizing planning horizon over traditional semantic similarity.

Result: Experiments showed that LineRetriever efficiently reduced observation sizes for web agents without degrading performance, within the constraints of model context limits.

Conclusion: LineRetriever offers an effective approach to optimize retrieval for adaptive planning by focusing on future-relevant data in web navigation tasks.

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage approach utilizing reasoning generated by large language models to improve text classification accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting the limitations of direct input-to-label mappings in standard models, this work seeks to enhance performance, robustness, and interpretability by incorporating explicit reasoning.

Method: The approach employs a two-stage process: 1) fine-tuning a reasoning generation model (Llama-R-Gen) using a general-purpose reasoning dataset, and 2) using this model to augment training datasets for downstream models that generate reasoning along with classifications.

Result: The reasoning-based generative model achieved an 8.7 percentage point increase in accuracy for emotion classification on the dair-ai/emotion dataset compared to a baseline model.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLM-generated reasoning into training datasets significantly improves text classification tasks by providing better generalization and explicit interpretability advantages.

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses how cultural differences lead to misaligned communication in translations, particularly in stylistic nuances like politeness. It proposes RASTA, a method to improve stylistic alignment using learned concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges where translations by LLMs fail to capture stylistic nuances, especially in non-Western languages, and bias translations towards neutrality.

Method: RASTA is a retrieval-augmented method that incorporates learned stylistic concepts to enhance translations and align them with cultural communication norms.

Result: RASTA successfully encourages translations to convey stylistic nuances and align better with cultural norms compared to standard LLM performance.

Conclusion: RASTA shows promise in mitigating stylistic misalignment in translations caused by cultural differences through retrieval-augmented techniques.

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

*Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reveals that harmful information suppressed in instruction-tuned LMs remains linearly decodable and can influence downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether harmful information suppressed in language models through tuning is still accessible or influential.

Method: The study trained linear probes on LM hidden states to decode suppressed data and analyzed correlation between refused and jailbroken outputs.

Result: Many refused properties remain linearly decodable, with correlations exceeding 0.8 in some cases. Probes trained on base models transfer effectively to tuned models.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning suppresses harmful information's direct expression but does not eliminate it, leaving it accessible and impactful in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

TL;DR: The paper develops a mathematical model for the morphology-syntax interface based on the Strong Minimalist Thesis, focusing on morphological trees and their connections with syntax through operadic algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically formalize the interface between morphology and syntax using principles from the Strong Minimalist Thesis, addressing challenges in understanding morphological composition and its interaction with syntax.

Method: The paper employs mathematical concepts like operads and coproduct decomposition to model the relationship between morphological and syntactic structures, leveraging Distributed Morphology to adjust the boundary between syntax and morphology.

Result: A detailed framework is presented where morphological trees are extended beyond the magma, forming morphosyntactic trees through operadic algebra and demonstrating flexibility in the syntax-morphology boundary.

Conclusion: The study provides a formal operadic framework for understanding structure formation in morphosyntactic trees, enabling advances in modeling linguistic phenomena and refining Distributed Morphology operations.

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

Method: The authors evaluated three open-source reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, Qwen 3) across four mathematical datasets and seven diverse languages, analyzing accuracy and token usage. They also translated non-English reasoning traces into English to study reasoning behavior changes.

Result: Non-English languages achieved reduced token usage while maintaining accuracy. Improvements persisted after translation, demonstrating genuine reasoning shifts. Improvement levels depend on the models’ multilingual training strength.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the potential of multilingual reasoning in LRMs and the importance of a strong multilingual foundation for achieving efficiency and accuracy beyond English.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

### [31] [Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00258)
*Jie Hou,Chuxiong Wu,Lannan Luo,Qiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the privacy risks, particularly data memorization, in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), comparing parameter-based and prompt-based fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored privacy risks, particularly data memorization, associated with fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors categorize fine-tuning approaches and use membership inference attacks (MIAs) to evaluate their impact on data memorization across these methods.

Result: Prompt-based fine-tuning exhibits lower vulnerability to memorization and MIAs compared to parameter-based fine-tuning, regardless of model size.

Conclusion: Prompt-based fine-tuning is a more privacy-preserving approach compared to parameter-based fine-tuning, which is more prone to leaking private information.

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

### [32] [Natural language processing for African languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00297)
*David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research targets improving NLP for Sub-Saharan African languages by curating higher-quality corpora, adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs), and creating large-scale labeled datasets for 21 African languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by low-resource languages in NLP, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, where noise in existing datasets and lack of labeled data hinders performance.

Method: The study curates high-quality corpora, evaluates multilingual pre-trained language models (PLMs) for low-resource scenarios, adapts PLMs to underserved African languages, and creates large-scale human-annotated datasets for named entity recognition and machine translation for 21 languages.

Result: The research demonstrates the importance of high-quality pre-training data, showcases the limitations of word embeddings, explores the potential of multilingual PLMs, and provides valuable labeled datasets for African languages.

Conclusion: Quality data and specialized adaptation techniques can significantly improve NLP outcomes for low-resource African languages, addressing their under-representation in NLP research.

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

### [33] [Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00322)
*Daking Rai,Samuel Miller,Kevin Moran,Ziyu Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why language models struggle with simple syntactic tasks like balanced parentheses. It identifies "sound" and "faulty" mechanisms in language models and proposes RASteer, a method to enhance performance by emphasizing reliable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate persistent language model errors in simple syntactic tasks like generating balanced parentheses, despite advancements in coding capabilities.

Method: The authors analyze attention heads and feedforward neurons in language models to classify them as "sound" or "faulty" mechanisms and develop RASteer, a steering method to prioritize "sound" mechanisms in predictions.

Result: RASteer improves performance on balanced parentheses tasks, raising accuracy from 0% to approximately 100% in some models. It also enhances performance in arithmetic reasoning tasks by up to 20%.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the internal mechanisms of language models and demonstrates the effectiveness of RASteer in improving syntactic and arithmetic reasoning tasks without compromising general coding abilities.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

### [34] [Modeling Data Diversity for Joint Instance and Verbalizer Selection in Cold-Start Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00330)
*Mohna Chakraborty,Adithya Kulkarni,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection method that enhances prompt-based techniques by reducing uncertainty and increasing diversity in cold-start few-shot learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based methods using pre-trained language models (PLMs) are sensitive to verbalizers, templates, and instance selection, particularly in scenarios without labeled data. There is a need for a more effective approach that addresses this sensitivity and considers the interplay between instance-label probabilities and verbalizer selection.

Method: The paper presents COLDSELECT, which maps PLM vocabulary and masked token embeddings into a shared space through dimensionality reduction and clustering. By optimizing for minimal uncertainty and maximal data diversity, it jointly selects verbalizers and few-shot instances.

Result: COLDSELECT outperforms baseline methods across eight benchmarks in verbalizer and instance selection, demonstrating superior generalization and reduced uncertainty in cold-start scenarios.

Conclusion: COLDSELECT effectively enhances the prompt-based methods by addressing their sensitivity to instance selection and verbalizers. It achieves this by leveraging a data-efficient approach that improves generalization in cold-start few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

### [35] [Question Decomposition for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00355)
*Paul J. L. Ammann,Jonas Golde,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that uses question decomposition and reranking to improve multi-hop question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles with multi-hop questions where relevant information is scattered across multiple documents, making it hard to retrieve sufficient evidence.

Method: The method involves (i) decomposing the query into sub-questions using an LLM, (ii) retrieving relevant passages for each sub-question, and (iii) reranking the merged results using a cross-encoder reranker before answer generation.

Result: The method improves retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy (F1: +11.6%) on datasets like MultiHop-RAG and HotpotQA compared to standard RAG.

Conclusion: Pairing question decomposition with reranking enhances multi-hop retrieval performance effectively, without requiring additional training or specialized indexing.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

*Vojtěch Lanz,Jan Hajič jr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores segmentation in Gregorian chants, applying hierarchical Pitman-Yor models to identify melodic patterns for mode classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the frequent re-use of melodic segments in Gregorian chants and evaluate centonisation theory for better understanding modality and memory efficiency.

Method: Used unsupervised segmentation through nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language models to analyze melodic patterns and their role in mode classification.

Result: Achieved advanced performance in mode classification, highlighting links between segmentation, modality, and memory efficiency in Gregorian chant melodies.

Conclusion: Despite success in mode classification and memory efficiency, the segmentation results challenge traditional centonisation notions.

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

### [37] [Causal Prompting for Implicit Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00389)
*Jing Ren,Wenhao Zhou,Bowen Li,Mujie Liu,Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Jiade Cen,Liping Chen,Ziqi Xu,Xiwei Xu,Xiaodong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPITAL is a causal prompting framework for implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) using large language models (LLMs), aiming to address biases and spurious correlations by decomposing causal effects and aligning reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit sentiment analysis requires identifying subtle contextual cues beyond explicit sentiment, necessitating models capable of deeper reasoning. Current LLM methods face challenges with internal biases and correlations.

Method: The proposed CAPITAL framework integrates causal inference into chain-of-thought reasoning through front-door adjustment. It uses encoder-based clustering, NWGM approximation, and a contrastive learning objective to align representations.

Result: CAPITAL demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness over baseline methods in ISA tasks on benchmark datasets, especially under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: Integrating causal inference into LLM prompting improves bias-aware sentiment reasoning, validating CAPITAL's approach for ISA tasks and providing promising accuracy gains.

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of aligning language models with the diverse perspectives of various population groups when answering subjective questions.

Method: The authors utilized relatively simple supervision techniques to enhance the language models' alignment, evaluated the approach across multiple datasets, and tested it on various LLMs and prompting strategies while open-sourcing their work.

Result: Their approach improved the alignment of language models with diverse population groups over three datasets, highlighting its effectiveness and the variation of performance across specific groups.

Conclusion: The simplicity and generality of the method make it easy to adopt and provide practical insights for its application. The research also establishes a benchmark to inspire future work in this area.

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

*Md. Najib Hasan,Mohammad Fakhruddin Babar,Souvika Sarkar,Monowar Hasan,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open benchmarks for large language models are useful for standardized comparisons, but they are vulnerable to exploitation by models 'cheating' the protocols, suggesting the need for complementary private/dynamic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to expose the vulnerabilities of open LLM benchmarks, which, while crucial for transparency and standardization, can be exploited by models fine-tuned to cheat the evaluation systems.

Method: Using smaller versions of BART, T5, and GPT-2, the study creates models specifically fine-tuned on public test sets to demonstrate how these 'cheating' models achieve high scores without true generalization.

Result: The cheating models attained top rankings on the HELM benchmark, showcasing that performance on open benchmarks can be misleading and may not reflect real-world usability.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need to complement open benchmarks with private or dynamic alternatives and rethink current benchmarking practices to ensure reliable evaluation of language models.

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating advertisements into generative conversational systems using a pipeline that incorporates ad-rewriters for smooth integration and ad-classifiers for detection, achieving seamless and minimally intrusive ad insertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the transparency and trust issues arising from blending advertisements with informational content in generative conversational systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Method: The authors propose a modular pipeline with two key components: an ad-rewriter (for integrating ads) and an ad-classifier (for detecting ads). They generate synthetic data to train the classifiers, use supervised fine-tuning for the ad-rewriter, and implement best-of-N sampling to choose the least detectable ad-inserted response.

Result: The study shows that their ad-classifier, trained using synthetic data and curriculum learning, performs robustly in detecting various ad strategies. Furthermore, the classifier-guided optimization enhances ad stealth and coherence during integration, improving user experience.

Conclusion: The paper establishes an adversarial co-evolution framework for advancing generative search systems and creating more effective ad-aware classifiers, ensuring seamless and transparent ad integration while maintaining user trust.

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in evaluating continual learning for ASR under realistic, real-world conditions.

Method: The framework uses 3250 hours of speech data collected across 22 languages and 208 districts in India, creating natural episodes highlighting varying language and domain shifts.

Result: Existing CL methods were evaluated and found to be inconsistent, revealing the need for improvements in CL strategies.

Conclusion: Nirantar highlights the limitations of current CL methods and provides a robust benchmarking environment for future research.

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Capsule Networks-based algorithm for enhancing semantic intent recognition in human-computer interaction, showing superior accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in semantic intent recognition accuracy for human-computer interactions.

Method: Employ a Capsule Network architecture with dynamic routing mechanisms, convolutional feature extraction, margin-based loss functions, and experiments using public datasets.

Result: The proposed model outperformed mainstream methods in accuracy, F1-score, and intent detection rate, proving effectiveness in handling complex semantics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a stable and effective structured modeling approach for improving intent recognition in semantic contexts.

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

*Mustafa Chasmai,Gauri Jagatap,Gouthaman KV,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Andrea Fanelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'moment sampling,' a method to address challenges in VideoQA for long videos by using a moment retrieval model to select crucial frames instead of uniform sub-sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with long-range reasoning in lengthy videos due to inefficiencies in conventional frame sub-sampling, which either misses critical frames or retains redundant ones.

Method: The authors employ a lightweight text-to-video moment retrieval model to guide the selection of the most relevant frames for a given question, improving the efficiency and relevance of frame sampling.

Result: The experiments reveal that 'moment sampling' significantly enhances performance across four long-form VideoQA datasets using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed moment sampling approach effectively addresses limitations in long-form VideoQA, improving accuracy and reducing unnecessary computational load.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Method: The proposed ER-EMU algorithm uses an adaptive experience buffer managed by a FIFO principle and a Domain Distance Metric-based Experience Selection (DDM-ES) utilizing multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to prioritize diverse and relevant historical data.

Result: Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset demonstrate improved performance of state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative object detection frameworks across repeated day/night cycles when using ER-EMU.

Conclusion: ER-EMU effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting by prioritizing and leveraging historical data, ensuring diverse training and preventing overfitting to new domain data, thus improving model adaptability and performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

*Mehmet Yigit Avci,Pedro Borges,Paul Wright,Mehmet Yigitsoy,Sebastien Ourselin,Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MR-CLIP, a framework that uses multimodal contrastive learning to align MRI scans with DICOM metadata for contrast-aware representation, addressing challenges like incomplete labels and noisy metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in interpreting MRI scans caused by missing, inconsistent, or noisy metadata, as well as the lack of reliable contrast-aware representations.

Method: A multimodal contrastive learning framework, MR-CLIP, is designed to align MR images with their DICOM metadata, learning contrast-aware representations without requiring manual labels.

Result: MR-CLIP demonstrated effectiveness in tasks like cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, achieving anatomy-invariant representations and scalability across diverse clinical datasets.

Conclusion: MR-CLIP advances MRI interpretation by providing robust contrast-aware representations, enhancing clinical workflows, and is made accessible via open-source code and weights.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

### [47] [Room Scene Discovery and Grouping in Unstructured Vacation Rental Image Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00263)
*Vignesh Ram Nithin Kappagantula,Shayan Hassantabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops a machine learning pipeline to categorize vacation rental property images and detect bed types in bedrooms for improved spatial understanding, excelling over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vacation rental platforms encounter challenges due to unstructured image categorization, making it difficult for travelers to grasp property layouts, especially for repeated room types.

Method: The proposed pipeline utilizes a supervised room-type detection model, overlap similarity detection through a supervised method, clustering to group room images, and MLLM for assigning bed types based on visual and metadata alignment.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated strong performance, surpassing traditional methods like contrastive learning and clustering with pretrained embeddings.

Conclusion: Their proposed approach effectively organizes property images for better user comprehension, proving both computational efficiency and suitability for real-time applications in scarce data environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

*Seyed Kahaki,Alexander R. Webber,Ghada Zamzmi,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Rucha Deshpande,Aldo Badano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of diagnostic artifacts in Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) for cancer diagnostics by proposing three detection methods: foundation model-based, deep learning, and knowledge-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning can negatively affect downstream image analysis in digital histopathology, necessitating effective detection methods.

Method: Three methods were proposed and compared: 1) a foundation model-based approach using a Unified Neural Image architecture, 2) a deep learning model based on ResNet50, and 3) a knowledge-based method using handcrafted texture, color, and frequency features. Six artifact types were screened.

Result: The foundation model-based approach achieved the best performance (AUROC: 0.995), followed by the deep learning approach (AUROC: 0.977) and the knowledge-based approach (AUROC: 0.940).

Conclusion: The proposed artifact detection methods improve the reliability of WSI image analysis, enabling actionable quality insights and artifact visualization.

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

*Ming Li,Chenguang Wang,Yijun Liang,Xiyao Wang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Yuqing Zhang,Ruiyi Zhang,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-o3, an advanced Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM), to determine its capabilities in detective-like reasoning tasks with visual cues but identifies a task class, CaughtCheating, where it performs poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether advanced MLLMs like GPT-o3 can match human-level detective reasoning capabilities in challenging visual scenarios.

Method: The authors examine GPT-o3's performance in hard visual reasoning tasks inspired by real-life social media scenarios involving detection of suspicious clues in images.

Result: GPT-o3 excels in expert-level tasks like GeoGuesser but shows significant shortcomings in solving CaughtCheating tasks, where its performance drops to nearly zero.

Conclusion: The CaughtCheating tasks highlight limitations in current MLLMs' visual perception and reasoning abilities, indicating areas for improvement to achieve human-level detective capabilities.

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

*Akshansh Mishra,Eyob Mesele Sefene,Shivraman Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evolutionary computing approach using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for improved defect detection and material interface analysis in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD) processes, utilizing novel visualization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more precise and automated method for detecting defects and analyzing material interfaces in AFSD processes, overcoming the limitations of conventional imaging techniques.

Method: The proposed method employs PSO to determine optimal segmentation thresholds, integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance transforms, and uses novel attention-weighted multi-channel visualization techniques for critical interface analysis.

Result: The PSO algorithm determined effective segmentation thresholds for precise material interface analysis, while multi-channel visualization enhanced the detection of transition zones and defects, highlighting regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully identifies material defects and inhomogeneities in AFSD components, providing a foundation for improved quality control and optimization in additive manufacturing processes.

Abstract: This work proposes an evolutionary computing-based image segmentation
approach for analyzing soundness in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD)
processes. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed to determine optimal
segmentation thresholds for detecting defects and features in multilayer AFSD
builds. The methodology integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance
transforms to create novel attention-weighted visualizations that highlight
critical interface regions. Five AFSD samples processed under different
conditions were analyzed using multiple visualization techniques i.e.
self-attention maps, and multi-channel visualization. These complementary
approaches reveal subtle material transition zones and potential defect regions
which were not readily observable through conventional imaging. The PSO
algorithm automatically identified optimal threshold values (ranging from
156-173) for each sample, enabling precise segmentation of material interfaces.
The multi-channel visualization technique effectively combines boundary
information (red channel), spatial relationships (green channel), and material
density data (blue channel) into cohesive representations that quantify
interface quality. The results demonstrate that attention-based analysis
successfully identifies regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities in
AFSD joints, providing quantitative metrics for process optimization and
quality assessment of additively manufactured components.

### [51] [AdaDeDup: Adaptive Hybrid Data Pruning for Efficient Large-Scale Object Detection Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00049)
*Feiyang Kang,Nadine Chang,Maying Shen,Marc T. Law,Rafid Mahmood,Ruoxi Jia,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AdaDeDup, a framework combining density-based and model-informed pruning methods to efficiently reduce data redundancy and improve training efficiency for large-scale machine learning, maintaining near-original performance while pruning significant portions of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training of large-scale machine learning models is challenged by computational demands and data redundancy in large datasets, prompting the need for efficient pruning methods.

Method: AdaDeDup employs a hybrid framework combining density-based data pruning with model-informed feedback. It adapts pruning thresholds cluster-wise based on task-aware evaluation by a proxy model, enabling retention of valuable data and aggressive pruning of redundant clusters.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Waymo, COCO, and nuScenes show AdaDeDup achieves near-original performance while pruning up to 20% of data and outperforms other baseline methods.

Conclusion: AdaDeDup proves effective for enhancing data efficiency in the training of large-scale models by integrating adaptive and task-aware data pruning mechanisms, with open-sourced code for broader application.

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VSF--Med, a framework to evaluate vulnerabilities in medical Vision Language Models (VLMs), using adversarial attacks and a scoring rubric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic security evaluations for Vision Language Models in medical imaging workflows.

Method: Develop an end-to-end vulnerability scoring framework featuring adversarial text prompts, subtle visual perturbations, and an evaluation rubric by judge LLMs.

Result: Built over 30,000 adversarial variants to benchmark vulnerabilities, reporting z-score shifts indicative of vulnerability across state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: VSF--Med facilitates security benchmarking of medical VLMs, emphasizing the need to address vulnerabilities in these systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

TL;DR: MANTA unifies visual and auditory inputs into a textual structured space for optimized multimodal learning, achieving significant performance gains in tasks like Long Video Question Answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal learning approaches treat visual and auditory data separately, leading to inconsistencies in representation and reasoning.

Method: MANTA uses semantic alignment, adaptive temporal synchronization, hierarchical content representation, and context-aware retrieval within a mathematical framework optimized for token constraints.

Result: MANTA achieves up to 22.6% improvement in overall accuracy, including 27.3% on long videos and significant gains in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding tasks.

Conclusion: MANTA establishes a unified approach for multimodal learning by leveraging textual structured space for seamless integration and improved task performance.

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

TL;DR: This paper develops a system for automated plant disease detection using advanced YOLO models, achieving high performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges posed by plant diseases in agriculture by proposing an automated method for early detection to reduce crop damage and enhance productivity.

Method: Transfer learning was applied using fine-tuned YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 models on a dataset of plant leaf images to detect disease types including bacterial, fungal, and viral issues.

Result: The YOLOv8 model achieved strong evaluation metrics: mean Average Precision (91.05), F1-score (89.40), Precision (91.22), and Recall (87.66), demonstrating its efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings affirm YOLOv8 as an effective solution for early plant disease detection, offering scalable and sustainable benefits to agriculture.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learning-based perception algorithms for outdoor robots struggle in rapidly changing environments like snow. This paper introduces a diffusion-based image augmentation technique leveraging foundation models and semantic filtering to make training data more representative of target deployment conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of learning-based perception algorithm performance in out-of-distribution environments, particularly for autonomous vehicles in challenging snow-filled settings.

Method: A novel diffusion-based image augmentation approach is proposed, utilizing vision foundation models for generating environment-specific variations in training data, combined with open vocabulary semantic segmentation to exclude unrealistic augmentations.

Result: The proposed diffusion-based augmentation enhances training datasets by semantically matching the target deployment environments, mitigating performance drops in underrepresented scenarios.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based image augmentations can effectively prepare learning-based perception systems for deployment in snow-filled and other complex environments, improving adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed
in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are
particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to
dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes
underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system.
In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for
deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for
diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment
environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on
the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale
datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over
the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to
fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary
semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain
hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be
extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy
environments and volcanic terrains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FreeLong and FreeLong++, training-free frameworks to improve long video generation via frequency distribution balance, achieving better temporal consistency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of temporal inconsistency and visual fidelity degradation commonly observed when extending text-to-video generation models to create longer videos.

Method: FreeLong introduces a dual-branch framework that balances low-frequency (global) and high-frequency (local) features to address high-frequency distortion, while FreeLong++ extends this to a multi-branch architecture with varying temporal scales for enhanced frequency fusion.

Result: FreeLong++ significantly improves the temporal consistency and visual quality of longer videos by augmenting existing video generation models without additional training.

Conclusion: FreeLong++ provides a versatile, efficient solution for longer video generation, enabling smoother scene transitions, coherent multi-prompt integration, and controllable outputs using long depth or pose sequences.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short
video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer
videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal
consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively
applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable
quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where
high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,
an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose
FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency
distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong
achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic
semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted
from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,
FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture
with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.
By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables
multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both
semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video
sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into
existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer
videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video
generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent
multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables
controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

TL;DR: SelvaBox is the largest open-access dataset for tropical tree crown detection, featuring over 83,000 manually labeled crowns from high-resolution drone images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist in studying tropical forest ecosystems, which are impacted by human activity and climate change, by overcoming the lack of annotated datasets for tree crown detection.

Method: SelvaBox was created using high-resolution drone imagery across three countries, benchmarking its effectiveness with models trained on the dataset, and developing a unified multi-resolution training pipeline.

Result: Models trained on SelvaBox exhibit strong performance, achieving competitive results on unseen datasets and performing well across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SelvaBox provides a valuable new resource for tropical forest research by advancing tree crown detection capabilities and making tools and data publicly available for further study and application.

Abstract: Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study
these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and
climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and
pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote
sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in
tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering
robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access
dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It
spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns -
an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets
combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1)
higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models
trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection
performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding
competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other
datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified
multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all
evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

TL;DR: The study presents a novel Graph Neural Network-based method for segmenting individual plant components in 3D LiDAR Point Cloud data and achieves over 80% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using 2D imaging, 3D reconstructions, and CNNs exhibit limitations in processing 3D data and identifying individual plant components.

Method: The proposed method uses a GNN-based architecture that integrates PCA for feature enhancement, KNN for edge creation, Edge-Conv layers for feature improvement, and GAT for component classification in 3D LiDAR Point Cloud data.

Result: The approach achieved over 80% average IoU accuracy, surpassing traditional models in segmentation performance.

Conclusion: This graph-based deep learning method provides a significant improvement in segmenting plant components from 3D data, making it a superior alternative to existing methodologies.

Abstract: In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop
production is identifying individual plant components. There are several
attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D
reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have
several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant
components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning
architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on
the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex
and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,
thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used
to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the
plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our
graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for
identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the
IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.

*Changsoo Jung,Sheikh Mannan,Jack Fitzgerald,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiboSB, a 6D pose video dataset, to address challenges in collaborative group work by estimating object positions and orientations in 3D space. It evaluates state-of-the-art methods and proposes fine-tuning YOLO11-x to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems fail to accurately capture real-world interactions between students and physical objects, especially in collaborative educational contexts. 6D pose estimation offers a solution by connecting objects and entities.

Method: The authors created the FiboSB dataset with video recordings of groups solving interactive tasks using small cubes and weight scales. They evaluated four 6D pose estimation methods and improved detection accuracy by fine-tuning YOLO11-x.

Result: Fine-tuning YOLO11-x yielded better object detection performance with an mAP_50 score of 0.898. Error analysis highlighted failures in detection modules across current methods.

Conclusion: The dataset and findings provide critical insights for improving 6D pose estimation methods, paving the way for enhanced AI systems in collaborative educational contexts.

Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational
frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters
deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing
systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions
between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with
automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and
orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups
that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to
relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel
and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants
solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.
This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically
recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled
with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently
non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on
FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group
work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'
object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for
FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,
and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for
leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

*Chi-Yao Huang,Zeel Bhatt,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOCAL reimagines visual odometry (VO) using contrastive learning and Bayesian inference for camera state estimation, improving interpretability and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, limiting interpretability and lacking robust theoretical foundations.

Method: VOCAL uses contrastive learning to frame VO as a label ranking challenge, aligning visual features with camera states using Bayesian inference.

Result: Evaluations on the KITTI dataset show enhanced interpretability and flexibility of VOCAL over traditional VO methods.

Conclusion: VOCAL advances VO towards general, explainable spatial intelligence by leveraging data-driven and multimodal-friendly frameworks.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is
crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many
learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often
fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully
data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL
(Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines
VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a
representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror
camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge
into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space.
This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned
features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive
evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability
and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial
intelligence.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GazeTarget360, a first-of-its-kind system for 360-degree gaze target estimation in generalized visual scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable robots to understand human gaze targets for downstream tasks like attention estimation and movement anticipation, which are critical in human-robot interaction.

Method: The authors propose GazeTarget360, which combines conditional inference engines, including an eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion decoder, to estimate 360-degree gaze targets from images.

Result: Cross-validation results demonstrate that GazeTarget360 is accurate and reliable in predicting gaze targets in unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: GazeTarget360 represents an innovative, efficient, and deployable solution for gaze target estimation from realistic camera footage, advancing the field of human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow
capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and
movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have
addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches
by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation
methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in
images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away
from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of
360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.
The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an
eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion
decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate
and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a
first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage
which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presentation of VirtualFencer, a system that analyzes fencing motions and strategies from videos to generate realistic fencing behaviors independently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of fencing that combines diverse motion patterns and underlying strategy influenced by the opponent's actions, leveraging data-driven techniques for analysis and realistic fencing behavior generation.

Method: The system extracts 3D motion and strategic patterns from fencing videos without supervision and uses these insights to recreate realistic fencing behavior, including simulations and interactions.

Result: VirtualFencer can self-play, simulate fencing motions from online videos, and interactively compete against professional fencers, showcasing its versatility.

Conclusion: VirtualFencer demonstrates its capability in analyzing and generating diverse and strategic fencing behaviors autonomously, bridging video analysis with practical interaction potential in fencing.

Abstract: Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical
motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step,
lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small,
offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a
strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This
combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates
the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a
system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild
video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate
realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our
system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a
real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a
professional fencer.

TL;DR: This study introduces a self-supervised pipeline leveraging synthetic X-rays to generate correspondences, aiming to improve multi-view fracture detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately interpreting multi-view radiographs is critical for clinical diagnoses, but current AI methods struggle with establishing correspondences between views.

Method: The authors use a self-supervised pipeline involving transformer-based training and synthetic digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to create many-to-many correspondence matrices.

Result: The method demonstrated improved performance in multi-view fracture classification by leveraging correspondences during pretraining.

Conclusion: Incorporating synthetic correspondences enhances AI's capability to analyze multi-view radiographs, improving fracture detection without manual annotations.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CrossPipe is a framework to optimize the training of large language models across datacenters, addressing the challenges of network latency and bandwidth constraints, achieving up to 33.6% reduction in training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of training large language models, which often requires distributed datacenters due to the resource intensity, and aims to mitigate the effects of network latency and bandwidth limitations.

Method: CrossPipe integrates pipeline parallelism and overlapping data parallelism, using solver-based or greedy algorithms for optimized pipeline scheduling and a flexible execution engine to improve efficiency.

Result: The evaluation shows CrossPipe reduces training time by up to 33.6%, maintains strong performance under relaxed memory constraints, and improves scalability in environments with network limitations.

Conclusion: CrossPipe effectively optimizes training across distributed environments, offering significant time savings, scalability, and efficiency despite challenges with network latency and bandwidth.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) now requires resources that exceed a
single datacenter, making cross-datacenter strategies increasingly crucial. We
present CrossPipe, a framework designed to optimize model training across
geographically distributed datacenters by explicitly modeling and mitigating
the impact of network latency and limited bandwidth. It enables unified
analysis and optimization incorporating both pipeline parallelism (PP) and
opportunities for overlapping data parallelism (DP) communication. CrossPipe
generates optimized pipeline schedules using either solver-based optimal or
fast near-optimal greedy algorithms, built upon a flexible execution engine
that separates scheduling logic from communication details. Our evaluation
shows that CrossPipe reduces training time by up to 33.6\% compared to
traditional pipeline schedules under identical memory constraints. When memory
constraints are relaxed, CrossPipe maintains strong performance despite
communication delays, approaching the efficiency of idealized schedules without
delays. CrossPipe offers improved scalability and resource utilization,
particularly in environments with high network latency or limited bandwidth.

TL;DR: PANDAS proposes a solution for integrating data availability sampling (DAS) with Ethereum's Danksharding evolution, improving layer-2 data dissemination and sampling efficiency within 4-second slots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethereum's scalability is limited despite Layer-2 protocols; Danksharding evolution seeks efficient selective distribution of Layer-2 data using DAS within strict latency constraints.

Method: PANDAS employs lightweight direct exchanges for disseminating and sampling Layer-2 data, accommodating challenges such as message loss, node failures, and scalability demands without modifying Ethereum's protocols.

Result: Evaluation of PANDAS in a 1,000-node cluster and simulations for up to 20,000 peers demonstrate its ability to meet 4-second deadlines under planetary-scale latencies.

Conclusion: PANDAS effectively tackles Ethereum's DAS integration challenges, supporting scalability and reliability while respecting strict time limits without altering existing protocols.

Abstract: Layer-2 protocols can assist Ethereum's limited throughput, but globally
broadcasting layer-2 data limits their scalability. The Danksharding evolution
of Ethereum aims to support the selective distribution of layer-2 data, whose
availability in the network is verified using randomized data availability
sampling (DAS). Integrating DAS into Ethereum's consensus process is
challenging, as pieces of layer-2 data must be disseminated and sampled within
four seconds of the beginning of each consensus slot. No existing solution can
support dissemination and sampling under such strict time bounds.
  We propose PANDAS, a practical approach to integrate DAS with Ethereum under
Danksharding's requirements without modifying its protocols for consensus and
node discovery. PANDAS disseminates layer-2 data and samples its availability
using lightweight, direct exchanges. Its design accounts for message loss, node
failures, and unresponsive participants while anticipating the need to scale
out the Ethereum network. Our evaluation of PANDAS's prototype in a 1,000-node
cluster and simulations for up to 20,000 peers shows that it allows layer-2
data dissemination and sampling under planetary-scale latencies within the
4-second deadline.

TL;DR: LLM-Mesh introduces a serverless inference solution for small-to-mid-sized LLMs that effectively utilizes heterogeneous hardware, achieving enhanced computational efficiency and resource sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underutilization of modern CPU architectures with built-in accelerators and explores ways to make both CPUs and GPUs effectively serve LLMs for private serverless deployments.

Method: LLM-Mesh tackles challenges through fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level, memory scaling mechanisms to detect hazards, and reducing resource fragmentation via proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing.

Result: Experiments on mixed hardware setups show improvements in service capacity by 44%-63%, and leveraging CPUs further boosts this to 91%-159% capacity enhancement.

Conclusion: LLM-Mesh demonstrates the potential for elastic sharing across heterogeneous hardware, enhancing serverless inference capabilities for LLMs and optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: The rise of LLMs has driven demand for private serverless deployments,
characterized by moderate-scale models and infrequent requests. While existing
solutions follow exclusive GPU deployment, we take a step back to explore
modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in
accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both
CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously.
  We propose LLM-Mesh, a serverless inference scheme for small-to-mid-sized
LLMs that enables elastic sharing across heterogeneous hardware. LLM-Mesh
tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute
resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands;
(2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect
out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach
that reduces resource fragmentation through proactive preemption and reactive
bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that
LLM-Meshimproves service capacity by 44% - 63% through sharing, while further
leveraging CPUs boosts this to 91% - 159%.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SYNPA, a novel thread-to-core (T2C) allocation policy for SMT ARM processors leveraging the Instructions and Stalls Cycles (ISC) stack to address inter-application interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize performance in SMT ARM processors while addressing challenges posed by inter-application interference using improved thread-to-core allocation policies.

Method: Proposed the ISC stack as a novel approach to build accurate performance stacks and used it as input for performance prediction models, culminating in the design of the SYNPA family of T2C allocation policies.

Result: The SYNPA4 variant outperformed Linux by 38% in turnaround time, achieving three times the gains of state-of-the-art policies for ARM processors.

Conclusion: The SYNPA approach demonstrates significant performance improvements and provides a universally applicable framework for building accurate performance stacks across various SMT processors.

Abstract: Modern high-performance servers commonly integrate Simultaneous
Multithreading (SMT) processors, which efficiently boosts throughput over
single-threaded cores. Optimizing performance in SMT processors faces
challenges due to the inter-application interference within each SMT core. To
mitigate the interference, thread-to-core (T2C) allocation policies play a
pivotal role. State-of-the-art T2C policies work in two steps: i) building a
per-application performance stack using performance counters and ii) building
performance prediction models to identify the best pairs of applications to run
on each core.
  This paper explores distinct ways to build the performance stack in ARM
processors and introduces the Instructions and Stalls Cycles (ISC) stack, a
novel approach to overcome ARM PMU limitations. The ISC stacks are used as
inputs for a performance prediction model to estimate the applications'
performance considering the inter-application interference. The accuracy of the
prediction model (second step) depends on the accuracy of the performance stack
(first step); thus, the higher the accuracy of the performance stack, the
higher the potential performance gains obtained by the T2C allocation policy.
  This paper presents SYNPA as a family of T2C allocation policies.
Experimental results show that $SYNPA4$, the best-performing SYNPA variant,
outperforms turnaround time by 38\% over Linux, which represents 3$\times$ the
gains achieved by the state-of-the-art policies for ARM processors.
Furthermore, the multiple discussions and refinements presented throughout this
paper can be applied to other SMT processors from distinct vendors and are
aimed at helping performance analysts build performance stacks for accurate
performance estimates in real processors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud systems face challenges in handling rapid resource variations and uncertain task loads, requiring better scaling mechanisms for efficiency.

Method: The method uses multi-agent systems with collaborative value functions and reinforcement learning for elastic scaling, implementing a lightweight prediction model for foresight.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in resource utilization, SLA violations, and scheduling speed in simulated cloud environments.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an innovative, efficient, and robust solution to dynamic cloud resource scaling challenges.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of rapid resource variation and highly
uncertain task loads in cloud computing environments. It proposes an
optimization method for elastic cloud resource scaling based on a multi-agent
system. The method deploys multiple autonomous agents to perceive resource
states in parallel and make local decisions. While maintaining the distributed
nature of the system, it introduces a collaborative value function to achieve
global coordination. This improves the responsiveness of resource scheduling
and enhances overall system performance. To strengthen system foresight, a
lightweight state prediction model is designed. It assists agents in
identifying future workload trends and optimizes the selection of scaling
actions. For policy training, the method adopts a centralized training and
decentralized execution reinforcement learning framework. This enables agents
to learn effectively and coordinate strategies under conditions of incomplete
information. The paper also constructs typical cloud scenarios, including
multi-tenancy and burst traffic, to evaluate the proposed method. The
evaluation focuses on resource isolation, service quality assurance, and
robustness. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent scaling
strategy outperforms existing methods in resource utilization, SLA violation
control, and scheduling latency. The results demonstrate strong adaptability
and intelligent regulation. This provides an efficient and reliable new
approach to solving the problem of elastic resource scaling in complex cloud

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynoStore, a system for managing data across different storage systems efficiently and resiliently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data distribution across facilities improves resource utilization, resiliency, and performance, but current systems struggle with heterogeneous protocols and lack unified coordination.

Method: DynoStore uses data containers as a standardized interface for storage systems, along with erasure coding for resilience and a load-balancing algorithm for efficient resource utilization.

Result: DynoStore improves performance by 10% over centralized systems and competes with state-of-the-art solutions like Redis and IPFS while offering superior fault tolerance.

Conclusion: DynoStore effectively addresses challenges in managing distributed data, ensuring efficiency, resilience, and fault tolerance across heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Data distribution across different facilities offers benefits such as
enhanced resource utilization, increased resilience through replication, and
improved performance by processing data near its source. However, managing such
data is challenging due to heterogeneous access protocols, disparate
authentication models, and the lack of a unified coordination framework. This
paper presents DynoStore, a system that manages data across heterogeneous
storage systems. At the core of DynoStore are data containers, an abstraction
that provides standardized interfaces for seamless data management,
irrespective of the underlying storage systems. Multiple data container
connections create a cohesive wide-area storage network, ensuring resilience
using erasure coding policies. Furthermore, a load-balancing algorithm ensures
equitable and efficient utilization of storage resources. We evaluate DynoStore
using benchmarks and real-world case studies, including the management of
medical and satellite data across geographically distributed environments. Our
results demonstrate a 10\% performance improvement compared to centralized
cloud-hosted systems while maintaining competitive performance with
state-of-the-art solutions such as Redis and IPFS. DynoStore also exhibits
superior fault tolerance, withstanding more failures than traditional systems.

### [74] [How Fast Can Graph Computations Go on Fine-grained Parallel Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00949)
*Yuqing Wang,Charles Colley,Brian Wheatman,Jiya Su,David F. Gleich,Andrew A. Chien*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates high-performance graph computing on the fine-grained UpDown architecture, showcasing improvements in PageRank and BFS performance by significant factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph algorithms demand high computational power, and current architectures lack efficient support for such operations. A co-designed architecture could address this gap.

Method: The authors designed the UpDown architecture optimized for fine-grained parallelism and irregular graph processing, running simulations on it for PageRank and BFS algorithms.

Result: The UpDown system demonstrated a performance exceeding the best known results—637K GTEPS for PageRank (5x improvement) and 989K GTEPS for BFS (100x improvement) on RMAT benchmark graphs.

Conclusion: Fine-grained architectures like UpDown significantly enhance graph computing, achieving high scalability and superior performance compared to traditional architectures.

Abstract: Large-scale graph problems are of critical and growing importance and
historically parallel architectures have provided little support. In the spirit
of co-design, we explore the question, How fast can graph computing go on a
fine-grained architecture? We explore the possibilities of an architecture
optimized for fine-grained parallelism, natural programming, and the
irregularity and skew found in real-world graphs. Using two graph benchmarks,
PageRank (PR) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), we evaluate a Fine-Grained Graph
architecture, UpDown, to explore what performance codesign can achieve. To
demonstrate programmability, we wrote five variants of these algorithms.
Simulations of up to 256 nodes (524,288 lanes) and projections to 16,384 nodes
(33M lanes) show the UpDown system can achieve 637K GTEPS PR and 989K GTEPS BFS
on RMAT, exceeding the best prior results by 5x and 100x respectively.

### [75] [Accelerating Loading WebGraphs in ParaGrapher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00716)
*Mohsen Koohi Esfahani*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ParaGrapher introduces optimizations PG-Fuse and CompBin for improved high-bandwidth storage utilization and decompression bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in ParaGrapher's handling of high-bandwidth storage and decompression tasks for graph processing.

Method: The authors developed PG-Fuse, a FUSE-based filesystem optimizing storage access, and CompBin, a binary representation for efficient graph compression and access.

Result: The optimizations achieved up to 7.6x speedup for storage utilization and up to 21.8x speedup for decompression bandwidth in tests across large-scale graphs.

Conclusion: PG-Fuse and CompBin effectively overcome key limitations in ParaGrapher, enhancing its performance for loading and processing large-scale graphs.

Abstract: ParaGrapher is a graph loading API and library that enables graph processing
frameworks to load large-scale compressed graphs with minimal overhead. This
capability accelerates the design and implementation of new high-performance
graph algorithms and their evaluation on a wide range of graphs and across
different frameworks. However, our previous study identified two major
limitations in ParaGrapher: inefficient utilization of high-bandwidth storage
and reduced decompression bandwidth due to increased compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we present two optimizations for ParaGrapher in this
paper. To improve storage utilization, particularly for high-bandwidth storage,
we introduce ParaGrapher-FUSE (PG-Fuse) a filesystem based on the FUSE
(Filesystem in User Space). PG-Fuse optimizes storage access by increasing the
size of requested blocks, reducing the number of calls to the underlying
filesystem, and caching the received blocks in memory for future calls. To
improve the decompression bandwidth, we introduce CompBin, a compact binary
representation of the CSR format. CompBin facilitates direct accesses to
neighbors while preventing storage usage for unused bytes. Our evaluation on 12
real-world and synthetic graphs with up to 128 billion edges shows that PG-Fuse
and CompBin achieve up to 7.6 and 21.8 times speedup, respectively.

### [76] [A Theory of Inference Compute Scaling: Reasoning through Directed Stochastic Skill Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00004)
*Austin R. Ellis-Mohr,Anuj K. Nayak,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS3, a framework for optimizing inference efficiency in large language models through a learned skill graph. It provides theoretical and empirical insights into balancing task performance, compute costs, and resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rising computational, financial, and energy costs of inference in large language models, which are becoming a significant burden as reasoning-focused tasks grow in prominence.

Method: The authors developed the Directed Stochastic Skill Search (DS3) framework, using stochastic traversal on a skill graph to model and analyze various inference strategies. They extended theoretical frameworks of LLM training to include inference and aligned it with empirical scaling behavior.

Result: The study recovers empirical observations, such as linear accuracy scaling with log compute, emergent reasoning behavior, and optimal inference strategies varying with task difficulty and model capability. These findings align with empirical patterns in current LLM operations.

Conclusion: By linking LLM training and inference, the DS3 framework provides deeper theoretical insights and practical tools for optimizing inference strategies, balancing task success, and resource efficiency in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic memory framework that addresses information spreading in Large Language Models (LLMs) through a mix of classical, holographic, and quantum-inspired techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models exhibit a problem of information spreading, which is reframed as an information-theoretic communication issue rather than a computational precision loss.

Method: The authors propose HDRAM, which uses hypertokens combining error-correcting codes, holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search to address memory operations in transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel.

Result: HDRAM enables efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space, enhancing associative information retrieval without changes to transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles in HDRAM successfully address the memory problem in transformers, improving their efficiency and robustness without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

*Eyhab Al-Masri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeutroSENSE, a framework integrating neutrosophic logic with machine learning to enhance accuracy, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification in intrusion detection for IoT systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve accuracy, explainability, and trust in intrusion detection mechanisms for IoT environments, where uncertainty and adaptability are crucial.

Method: NeutroSENSE integrates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic to decompose prediction confidence into truth, falsity, and indeterminacy. It flags high-indeterminacy predictions for review and uses thresholds to quantify uncertainty.

Result: NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy on the IoT-CAD dataset. Misclassified samples showed significantly higher indeterminacy scores compared to correct predictions, highlighting its effectiveness in uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: By incorporating neutrosophic logic, NeutroSENSE improves prediction accuracy, trustworthiness, and explainability, enabling targeted reviews valuable in edge-based IoT security systems.

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

### [80] [Examining Reject Relations in Stimulus Equivalence Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00265)
*Alexis Carrillo,Asieh Abolpour Mofrad,Anis Yazidi,Moises Betancort*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores the impact of reject relations on the formation of stimulus equivalence using FFNs, BERT, and GPT models in matching-to-sample simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the contentious role of reject relations in evaluating stimulus equivalence class formation using computational models.

Method: Researchers tested FFNs, BERT, and GPT in 18 matching-to-sample conditions with varying training structures, relation types, and negative comparison biases, comparing their performance to a probabilistic agent.

Result: Reject relations impacted agent performance, but the behavior observed in neural networks was comparable to simple associative learning, akin to the probabilistic agent.

Conclusion: Artificial neural networks may rely on associative mechanisms rather than true stimulus equivalence, highlighting the importance of stringent criteria when assessing equivalence in computational models.

Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE),
yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence
class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject
relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational
models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained
transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)
simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,
one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and
select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A
probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative
learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks
could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance
reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced
agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence
tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this
performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest
that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on
associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful
consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational
models of equivalence.

*Nathan Vaartjes,Vincent Francois-Lavet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper models elevator management as a Markov Decision Process and develops a Reinforcement Learning-based Elevator Group Control System to optimize travel times and energy consumption in large buildings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional elevator control methods struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial complexity inherent in dispatching, underscoring the need for a more adaptive system.

Method: They use a Reinforcement Learning approach with enhancements like a novel action space encoding, infra-step modeling for continuous arrivals, a tailored reward signal, and adjusted discount factors.

Result: The RL-based system outperformed a traditional rule-based algorithm, demonstrating adaptability to fluctuating traffic patterns and effectiveness in stochastic environments.

Conclusion: Reinforcement Learning can effectively address complex elevator dispatching challenges, providing better performance compared to heuristic methods in managing real-world traffic and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

### [82] [Towards Undistillable Models by Minimizing Conditional Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00012)
*Linfeng Ye,Shayan Mohajer Hamidi,En-hui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to create deep neural networks (DNNs) that are undistillable, preventing efficient knowledge distillation (KD) and protecting intellectual property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard intellectual property of DNNs by making them undistillable, ensuring students in KD processes cannot achieve better accuracy than independently trained models.

Method: A CMI minimized (CMIM) method, which trains DNNs by jointly minimizing cross entropy loss and conditional mutual information across temperature scaled clusters.

Result: Extensive experiments show CMIM-trained models are undistillable and outperform standard cross entropy-trained models in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: CMIM provides a reliable way to create undistillable DNNs, enhancing both security against KD attacks and predictive performance.

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

*Christiana Westlin,Ashutosh Singh,Deniz Erdogmus,Georgios Stratis,Lisa Feldman Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges traditional assumptions of fixed emotion-specific brain patterns, suggesting significant variability across individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question and test the widespread assumption that folk emotion categories represent fixed biological and psychological types.

Method: Reanalyzed data from a prior study with minimal structural assumptions, emphasizing variability in brain patterns across emotional instances.

Result: Observed significant variation in brain patterns across individuals, refuting the original study's findings of consistent mappings.

Conclusion: Scientific findings are shaped by underlying assumptions, and hypotheses should be validated through multiple methods to ensure reliability.

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

### [84] [ST-MTM: Masked Time Series Modeling with Seasonal-Trend Decomposition for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00013)
*Hyunwoo Seo,Chiehyeon Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-MTM, a masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition to enhance forecasting by disentangling temporal semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked time-series modeling (MTM) faces challenges when modeling semantic information due to intricate temporal variations and entanglement of time series components, often leading to learning spurious patterns.

Method: The authors propose ST-MTM, which employs seasonal-trend decomposition and novel masking strategies for seasonal and trend components. Seasonal components are masked using a period masking strategy, while trend components are masked using a sub-series masking strategy. The framework also incorporates a contrastive learning task to improve contextual consistency.

Result: ST-MTM demonstrated superior forecasting performance across experiments compared to current methods, including traditional MTM, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting techniques.

Conclusion: The ST-MTM framework effectively captures distinct temporal semantics, making it a robust solution for forecasting complex time-series data.

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

Motivation: To address the gap between static code-generation benchmarks and the dynamic, evolving nature of real-world software development.

Method: The SWE-Bench-CL benchmark organizes chronological GitHub issues, incorporates structural and contextual task analysis, and utilizes specialized metrics and an evaluation framework for agents with/without memory.

Result: SWE-Bench-CL demonstrated robust methodologies to evaluate agents against continual learning challenges in adaptive code-generation, enabling a deeper understanding of AI agents' performance.

Conclusion: SWE-Bench-CL offers a reproducible and comprehensive setup for advancing AI agents suited for dynamic software engineering environments, promoting adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on static

continuous stream of evolving issues, fixes, and feature requests. We introduce
SWE-Bench-CL, a novel continual learning benchmark built on the human-verified
SWE-Bench Verified dataset introduced by OpenAI and Princeton-NLP in 2024. By
organizing GitHub issues into chronologically ordered sequences that reflect
natural repository evolution, SWE-Bench-CL enables direct evaluation of an
agent's ability to accumulate experience, transfer knowledge across tasks, and
resist catastrophic forgetting. We complement the dataset with (i) a
preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual
sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented
with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized
continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting,
forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite
Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the
stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python
repositories. All code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based approach to improve Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by enabling a more adaptable and efficient generation of prior proposals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like Karhunen-Loève Expansion (KLE) rely on prior knowledge of covariance functions, which is often unavailable in practical scenarios. This motivates the search for data-driven solutions for Bayesian inverse problems.

Method: The authors applied a VAE framework to flexibly parameterize high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems, particularly targeting correlation structures in subsurface flow modeling.

Result: The VAE approach achieved accuracy comparable to KLE when correlation lengths were known and performed better when correlation length assumptions were incorrect. Additionally, it reduced stochastic dimensionality and improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The study concludes that deep generative models like VAEs can enhance McMC methods, making Bayesian inference more effective for complex, high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency
and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating
broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance
function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework
enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of
correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface
flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow
inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves
comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms
KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover,
the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving
computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative
models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional problems.

*Lu Zhang,Sangarapillai Lambotharan,Gan Zheng,Guisheng Liao,Xuekang Liu,Fabio Roli,Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to improve robustness against adversarial attacks in transformer-based modulation classification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformer models used for automatic modulation classification in IoT communication systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, necessitating improved defensive mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces a novel AdvI token within a ViT architecture to detect adversarial attacks. The method combines adversarial training and a detection mechanism into a single neural network model, reducing system complexity. Attention mechanisms are used to identify suspicious features in the input data.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to competitive methods in white-box attack scenarios, including fast gradient method, projected gradient descent, and basic iterative method attacks.

Conclusion: The AdvI token in ViT successfully enhances adversarial defense by influencing attention weights to detect anomalies, elegantly balancing training and running time defenses within a unified model.

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

*Tiexin Qin,Hong Yan,Haoliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA) to improve the generalization and adaptability of learned dynamics in unseen environments via Fourier space adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of current deep learning models in reliably predicting specific domains and generalizing unseen systems governed by similar dynamics but differing in environmental factors.

Method: The proposed method, FNSDA, uses Fourier mode partitioning to identify shared dynamics and adjusts modes for new environments by conditioning on low-dimensional latent parameters.

Result: FNSDA demonstrates superior or competitive generalization performance on four representative dynamic systems while significantly reducing parameter costs.

Conclusion: FNSDA offers an efficient and effective way to generalize dynamics modeling to unseen environments, leveraging Fourier space adaptation to achieve competitive results with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional

### [89] [Gradient-based Fine-Tuning through Pre-trained Model Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00016)
*Xuanbo Liu,Liu Liu,Fuxiang Wu,Fusheng Hao,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRFT, an efficient fine-tuning method for pre-trained models that updates select rows or columns of weight matrices, reducing parameter loads and surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models for specific tasks is computationally demanding and requires excessive storage.

Method: GRFT selectively updates rows or columns of the weight matrix based on the sum of squared gradients and incorporates regularization for better knowledge transfer.

Result: GRFT outperforms methods such as GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA, updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of parameters for FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed GRFT method enhances fine-tuning efficiency while achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

### [90] [Fractional Policy Gradients: Reinforcement Learning with Long-Term Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00073)
*Urvi Pawar,Kunal Telangi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning framework utilizing fractional calculus to address inefficiencies in standard policy gradients. FPG reduces variance and improves sample efficiency in policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of standard policy gradients, which rely on Markovian assumptions and suffer from high variance and sampling inefficiencies. The authors aim to integrate long-term temporal modeling into the policy optimization process.

Method: The authors reformulate policy gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives to establish long-range temporal correlations. They also develop a recursive computation method for fractional temporal-difference errors with efficient time and memory usage.

Result: Empirical tests show that FPG achieves 35-68% improvements in sample efficiency and reduces variance by 24-52% compared to leading baselines, while preserving convergence properties.

Conclusion: Fractional Policy Gradients offer a powerful mathematical framework for incorporating long-range dependencies in reinforcement learning without adding computational complexity, outperforming existing approaches in efficiency and variance reduction.

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning
framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in
policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from
Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By
reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes
power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an
efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference
errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows
FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus
standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation
demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction
versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically
grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational
overhead.

*Bo Wang,Qinyuan Cheng,Runyu Peng,Rong Bao,Peiji Li,Qipeng Guo,Linyang Li,Zhiyuan Zeng,Yunhua Zhou,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework connecting SFT and preference learning in LLM post-training, identifies limitations in conventional SFT, and proposes theoretical and practical solutions to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) during Large Language Model post-training and unify it with preference learning.

Method: Rigorous mathematical derivation to link SFT and preference learning, proposing a learning rate reduction technique and alternative SFT objectives based on f-divergence functions.

Result: Significant performance improvements: up to 25% relative gain and 6% absolute win rate increase in instruction-following tasks, along with theoretical validation of the extended relationship between logits and Q-functions.

Conclusion: Unified theoretical framework provides a deeper understanding of SFT and preference learning, enabling effective improvements in LLM post-training processes.

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which local updates outperform centralized methods under realistic data heterogeneity.

Method: A consensus-error-based analytical framework is developed, with bounds derived for convex, non-convex scenarios and extended to online federated learning.

Result: It identifies the bounded second-order heterogeneity assumption as crucial, and provides upper and lower bounds along with regret limits for online learning.

Conclusion: The framework clarifies advantages of Local SGD, offering insights for distributed optimization in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

*Minati Rath,Hema Date*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates three quantum-inspired data encoding strategies (ILS, GDS, and CCVS) to transform classical data into quantum format for classical machine learning, focusing on encoding efficiency and classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in converting classical data to quantum data while maintaining accurate representation and improving computational efficiency for machine learning applications.

Method: Three distinct strategies, ILS, GDS, and CCVS, are introduced and applied on classical datasets to assess their performance regarding encoding efficiency, correctness, and model accuracy.

Result: The encoding strategies were evaluated for their computational trade-offs, demonstrating varied impacts on encoding time, precision, and classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that optimizing quantum-inspired data encoding can enhance efficiency and predictive performance in classical machine learning models.

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

*Matthew Stephenson,Alex Newcombe,Eric Piette,Dennis Soemers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Optimistic-WS, a method to identify the best-performing algorithm for tasks in multi-problem domains more efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for algorithm selection in multi-task domains often suffer from inefficiencies and inaccuracies, necessitating improved techniques for agent evaluation.

Method: The authors model the problem as a multi-armed bandit framework and propose Optimistic-WS, which uses the Wilson score interval to rank algorithms by potential regret reduction.

Result: Optimistic-WS was tested on two popular game domains (GVGAI and Ludii) and showed significant performance improvements in reducing simple regret compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Optimistic-WS offers a promising and effective approach for enhancing algorithm selection and evaluation in multi-task domains, especially where high computation time is a factor.

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

*Kiyoung Om,Kyuil Sim,Taeyoung Yun,Hyeongyu Kang,Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing constrained high-dimensional black-box functions using a novel framework leveraging flow-based models and posterior inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional constrained optimization tasks are common yet difficult due to hard-to-find feasible regions, compounded by the failure of existing methods (e.g., Bayesian optimization) to overcome the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The proposed framework uses flow-based models for data distribution and surrogate models to predict outcomes with uncertainty quantification. It addresses multi-modality and plateaus during posterior inference by sampling in the smoother latent space of flow-based models.

Result: The method demonstrates superior empirical performance on synthetic and real-world black-box optimization tasks while mitigating common generative method issues like mode collapse.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective and scalable solution for constrained optimization, overcoming challenges of dimensionality, scalability, and mode collapse in the generative modeling approach.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints
is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.
These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to
hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have
been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a
promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from
poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the
target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new
framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.
First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and
surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations
with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection
problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising
candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.
During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly
multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when
constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate
this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the
latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data
space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.

### [96] [GANs Secretly Perform Approximate Bayesian Model Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00651)
*Maurizio Filippone,Marius P. Linhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new interpretation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as probabilistic generative models, which enables novel regularization and optimization strategies for improving their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs, despite their success in generative modeling, face challenges in optimization and are prone to overfitting, necessitating the development of better theoretical understanding and practical strategies for improvement.

Method: The authors interpret GANs as Bayesian neural networks with partial stochasticity, leveraging this view to frame GAN optimization as maximizing a proxy for marginal likelihood. They then use concepts like Occam's razor to devise regularization and optimization techniques aimed at flat minima and better generalization.

Result: The proposed strategies demonstrate performance improvements across a range of experiments, indicating their effectiveness in addressing GAN limitations.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel probabilistic perspective on GANs, enabling more effective regularization and optimization strategies, ultimately improving their generalization and performance.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

*Geng Zhang,Shenggan Cheng,Xuanlei Zhao,Ziming Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HelixPipe is a novel pipeline parallelism method addressing performance and memory challenges in long-sequence transformer training, achieving superior scalability and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipeline parallelisms for long sequence transformer training face limitations in performance due to quadratic attention computation and high memory usage.

Method: HelixPipe employs attention parallel partition for efficient pipeline scheduling, two-fold micro batch scheduling for memory balance and communication overlap, recomputation without attention, and chunked MLP to support longer sequences.

Result: HelixPipe shows improved throughput and scalability, achieving a 26% speedup over baseline methods during 7B model training with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs.

Conclusion: HelixPipe effectively enhances the training efficiency of transformer models for long sequences and demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in practical experiments.

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur
suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the
substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,
a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,
HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention
computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in
parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold
first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap
communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation
without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer
sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages
with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput
and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster
configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when
training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available

TL;DR: AIMatDesign is a reinforcement learning framework addressing challenges in machine learning-driven materials design by incorporating expert knowledge, enhancing model reliability, and leveraging innovative strategies for data augmentation and prediction refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of high-dimensional material composition space and limited experimental data, alongside overcoming reliability and knowledge integration issues in machine learning models.

Method: Introduced AIMatDesign using reinforcement learning with difference-based algorithms, trusted experimental data pools, LLM-guided prediction refinement, and knowledge-based reward functions.

Result: AIMatDesign achieved superior performance in discovery efficiency, convergence speed, success rates, and accurately predicted material properties, validated experimentally.

Conclusion: AIMatDesign demonstrates significant potential for accelerating and enhancing machine learning-driven materials discovery, ensuring reliable predictions and effective incorporation of expert knowledge.

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating
its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

*Arthur Thuy,Ekaterina Loginova,Dries F. Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study addresses limitations in Question Difficulty Estimation (QDE) and introduces a novel evaluation metric, DRPS, alongside a new model, OrderedLogitNN, which shows strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle shortcomings in QDE methods and evaluation metrics which disregard the ordinal nature of question difficulty and fail in addressing class imbalance.

Method: The paper benchmarks three modeling paradigms for QDE and introduces OrderedLogitNN, a new neural network model based on ordinal regression. Fine-tuning BERT was done on RACE++ and ARC datasets.

Result: OrderedLogitNN outperforms other methods on complex QDE tasks. Additionally, the balanced DRPS metric successfully accounts for both ordinality and class imbalance.

Conclusion: OrderedLogitNN and balanced DRPS set new standards for model design and evaluation in QDE tasks, offering a robust framework for future studies.

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

*Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Cong Wang,Wei-Bin Lee,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROSE (Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation), a new framework for adaptively assessing the safety of large language models (LLMs) using adversarial prompt generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate the safety of LLMs as they are widely used and face risks under adversarial prompting, highlighting limitations in static, manual safety benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose ROSE, leveraging multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for generating diverse and contextually relevant prompts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ROSE effectively uncovers safety vulnerabilities in LLMs, achieving improvements in evaluation metrics compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ROSE provides a more adaptive, practical, and context-aware benchmark for evaluating potential safety risks in LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper
contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiT-JEPA is a novel unified framework for urban trajectory representation, addressing challenges in capturing multi-scale trajectory details and semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing urban trajectory representation methods that fail to integrate fine-grained and high-level details effectively.

Method: HiT-JEPA utilizes a three-layer hierarchical architecture to capture point-level details, intermediate patterns, and high-level trajectory abstractions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that HiT-JEPA produces superior multi-scale trajectory representations, validated through trajectory similarity computation on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA successfully integrates detailed and abstract trajectory semantics, presenting a coherent framework for urban trajectory analysis.

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

*Wenbing Li,Zikai Song,Hang Zhou,Yunyao Zhang,Junqing Yu,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LoRA-Mixer, a lightweight modular framework combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance task-specific performance in adapting large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of combining LoRA with MoE for LLM adaptation face inefficiencies, such as using entire layers for switch experts or parallel expert branches, leading to reduced parameter efficiency and task fidelity.

Method: LoRA-Mixer replaces attention module projection matrices with task-specific LoRA experts, supports joint optimization via a hard-soft routing strategy or direct deployment of pretrained LoRA modules, and introduces Specialization Balance Loss (SBL) to improve task alignment and reuse experts under limited data.

Result: LoRA-Mixer demonstrates significant performance improvements over base models (up to 7.61%) and state-of-the-art methods (up to 1.68%) across seven benchmark datasets while using only 48% of the parameters.

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer offers an efficient and effective approach to adapt LLMs, showing strong benchmark performance and parameter efficiency, making it broadly compatible across different model architectures.

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,
SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of
LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer
achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base
models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer
achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,
using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong
performance.

TL;DR: This paper integrates contextual bandits with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively select action durations, achieving higher efficiency and performance in sequential decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL has been successful in decision-making tasks but lacks exploration of adaptive action durations for better flexibility and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method combines Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit to learn and select optimal action repetition rates based on state contexts.

Result: Experiments on Atari 2600 games showed significant performance improvements compared to static duration baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive temporal abstractions in DRL provide enhanced scalability and efficiency, particularly suitable for dynamic applications like gaming and robotics.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex
sequential decision-making tasks, such as playing Atari 2600 games and
mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the
temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates
contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing
policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep
Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal

*Chuan Li,Jiang You,Hassine Moungla,Vincent Gauthier,Miguel Nunez-del-Prado,Hugo Alatrista-Salas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of spatial sparsity in mobility flow forecasting by proposing a model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique, improving test MSE by up to 9.85%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for accurate human mobility modeling to better understand and mitigate epidemic spread, especially during public health crises such as COVID-19.

Method: The paper introduces the Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN) technique, which augments mobility features of a grid cell with aggregated signals from its immediate neighbors to address spatial sparsity.

Result: The experimental tests demonstrate that the SPN method improves forecasting accuracy across different time series models, with a reduction of up to 9.85% in test MSE.

Conclusion: Spatial smoothing via SPN provides a simple yet effective solution for robust spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly during public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic
spread and deploying timely interventions. In this work, we leverage a
large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital
Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast
mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial
sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits
the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we
propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)
technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its
immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting
backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input
lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting
performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings
demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple
yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public
health crises.

*Reece Bourisaw,Reid McCants,Jean-Marie Le Corre,Anna Iskhakova,Arsen S. Iskhakov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of predicting critical heat flux (CHF) in light-water reactors under varying axial heating conditions using curated datasets and model evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the prediction of CHF in light-water reactors, especially under spatially varying power profiles, and support the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark Phase II.

Method: The study compiled and digitized CHF datasets, validated them, and evaluated the performance of classical, tabular, and neural network methods for CHF prediction.

Result: Classical correlations and neural networks trained on uniform data were inadequate for non-uniform conditions, while tabular methods performed better but still had limitations.

Conclusion: Curated datasets and modeling baselines highlight the need for models that account for spatial power distributions, paving the way for advanced transfer-learning and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water
reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II
of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power
profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both
uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were
extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh,
validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats
for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating
and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular
methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network
trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to
generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models
that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these
curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork
for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification,
and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing complex-valued Hopfield neural networks have limited states, which restricts applications.

Method: Two CvHNNs are proposed, employing ceiling-type activation functions in rectangular and polar coordinate systems, along with phase and magnitude quantization.

Result: The models achieved higher state counts compared to prior CvHNN models, demonstrating improved capacity and functional range.

Conclusion: The novel CvHNNs successfully expand application possibilities by significantly increasing state numbers through phase and magnitude quantization.

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural

*Madison Cotteret,Christopher J. Kymn,Hugh Greatorex,Martin Ziegler,Elisabetta Chicca,Friedrich T. Sommer*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores improving the robustness and resolution of continuous attractor networks (CANs) in representing variables, using sparse grid-cell-like codes that overcome traditional CAN limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the stability-resolution trade-off in CANs caused by noise and imperfections in biological systems.

Method: Investigate sparse binary distributed codes with spatially-periodic receptive fields using random feature embeddings. Simulations and theoretical analysis validate the model.

Result: Grid-cell-like codes allow simultaneous high stability and resolution in CANs and extend capabilities to encode nonlinear manifolds and flexible computations.

Conclusion: The proposed model explains how the brain could robustly represent continuous variables and perform computations on complex manifolds with high resolution and robustness.

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain
temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent
activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory
mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or
heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has
shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor
states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the
resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability
and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe
for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome
this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature
embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We
demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes
enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously.
The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such
as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration
along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work
provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous
variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over
task-relevant manifolds.

### [110] [Estimating Correctness Without Oracles in LLM-Based Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00057)
*Thomas Valentin,Ardi Madadi,Gaetano Sapia,Marcel Böhme*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to measure incorrectness in LLM-generated code, called incoherence, which efficiently estimates error probabilities without the need for an oracle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are effective at generating code but often produce hallucinated, factually incorrect outputs. A method to quantify correctness without relying on existing correct implementations is needed.

Method: The authors introduce 'incoherence,' a measure of potential error in LLM-generated code. It provides a lower bound on errors and can detect incorrect outputs efficiently without using an oracle.

Result: The incoherence-based system identified about two-thirds of incorrect code programs in experiments and showed no false positives, effectively mimicking oracle evaluations.

Conclusion: Incoherence can reliably replace traditional oracle-based evaluations for ranking LLMs in code correctness, showing strong agreement with oracle-based rankings.

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most
successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:
LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually
incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can
we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,
that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a
lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program
for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an
extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our
incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of
incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based
evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.
In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by
the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of
LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

TL;DR: The paper compares Python binding tools (PyO3) for Rust with ctypes and cffi, focusing on performance and ease of use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python's slow interpreter and the difficulty of optimizing critical code sections call for effective binding tools for languages like Rust.

Method: The study conducts a comparative evaluation of PyO3, ctypes, and cffi based on performance and usability for Python-Rust integration.

Result: Rust tooling via PyO3 achieves state-of-the-art performance without needing concerns over API compatibility.

Conclusion: Using PyO3 provides a superior solution to optimize Python with Rust, overcoming traditional challenges with other binding methods.

Abstract: The Python programming language is best known for its syntax and scientific
libraries, but it is also notorious for its slow interpreter. Optimizing
critical sections in Python entails special knowledge of the binary
interactions between programming languages, and can be cumbersome to interface
manually, with implementers often resorting to convoluted third-party
libraries. This comparative study evaluates the performance and ease of use of
the PyO3 Python bindings toolchain for Rust against ctypes and cffi. By using
Rust tooling developed for Python, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance
with no concern for API compatibility.

TL;DR: The paper examines how programming languages, particularly object-oriented ones, underclassify functions, proposing new subclasses based on specific properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the lack of nuanced function classifications in programming languages and highlight opportunities for enhancement.

Method: Define subclasses of functions with unique properties and implement them experimentally across popular programming languages.

Result: Demonstrated potential benefits of introducing subclasses for functions in object-oriented programming contexts.

Conclusion: Introducing more detailed classifications for functions can enrich object-oriented programming capabilities and address current limitations.

Abstract: Compared to functions in mathematics, functions in programming languages seem
to be under classified. Functional programming languages based on the lambda
calculus famously treat functions as first-class values. Object-oriented
languages have adopted ``lambdas'', notably for call-back routines in
event-based programming. Typically a programming language has functions, a
function has a type, and some functions act on other functions and/or return
functions but there is generally a lack of (i) ``class Function'' in the OO
sense of the word class and particularly (ii) subclasses of Function for
functions having specific properties. Some such classes are presented here and
programmed in some popular programming languages as an experimental
investigation into OO languages missing this opportunity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces new metrics for evaluating 3D object detection systems, which account for latency and planning impact, essential for real-time autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for 3D object detection overlook trade-offs between speed and accuracy, hardware choices, and real-world impact like collision avoidance.

Method: The authors proposed Latency-aware AP (L-AP) and Planning-aware AP (P-AP) metrics, applied optimization techniques, and evaluated their model on the nuPlan dataset.

Result: Their proposed metrics improved real-time evaluation performance of 3D object detection systems and uncovered limitations in traditional assumptions regarding point cloud data.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes optimizing trade-offs between hardware, recognition, and latency for superior real-time autonomous driving systems by leveraging their new metrics.

Abstract: High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous
driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate
performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically
fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at
100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs
between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite
being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the
impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading
to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In
this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)
as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time
and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for
real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics
for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D
object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators.
We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object
detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our
metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the
more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for
real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our
metrics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework using conditional latent diffusion models to enhance autonomous driving algorithms' simulation-to-reality effectiveness, addressing challenges like domain adaptation, performance robustness, modularity, and real-time applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sim2real transfer in autonomous driving face major challenges such as domain adaptation, handling limited samples, modular processing of domain representations, and achieving real-time results.

Method: The framework uses conditional latent diffusion models with options for alternate foundation models, a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and prompts (text/image) to map across domains. It can generate diverse samples adapting to variables like weather, time, and conditions.

Result: Experiments show that the framework bridges the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%, demonstrated through a behavioral cloning case study for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Generative diffusion models have strong potential to address sim2real transfer gaps in autonomous driving, improving robustness and adaptability of algorithms for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Simulation-based design, optimization, and validation of autonomous driving
algorithms have proven to be crucial for their iterative improvement over the
years. Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful
transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real
transfer methods struggle to comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented
requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust
performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain
representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain
points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive
representations for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms using
conditional latent diffusion models. Our framework offers options to leverage:
(i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and
(iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and
target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples
when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather
conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze
the presented framework and report our findings in the form of critical
quantitative metrics and ablation studies, as well as insightful qualitative
examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of the
proposed approach in bridging the sim2real gap for end-to-end autonomous
driving using a behavioral cloning case study. Our experiments indicate that
the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by
over 40%. We hope that our approach underscores the potential of generative
diffusion models in sim2real transfer, offering a pathway toward more robust
and adaptive autonomous driving.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel DRL framework designed to address action execution mismatches in real-world applications by introducing a two-stage decision-making process and considering control errors during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DRL approaches assume perfect action execution, ignoring real-world uncertainties caused by system dynamics, hardware limitations, and latency, which degrade performance in applications like robotics.

Method: The framework explicitly incorporates action execution mismatches into the agent's training process using a two-stage approach where agents determine desired actions and select corresponding control signals to mitigate execution errors.

Result: The framework improves robustness across multiple mechanical simulation environments, demonstrating resistance to real-world uncertainties and applicability to control-oriented engineering tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges the gap between idealized DRL models and real-world implementations, offering a robust tool for engineering applications where adaptability to execution mismatches is critical.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an RL system for a humanoid robot called BRUCE, which accurately simulates complex parallel mechanisms for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning frameworks often exclude mechanical intelligence in parallel actuation mechanisms because simulator support for closed chains is limited, leading to inaccuracies.

Method: An end-to-end curriculum RL framework using GPU-accelerated MJX simulator ensures accurate closed-chain simulation for BRUCE's leg mechanisms.

Result: The RL approach outperforms a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) in generalization and zero-shot real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Fully simulating parallel mechanisms in humanoid RL pipelines leads to significant performance and computational advantages.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled significant advances in humanoid
robot locomotion, yet most learning frameworks do not account for mechanical
intelligence embedded in parallel actuation mechanisms due to limitations in
simulator support for closed kinematic chains. This omission can lead to
inaccurate motion modeling and suboptimal policies, particularly for robots
with high actuation complexity. This paper presents an end-to-end curriculum RL
framework for BRUCE, a kid-sized humanoid robot featuring three distinct
parallel mechanisms in its legs: a differential pulley, a 5-bar linkage, and a
4-bar linkage. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simplified serial
approximations, we simulate all closed-chain constraints natively using
GPU-accelerated MJX (MuJoCo), preserving the hardware's physical properties
during training. We benchmark our RL approach against a Model Predictive
Controller (MPC), demonstrating better surface generalization and performance
in real-world zero-shot deployment. This work highlights the computational
approaches and performance benefits of fully simulating parallel mechanisms in
end-to-end learning pipelines for legged humanoids.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in existing lidar and camera-based localization solutions, such as poor performance in visually obscured environments, high costs, and computational overhead. It leverages mmWave radar, which is cost-effective and performs well regardless of visibility.

Method: The proposed method, RaGNNarok, utilizes a graph neural network to enhance radar point cloud data. It achieves real-time performance with low computational requirements, running efficiently on low-cost devices like the Raspberry Pi 5.

Result: The framework is evaluated for localization, SLAM, and autonomous navigation tasks in three environments. Results show that RaGNNarok achieves strong reliability and generalizability.

Conclusion: RaGNNarok is presented as a robust, efficient, and low-cost solution for real-time radar-based localization, suitable for indoor mobile robots.

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

research. Our framework leverages a mix of physics-based and data-driven
techniques for developing and simulating digital twins of autonomous vehicles
and their operating environments. It is capable of reconstructing real-world

our framework can reconstruct 3D scenes and assets with up to 97% structural
similarity, while maintaining frame rates above 60 Hz. We also demonstrate that
it can handle natural language prompts to generate diverse driving scenarios

*Tao Lin,Gen Li,Yilei Zhong,Yanwen Zou,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel module to enhance Vision-Language-Action models by integrating 3D geometry features without needing explicit depth sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models lack precise spatial understanding due to being primarily trained on 2D image-text pairs, which limits their applications in complex real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce a plug-and-play module that implicitly integrates 3D geometry features into VLA models, using off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation models.

Result: The module significantly improves performance in spatially complex tasks across diverse scenarios, as verified through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances the spatial understanding capabilities of VLA models, bridging the gap between semantic and geometric understanding without additional hardware requirements.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for
enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the
real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text
pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding
capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D
supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated
explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates
additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work
introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features
into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation
models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial
understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive
evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

*Yi Ru Wang,Carter Ung,Grant Tannert,Jiafei Duan,Josephine Li,Amy Le,Rishabh Oswal,Markus Grotz,Wilbert Pumacay,Yuquan Deng,Ranjay Krishna,Dieter Fox,Siddhartha Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboEval is a new benchmark for assessing bimanual robotic policies, offering detailed task metrics to uncover weaknesses often masked by binary success results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking methods in robotic manipulation lack the ability to pinpoint specific policy failures, such as coordination flaws or asymmetric arm usage.

Method: RoboEval introduces semantically tiered tasks with diagnostic metrics, supported by human demonstrations for training, to systematically evaluate weaknesses in policies.

Result: Experiments show policies with similar success rates may fail differently. Behavioral metrics are found to be informative and correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs.

Conclusion: RoboEval provides a more actionable way to understand robot manipulation failures, emphasizing the importance of evaluation systems beyond binary task success metrics.

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a

framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIJE, an algorithm for real-time image Jacobian estimation capable of self-recognition and visual servoing on musculoskeletal robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robots to robustly understand and adapt to their body states and tools for real-world applications without requiring markers or structural knowledge.

Method: Developed DIJE, utilizing optical flow and a simplified Kalman Filter for whole-image processing. Applied DIJE to achieve self-recognition and create a visual servoing controller.

Result: Successfully implemented DIJE on a musculoskeletal robot, demonstrating robust self-recognition and effective tool control.

Conclusion: DIJE offers a promising framework for global visuomotor policy estimation, potentially advancing manipulation capabilities in robotics.

Abstract: For robots to move in the real world, they must first correctly understand
the state of its own body and the tools that it holds. In this research, we
propose DIJE, an algorithm to estimate the image Jacobian for every pixel. It
is based on an optical flow calculation and a simplified Kalman Filter that can
be efficiently run on the whole image in real time. It does not rely on markers
nor knowledge of the robotic structure. We use the DIJE in a self-recognition
process which can robustly distinguish between movement by the robot and by
external entities, even when the motion overlaps. We also propose a visual
servoing controller based on DIJE, which can learn to control the robot's body
to conduct reaching movements or bimanual tool-tip control. The proposed
algorithms were implemented on a physical musculoskeletal robot and its
performance was verified. We believe that such global estimation of the
visuomotor policy has the potential to be extended into a more general
framework for manipulation.

Motivation: To design a compact, high-resolution, and mechanically simple tension sensor suitable for robotic and prosthetic systems.

Method: Developed a tension sensor featuring a symmetric elastomer structure designed using Timoshenko beam theory and FEM analysis. It uses a compact photo-reflector (VCNT2020) with a 16-bit ADC and CAN-FD communication for precise force measurement and signal acquisition.

Result: The sensor achieved a resolution of 9.9 mN and a low RMSE of 0.455 N during calibration experiments, with force control experiments yielding even lower RMSEs of 0.073 N. Additionally, it showed over a tenfold improvement in resolution compared to prior designs using photo-interrupters.

Conclusion: The proposed sensor combines high resolution, reduced nonlinearity and hysteresis, and easy mechanical integration, making it highly suitable for robotic and prosthetic systems requiring precise force feedback.

Abstract: This paper presents a miniature tension sensor using a photo-reflector,
designed for compact tendon-driven grippers and robotic hands. The proposed
sensor has a small form factor of 13~mm x 7~mm x 6.5~mm and is capable of
measuring tensile forces up to 200~N. A symmetric elastomer structure
incorporating fillets and flexure hinges is designed based on Timoshenko beam
theory and verified via FEM analysis, enabling improved sensitivity and
mechanical durability while minimizing torsional deformation. The sensor
utilizes a compact photo-reflector (VCNT2020) to measure displacement in the
near-field region, eliminating the need for light-absorbing materials or
geometric modifications required in photo-interrupter-based designs. A 16-bit
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and CAN-FD (Flexible Data-rate) communication
enable efficient signal acquisition with up to 5~kHz sampling rate. Calibration
experiments demonstrate a resolution of 9.9~mN (corresponding to over 14-bit
accuracy) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.455~N. Force control
experiments using a twisted string actuator and PI control yield RMSEs as low
as 0.073~N. Compared to previous research using photo-interrupter, the proposed
method achieves more than tenfold improvement in resolution while also reducing
nonlinearity and hysteresis. The design is mechanically simple, lightweight,
easy to assemble, and suitable for integration into robotic and prosthetic
systems requiring high-resolution force feedback.

*Jiajie Zhang,Shenrui Wu,Xu Ma,Sören Schwertfeger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated system for converting architectural CAD files into a hierarchical topometric OpenStreetMap representation for robust indoor robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLAM-based map generation is inefficient and prone to failures in dynamic, large-scale indoor environments, highlighting the need for more robust mapping solutions.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-stage pipeline that processes CAD files to create hierarchical topometric maps, leveraging AreaGraph-based segmentation and semantic labeling to produce navigable, unified building layouts.

Result: The system generates semantically rich, topologically correct maps for robots, avoiding SLAM's limitations. It simplifies deployment in large and dynamic indoor environments.

Conclusion: This CAD-based mapping system provides a scalable and robust solution for robot navigation in indoor spaces, bypassing SLAM-related inefficiencies while offering practical usability through a GUI.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous mobile robots is predicated on the availability
of environmental maps, yet conventional generation via SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping) suffers from significant limitations in time, labor,
and robustness, particularly in dynamic, large-scale indoor environments where
map obsolescence can lead to critical localization failures. To address these
challenges, this paper presents a complete and automated system for converting
architectural Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files into a hierarchical topometric
OpenStreetMap (OSM) representation, tailored for robust life-long robot
navigation. Our core methodology involves a multi-stage pipeline that first
isolates key structural layers from the raw CAD data and then employs an
AreaGraph-based topological segmentation to partition the building layout into
a hierarchical graph of navigable spaces. This process yields a comprehensive
and semantically rich map, further enhanced by automatically associating
textual labels from the CAD source and cohesively merging multiple building
floors into a unified, topologically-correct model. By leveraging the permanent
structural information inherent in CAD files, our system circumvents the
inefficiencies and fragility of SLAM, offering a practical and scalable
solution for deploying robots in complex indoor spaces. The software is
encapsulated within an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate
practical use. The code and dataset are available at

*Tinghe Hong,Shenlin Cai,Boyang Li,Kai Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for improved eye localization and tracking in ophthalmic surgical robots, addressing limitations in current systems and achieving high precision in eye orientation estimation and robotic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ophthalmic surgical robots enhance precision and stability during surgeries by minimizing hand tremors. However, manual preoperative navigation introduces inconsistency and uncertainty. Current gaze estimation methods face issues like occlusion, reliance on additional sensors, and facial detection dependency.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid approach combining machine learning and traditional algorithms for eye localization and tracking. This technique avoids the need for landmarks and provides stable detection under various lighting and shadow conditions.

Result: Experiments demonstrated high accuracy, with an average error of 0.58 degrees in eye orientation estimation and 2.08 degrees in robotic arm control based on the estimated orientation.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology successfully overcomes existing gaze estimation challenges, offering improved reliability and accuracy for ophthalmic surgical robots' preoperative navigation.

Abstract: Ophthalmic surgical robots offer superior stability and precision by reducing
the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in
confined surgical spaces. Despite the advancements in developing vision- and
force-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation
remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and
increasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the
surgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including
dependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,
and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this
study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines
machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of
landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under
varying lighting and shadow conditions. Extensive real-world experiment results
show that our proposed method has an average estimation error of 0.58 degrees
for eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree average control error for the
robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

*Rohit Kumar,Melya Boukheddimi,Dennis Mronga,Shivesh Kumar,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-design approach that incorporates parallel coupling constraints for robot design and behavior optimization, leading to enhanced payload capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of separating structural design and behavior optimization in robotics and address the neglect of parallel mechanisms in existing co-design methods.

Method: The framework includes an outer optimization loop for design parameters (transmission ratios) and an inner loop for trajectory optimization in actuation space, explicitly considering parallel coupling constraints.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves the dynamic payload capacity compared to traditional co-design approaches using simplified tree-type models.

Conclusion: Incorporating parallel coupling constraints into co-design frameworks provides a more effective optimization of robot design and behavior, enhancing performance in specific tasks.

Abstract: In robotics, structural design and behavior optimization have long been
considered separate processes, resulting in the development of systems with
limited capabilities. Recently, co-design methods have gained popularity, where
bi-level formulations are used to simultaneously optimize the robot design and
behavior for specific tasks. However, most implementations assume a serial or
tree-type model of the robot, overlooking the fact that many robot platforms
incorporate parallel mechanisms. In this paper, we present a novel co-design
approach that explicitly incorporates parallel coupling constraints into the
dynamic model of the robot. In this framework, an outer optimization loop
focuses on the design parameters, in our case the transmission ratios of a
parallel belt-driven manipulator, which map the desired torques from the joint
space to the actuation space. An inner loop performs trajectory optimization in
the actuation space, thus exploiting the entire dynamic range of the
manipulator. We compare the proposed method with a conventional co-design
approach based on a simplified tree-type model. By taking advantage of the
actuation space representation, our approach leads to a significant increase in
dynamic payload capacity compared to the conventional co-design implementation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for legged robots to imitate animal-like movements using real-world animal motion data, ensuring user control over robot behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance legged robot locomotion by leveraging animal motion data for adaptive and stylistically coherent movement patterns.

Method: The framework uses constrained inverse kinematics and model predictive control to convert animal motion data for robots, applies a variational autoencoder for motion synthesis, and employs reinforcement learning for physical robot control.

Result: The approach enables quadruped robots to switch between gaits adaptively, execute user velocity commands accurately, and maintain stylistic similarity to animal motion.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully blends animal-inspired locomotion patterns with user-guided commands, enabling reliable and accurate motion imitation by legged robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework for legged robots that leverages
unstructured real-world animal motion data to generate animal-like and
user-steerable behaviors. Our framework learns to follow velocity commands
while reproducing the diverse gait patterns in the original dataset. To begin
with, animal motion data is transformed into a robot-compatible database using
constrained inverse kinematics and model predictive control, bridging the
morphological and physical gap between the animal and the robot. Subsequently,
a variational autoencoder-based motion synthesis module captures the diverse
locomotion patterns in the motion database and generates smooth transitions
between them in response to velocity commands. The resulting kinematic motions
serve as references for a reinforcement learning-based feedback controller
deployed on physical robots. We show that this approach enables a quadruped
robot to adaptively switch gaits and accurately track user velocity commands
while maintaining the stylistic coherence of the motion data. Additionally, we
provide component-wise evaluations to analyze the system's behavior in depth
and demonstrate the efficacy of our method for more accurate and reliable
motion imitation.

TL;DR: The paper presents the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN), a method combining physical and data-driven modeling to improve quadrotor dynamics modeling under unknown conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrotors require accurate dynamics modeling for precise trajectory tracking, but current methods struggle in unknown environments with variable payloads and disturbances.

Method: PI-WAN integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and a physics-informed loss function to enhance model robustness and generalization.

Result: PI-WAN achieves better prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness than baseline methods in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: This approach successfully combines data-driven and physics-informed methods, proving effective in improving quadrotor dynamics modeling under diverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of datasets and simulation benchmarks specific to dual-arm and dexterous hands limits progress in humanoid robot manipulation research. Autonomous data collection for these complex tasks remains a significant hurdle.

Method: The framework combines atomic dexterous operations, spatial annotations for objects and humanoid hands, reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and Monte Carlo tree search techniques to generate spatial constraints and improve planning for long-horizon tasks.

Result: A novel benchmark with augmented scenarios was introduced to evaluate collected data, showing improvement in performance scalability of 2D and 3D diffusion policies when applied to the dataset.

Conclusion: HumanoidGen successfully addresses gaps in humanoid robot manipulation benchmarks by demonstrating scalable and high-quality data collection capabilities, advancing the development of dexterous bimanual robotic tasks.

Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation
benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid
robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and
high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous
manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm
movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safe and efficient outdoor robot navigation by enabling adaptive terrain assessment, without the reliance on extensively labeled datasets.

Method: A variational autoencoder processes elevation and texture data. Initial teleoperation collects navigation experiences, which are encoded, clustered using BIRCH, and used to assess real-time terrain traversability.

Result: The method generalizes across robots and surfaces, adapts dynamically, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic benchmarks and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The novel traversability estimation approach provides efficient, robust, and adaptable navigation for robots, demonstrating extensive utility in diverse environments.

Abstract: Accurate traversability estimation is essential for safe and effective
navigation of outdoor robots operating in complex environments. This paper
introduces a novel experience-based method that allows robots to autonomously
learn which terrains are traversable based on prior navigation experience,
without relying on extensive pre-labeled datasets. The approach integrates
elevation and texture data into multi-layered grid maps, which are processed
using a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on a generic texture dataset.
During an initial teleoperated phase, the robot collects sensory data while
moving around the environment. These experiences are encoded into compact
feature vectors and clustered using the BIRCH algorithm to represent
traversable terrain areas efficiently. In deployment, the robot compares new
terrain patches to its learned feature clusters to assess traversability in
real time. The proposed method does not require training with data from the
targeted scenarios, generalizes across diverse surfaces and platforms, and
dynamically adapts as new terrains are encountered. Extensive evaluations on
both synthetic benchmarks and real-world scenarios with wheeled and legged
robots demonstrate its effectiveness, robustness, and superior adaptability
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: The survey provides insights into the complementary roles of physical simulators and world models in achieving robust embodied AI and explores their impact on simulation-to-reality transfer.

Conclusion: This paper synthesizes current progress to clarify the path toward generalizable embodied AI systems and identifies open challenges in the area.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied
intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence
focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the

simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest.
Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training
and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of
complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal
representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and
adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey
systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the
integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their
complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in
intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and
internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world
deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges,
this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more

(micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls
them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an
18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt
yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity
scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the

Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding

Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim
to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business

### [135] [An AST-guided LLM Approach for SVRF Code Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00352)
*Abanoub E. Abdelmalak,Mohamed A. Elsayed,David Abercrombie,Ilhami Torunoglu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid method combining AST embedding and RAG to improve SVRF code generation, achieving up to a 40% enhancement in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of SVRF development in semiconductor applications has grown due to advancing nodes and intricate design rules, highlighting gaps in traditional methods and expertise.

Method: The authors integrate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), validate code generation structurally, and propose a new scoring framework tailored to SVRF.

Result: The new methodology, tested on 740 DRC rules, improved code generation accuracy by up to 40% compared to conventional text-based fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This approach efficiently bridges expertise gaps, optimizes SVRF code synthesis, reduces errors, and accelerates design cycles, leading to improved productivity.

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor
applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes
create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development
ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel
methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring
semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with
domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific
scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In
our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses
relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our
methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy
compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry
expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development
under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and
efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through
design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve
overall productivity.

*Xikai Sun,Fan Dang,Kebin Liu,Xin Miao,Zihao Yang,Haimo Lu,Yawen Zheng,Yunhao Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces iPanda, a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to fully automate protocol conformance testing, improving test efficiency and performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional protocol conformance testing is labor-intensive, involving manual creation of many test cases and scripts. The authors aim to automate this process by utilizing the advanced capabilities of LLMs for text and code generation.

Method: iPanda employs a keyword-based method to generate test cases, uses code retrieval-augmented generation to create executable test scripts, and features an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine these scripts. It then executes the tests to verify protocol compliance.

Result: Experiments with various protocols showed that iPanda outperformed traditional LLM-based approaches, boosting the success rate of test-code generation by factors ranging from 4.675 to 10.751 times.

Conclusion: iPanda demonstrates significant efficiency and accuracy improvements in protocol conformance testing by leveraging LLMs for automation, potentially setting a new standard in the field.

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations
comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches
involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process
labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities,
providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose
iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol
conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its
implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically
generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based
retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the
implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code
quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine
generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the
generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between
implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on
various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based
approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by
factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

### [137] [Recommending Variable Names for Extract Local Variable Refactorings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00413)
*Taiming Wang,Hui Liu,Yuxia Zhang,Yanjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces VarNamer, a tool to recommend better variable names during extract local variable refactoring. It outperforms existing IDE recommendations and speeds up development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IDE-recommended variable names during extract local variable refactoring often differ from developer preferences, creating inefficiency and additional renaming tasks.

Method: They conducted a large-scale empirical study, identified useful naming contexts, developed heuristic rules using static analysis and data mining techniques, and incorporated some rules into IDEs like Eclipse.

Result: VarNamer improved exact matches by 52.6% over Eclipse and by 40.7% over IntelliJ, demonstrated generalizability across programming languages like C++, and reduced 49.3% edits in refactoring during a user study.

Conclusion: The proposed VarNamer approach greatly enhances variable naming accuracy, speeds up refactoring processes, and has the potential to generalize across different programming languages.

Abstract: Extract local variable is one of the most popular refactorings, and most IDEs
and refactoring tools provide automated support for this refactoring. However,
we find approximately 70% of the names recommended by these IDEs are different
from what developers manually constructed, adding additional renaming burdens
to developers and providing limited assistance. In this paper, we introduce
VarNamer, an automated approach designed to recommend variable names for
extract local variable refactorings. Through a large-scale empirical study, we
identify key contexts that are useful for composing variable names. Leveraging
these insights, we developed a set of heuristic rules through program static
analysis techniques and employ data mining techniques to recommend variable
names effectively. Notably, some of our heuristic rules have been successfully
integrated into Eclipse, where they are now distributed with the latest
releases of the IDE. Evaluation demonstrates its superiority over
state-of-the-art IDEs. Specifically, VarNamer significantly increases the
chance of exact match by 52.6% compared to Eclipse and 40.7% compared to
IntelliJ IDEA. We also evaluated the proposed approach with real-world extract
local variable refactorings conducted in C++ projects, and the results suggest
that the approach can achieve comparable performance on programming languages
besides Java. It may suggest the generalizability of VarNamer. Finally, we
designed and conducted a user study and the results of the user study suggest
that our approach can speed up the refactoring by 27.8% and reduce 49.3% edits
on the recommended variable names.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how HEXACO personality traits, gender, and age distributions impact teamwork quality in software engineering teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing recognition that human factors, especially personality traits, significantly influence teamwork quality in software development.

Method: The study collected preliminary data from 54 participants to measure how HEXACO personality traits and other factors like gender and age affect teamwork quality.

Result: Analysis revealed that personality traits, gender composition, and age distribution significantly influence the quality of teamwork.

Conclusion: Initial findings validate the study's design and highlight areas where IT organizations can enhance teamwork, offering directions for further research.

Abstract: Although software engineering research has focused on optimizing processes
and technology, there is a growing recognition that human factors, particularly
teamwork, also significantly impact optimization. Recent research suggests that
developer personality has a strong influence on teamwork. In fact, personality
considerations may have a greater impact on software development than processes
and tools. This paper aims to design a study that measures the impact of HEXACO
personality traits on the Teamwork Quality (TWQ) of software teams. A
preliminary data collection (n=54) was conducted for this purpose. The analysis
showed that several personality traits, as well as their composition, had a
significant impact on TWQ. Additionally, other variables, such as the
proportion of women and age distribution, also affected TWQ. The study's
initial results demonstrate the usefulness and validity of the study design.
The results also suggest several opportunities to improve teamwork in IT
organizations and avenues for further research.

TL;DR: The paper reviews current methods in coverage-guided testing (CGT) for deep learning models, presents detailed taxonomies, and highlights open research challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are increasingly used in safety-critical domains, raising the need for robust quality assurance methods like coverage-guided testing.

Method: A comprehensive review of state-of-the-art CGT methods, organizing them into taxonomies, analyzing evaluation practices, and identifying gaps in research.

Result: The paper categorizes CGT methods based on characteristics and application scenarios and discusses evaluation practices, challenges, and research trends.

Conclusion: The paper provides a roadmap for advancing research and practical implementations of CGT in deep learning model quality assurance, emphasizing the importance of standardization and generalizability.

Abstract: As Deep Learning (DL) models are increasingly applied in safety-critical
domains, ensuring their quality has emerged as a pressing challenge in modern
software engineering. Among emerging validation paradigms, coverage-guided
testing (CGT) has gained prominence as a systematic framework for identifying
erroneous or unexpected model behaviors. Despite growing research attention,
existing CGT studies remain methodologically fragmented, limiting the
understanding of current advances and emerging trends. This work addresses that
gap through a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art CGT methods for DL
models, including test coverage analysis, coverage-guided test input
generation, and coverage-guided test input optimization. This work provides
detailed taxonomies to organize these methods based on methodological
characteristics and application scenarios. We also investigate evaluation
practices adopted in existing studies, including the use of benchmark datasets,
model architectures, and evaluation aspects. Finally, open challenges and
future directions are highlighted in terms of the correlation between
structural coverage and testing objectives, method generalizability across
tasks and models, practical deployment concerns, and the need for standardized
evaluation and tool support. This work aims to provide a roadmap for future
academic research and engineering practice in DL model quality assurance.

*Ronny Seiger,Daniel Locher,Marco Kaufmann,Aaron F. Kurz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Radiant, a domain-specific language for transforming low-level IoT sensor data into higher-level business process events, using complex event processing (CEP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deriving meaningful business process insights from fine-grained IoT sensor data, which current systems lack.

Method: The researchers created a domain-specific language, Radiant, for specifying patterns in sensor data. These patterns translate into CEP applications, allowing real-time activity detection from IoT sensor streams.

Result: They evaluated the proposed system in smart manufacturing and smart healthcare scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting activity executions and providing guidance on activity detection quality.

Conclusion: Radiant empowers domain experts to bridge the gap between IoT sensor data and business process analysis, with proven benefits in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems are equipped with a plethora of
sensors providing real-time data about the current operations of their
components, which is crucial for the systems' internal control systems and
processes. However, these data are often too fine-grained to derive useful
insights into the execution of the larger processes an IoT system might be part
of. Process mining has developed advanced approaches for the analysis of
business processes that may also be used in the context of IoT. Bringing
process mining to IoT requires an event abstraction step to lift the low-level
sensor data to the business process level. In this work, we aim to empower
domain experts to perform this step using a newly developed domain-specific
language (DSL) called Radiant. Radiant supports the specification of patterns
within the sensor data that indicate the execution of higher level process
activities. These patterns are translated to complex event processing (CEP)
applications to be used for detecting activity executions at runtime. We
propose a corresponding software architecture for online event abstraction from
IoT sensor streams using the CEP applications. We evaluate these applications
to monitor activity executions using IoT sensors in smart manufacturing and
smart healthcare. The evaluation method and results inform the domain expert
about the quality of activity detections and potential for improvement.

*Guoliang Duan,Mingwei Liu,Yanlin Wang,Chong Wang,Xin Peng,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models' ability to generate code following complex programming instructions is evaluated using MultiCodeIF, a benchmark covering multiple dimensions, types of tasks, and feedback-driven iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks focusing on both functional and non-functional programming requirements for assessing LLMs under real-world development constraints.

Method: The researchers developed MultiCodeIF, a benchmark built on a structured taxonomy with 9 categories and 27 constraint types, utilizing an automated pipeline, ConstraGen, to create and evolve code tasks from 14 programming languages.

Result: Performance evaluation of six LLMs showed significant disparities in constraint satisfaction rates, with top-performing models performing better on single-level tasks compared to multi-level hierarchical scenarios.

Conclusion: MultiCodeIF enables a nuanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs, demonstrating the need for iterative feedback and multi-dimensional benchmarks to bridge synthetic and real-world code generation scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in code generation,
yet their ability to follow complex programming instructions with layered and
diverse constraints remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often prioritize
functional correctness, overlooking the nuanced requirements found in
real-world development. We introduce MultiCodeIF, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate instruction-following in code generation across multiple
dimensions: constraint type, hierarchical levels, and iterative refinement.
Built upon a structured taxonomy of 9 categories and 27 constraint types,
MultiCodeIF enables granular assessment of both functional and non-functional
instruction adherence. Using an automated pipeline, ConstraGen, we synthesize
and evolve 2,021 code tasks sourced from 14 programming languages, supporting
multi-turn evaluation through feedback-driven task variants. Empirical
evaluation of six state-of-the-art LLMs uncovers substantial performance
disparities. The top-performing model, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, achieves 63.0%
average constraint satisfaction, while smaller models like Qwen3-1.7B fall to
44.8%. Models perform well on explicit constraints, but struggle with implicit
or abstract constraints. Tasks with multiple hierarchical constraints
significantly reduce model success rates, from 54.5% in single-level to just
18.8% in multi-level scenarios. However, structured feedback enables
progressive improvement: average constraint satisfaction rises from 63.0% to
83.4% over four iterative refinement rounds. MultiCodeIF provides a scalable,
constraint-aware, and feedback-sensitive framework to benchmark LLMs under
realistic code generation scenarios, bridging the gap between synthetic
evaluations and real-world instruction complexity. The full benchmark dataset,
evaluation pipeline, and source code are available at

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the Snap packaging system highlighting concerns about bloated package sizes and infrequent updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns and criticisms around Snap packaging, aiming to assess its efficiency and impact on software delivery.

Method: The study involves empirical observations regarding the size and updating frequencies of Snap packages.

Result: Snap packages are shown to be bloated and less frequently updated compared to expectations.

Conclusion: Snap packaging needs improvement in areas of package efficiency and update frequency, contributing to broader software packaging research.

Abstract: Snap is an alternative software packaging system developed by Canonical and
provided by default in the Ubuntu Linux distribution. Given the heterogeneity
of various Linux distributions and their various releases, Snap allows an
interoperable delivery of software directly to users. However, concerns and
criticism have also been frequently expressed. Regarding this criticism, the
paper shows that currently distributed snap packages are indeed on average
bloated in terms of their sizes and outdated in terms updating frequencies.
With these empirical observations, this short paper contributes to the research
domain of software packaging, software packages, and package managers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the impact of AI assistants on software maintainability through a controlled experiment, finding modest speedups, improved CodeHealth for habitual AI users, and no significant signs of degraded maintainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the influence AI assistants like GitHub Copilot have on software maintainability, given the growing automation in software engineering but limited understanding of its longer-term impact on evolving code.

Method: The researchers conducted a two-phase experiment with 151 participants involving new feature addition and subsequent code evolution, comparing outcomes with and without AI assistance.

Result: AI assistance led to a 30.7% median task completion time reduction, with a 55.9% speedup for habitual users. CodeHealth slightly improved and showed statistically significant improvement for habitual AI users, but overall, maintainability did not significantly degrade.

Conclusion: AI assistants effectively accelerate development and enhance CodeHealth for frequent users without harming maintainability. Future studies should focus on potential risks like code bloat and cognitive debt.

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming
software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity
improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.
[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants
affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can
evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled
experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional
developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web
application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled
trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.
[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in
subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither
difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was
statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase
1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous
productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in
task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was
55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants
can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning
signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research
focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the
build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during
implementation.

TL;DR: This study explores the perspectives of industry practitioners involved in co-designing and delivering software engineering courses with academia at the University of Glasgow, providing recommendations for sustainable future collaborations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on the experiences and perspectives of industry practitioners contributing to course design and delivery, as their involvement requires significant effort and support.

Method: A retrospective study was conducted involving practitioner co-authors sharing their experiences, with academic co-authors facilitating discussions. Emerging themes were analyzed to draw conclusions.

Result: The study identified key themes related to the motivations, expectations, and experiences of practitioners. It provides insights into better managing their engagement and sustaining collaborative efforts.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of understanding practitioner perspectives to improve industry-academia collaborations in course co-development and ensure their long-term viability.

Abstract: Over more than two decades, The University of Glasgow has co-designed and
delivered numerous software engineering focused courses with industry partners,
covering both technical and discipline specific professional skills. Such
collaborations are not unique and many of the benefits are well recognised in
the literature. These include enhancing the real-world relevance of curricula,
developing student professional networks ahead of graduation and easing
recruitment opportunities for employers.
  However, there is relatively little scholarship on the perspectives of
industry practitioners who participate in course design and delivery. This gap
is significant, since the effort invested by practitioners is often substantial
and may require ongoing support from both the industry partner and academic
institution. Understanding the motivations, expectations and experiences of
practitioners who engage in course delivery can guide the formation of future
partnerships and ensure their long-term sustainability.
  We begin to address this gap by reporting on the outcomes of a retrospective
conducted amongst the practitioner coauthors of this paper, with the academic
coauthors acting as facilitators. All coauthors have participated in the recent
co-design and delivery of software engineering courses, but we choose to focus
explicitly on the perspectives of the practitioners. We report on the themes
that emerged from the discussions and our resulting recommendations for future
collaborations.

*Omar Claflin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach to sparse autoencoder (SAE) design that resolves issues like polysemanticity and behavioral errors by introducing dual encoding and joint-training architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE approaches face challenges in eliminating polysemanticity and exhibit pathological errors despite good reconstruction fidelity. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a dual encoding hypothesis and develop both sequential and joint-training architectures to capture feature identity and integration patterns simultaneously. They incorporate small nonlinear components for parameter efficiency and conduct intervention experiments using factorial stimulus designs.

Result: Joint-training architectures achieve significant improvements in reconstruction (41.3%) and error reduction (51.6%). They also revealed bimodal feature organization and demonstrated meaningful nonlinear feature interaction effects on model behavior.

Conclusion: The paper provides evidence of dual encoding in neural networks and introduces a paradigm shift towards integrated computational design, laying the groundwork for advanced SAE frameworks.

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network
interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear
superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction
fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit
pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode
information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:
feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding
hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture
identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%
reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This
architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared
norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing
directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve
16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of
computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention
experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration
features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and
produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant
interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic
evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful
nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural
paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational
design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for analyzing brain-behavior correlation while minimizing the effects of variables like age.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in brain imaging studies that fail to account for confounding variables such as age, potentially leading to inaccurate analyses.

Method: Developed a partial correlation mapping strategy that removes unwanted effects like age and global cortical area differences to improve localization of correlation differences.

Result: Demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to effectively identify regions with significant brain-behavior correlations in high-functioning autistic individuals.

Conclusion: The new framework enhances visualization and accuracy in detecting correlation differences, outperforming traditional linear models in clarity and intuitiveness.

Abstract: This paper presents a streamlined image analysis framework for correlating
behavioral measures to anatomical measures on the cortex and detecting the
regions of abnormal brain-behavior correlates. We correlated a facial emotion
discrimination task score and its response time to cortical thickness
measurements in a group of high functioning autistic subjects. Many previous
correlation studies in brain imaging neglect to account for unwanted age effect
and other variables and the subsequent statistical parametric maps may report
spurious results. We demonstrate that the partial correlation mapping strategy
proposed here can remove the effect of age and global cortical area difference
effectively while localizing the regions of high correlation difference. The
advantage of the proposed correlation mapping strategy over the general linear
model framework is that we can directly visualize more intuitive correlation
measures across the cortex in each group.

### [148] [Disentangled Feature Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00260)
*Jin-Hong Du,Kathryn Roeder,Larry Wasserman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Disentangled Feature Importance (DFI), a method addressing bias in feature importance quantification caused by correlated predictors. It uses optimal transport to disentangle features and attributes importance scores, offering a computationally efficient and theoretically robust approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature importance quantification methods struggle with biased contributions when predictors are correlated. The study aims to address this fundamental limitation and proposes a new approach to handle such correlations.

Method: The authors propose DFI, which uses optimal transport to convert correlated features into independent latent variables. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and then mapped back to the original feature space via sensitivity analysis of the transport map.

Result: DFI eliminates correlation distortion and provides a consistent and asymptotically normal estimation of importance scores. It achieves computational efficiency and second-order error rates when estimation errors are small.

Conclusion: DFI addresses the limitations of existing feature importance methods under correlated predictors, offering a principled, computationally efficient, and theoretically sound approach to quantify feature contributions.

Abstract: Feature importance quantification faces a fundamental challenge: when
predictors are correlated, standard methods systematically underestimate their
contributions. We prove that major existing approaches target identical
population functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this
correlation-induced bias.
  To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Disentangled Feature
Importance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$
decomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into
independent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation
distortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed
back through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled
decomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability
for latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA
variances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.
  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general
transport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of
importance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original
feature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve
second-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and
transport map estimation errors are $o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI
avoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the
challenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Aux-VAE, a new approach for disentangling generative factors in complex data using minimal changes to standard VAE architecture with auxiliary variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable the disentangling of low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent factors in high-dimensional, complex datasets, especially in unsupervised settings.

Method: The method involves modifying the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by introducing auxiliary variables to guide the latent space and align factors with prior statistical knowledge.

Result: Aux-VAE effectively disentangles latent variables, as demonstrated through comparative analyses on multiple datasets, including astronomical simulations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Aux-VAE provides a simple yet effective means to achieve disentanglement in complex datasets with minimal changes to the standard VAE framework.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of statistically extracting generative
factors from complex, high-dimensional datasets in unsupervised or
semi-supervised settings. We investigate encoder-decoder-based generative
models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, focusing on disentangling
low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent physical factors.
Introducing Aux-VAE, a novel architecture within the classical Variational
Autoencoder framework, we achieve disentanglement with minimal modifications to
the standard VAE loss function by leveraging prior statistical knowledge
through auxiliary variables. These variables guide the shaping of the latent
space by aligning latent factors with learned auxiliary variables. We validate
the efficacy of Aux-VAE through comparative assessments on multiple datasets,
including astronomical simulations.

### [150] [GRAND: Graph Release with Assured Node Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00402)
*Suqing Liu,Xuan Bi,Tianxi Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRAND, the first mechanism to guarantee node-level differential privacy while releasing entire networks and maintaining structural properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for network data privacy either restrict outputs to specific statistics or don't preserve network structures, highlighting a gap for node-level differential privacy methods capable of releasing entire networks.

Method: The authors propose 'GRAND', a privacy-preserving mechanism that releases full networks while ensuring node-level differential privacy, under latent space models that mimic the original network's distribution.

Result: GRAND effectively preserves key structural and statistical properties of the network, validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GRAND represents a breakthrough in privacy-preserving network releases, ensuring node-level differential privacy while maintaining network fidelity, bridging a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Differential privacy is a well-established framework for safeguarding
sensitive information in data. While extensively applied across various
domains, its application to network data -- particularly at the node level --
remains underexplored. Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus
exclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified
network statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the
network. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node
Differential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
network release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring
node-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties. Under a
broad class of latent space models, we show that the released network
asymptotically follows the same distribution as the original network. The
effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Denis Belomestny,John. Schoenmakers*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Monte Carlo-based method for solving the Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP), focusing on entropic optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient algorithms for solving the Schrödinger Bridge Problem in entropic optimal transport, particularly for general reference processes and end-point distributions.

Method: A forward-reverse iterative Monte Carlo procedure with kernel-based regression is used to approximate Schrödinger potentials via Picard iteration while ensuring algorithm convergence using Hilbert metric properties.

Result: The paper demonstrates theoretical convergence, provides convergence rates, proves the optimality of potential estimates, and showcases the method’s application in non-nested Monte Carlo simulations for Schrödinger Bridge process distributions.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust, nonparametric algorithm with provable convergence for approximating Schrödinger potentials and advancing SBP simulations, contributing to entropic optimal transport research.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is
central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and
begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte
Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric
way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context
of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in
the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we
develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence
rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an
application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final
dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the
constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for
conditional diffusions.

### [152] [An in depth look at the Procrustes-Wasserstein distance: properties and barycenters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00894)
*Davide Adamo,Marco Corneli,Manon Vuillien,Emmanuelle Vila*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) distance as an optimal transport metric for better alignment and comparison of point clouds, proposes initialization strategies, defines barycenters for shape representation, and demonstrates superior performance in applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in effectively aligning and comparing point clouds, especially in tasks requiring invariance to rigid transformations like rotations and reflections, where traditional Wasserstein distance may fall short.

Method: The paper carefully constructs a space of discrete probability measures in which PW is a valid distance, explores multiple initialization strategies for existing algorithms, and introduces a PW barycenter concept with an algorithm for estimating representative shapes.

Result: The proposed PW framework and barycenters outperform existing optimal transport methods in alignment and shape preservation tasks, with demonstrated applications in 2D/3D point cloud analysis, including an archaeological context.

Conclusion: Procrustes-Wasserstein is a promising metric for machine learning and computational geometry, enabling precise alignment and shape analysis. The PW barycenter method expands its practical applicability to diverse scenarios, such as archaeology.

Abstract: Due to its invariance to rigid transformations such as rotations and
reflections, Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) was introduced in the literature as an
optimal transport (OT) distance, alternative to Wasserstein and more suited to
tasks such as the alignment and comparison of point clouds. Having that
application in mind, we carefully build a space of discrete probability
measures and show that over that space PW actually is a distance. Algorithms to
solve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by
discussing and testing several initialization strategies. We then introduce the
notion of PW barycenter and detail an algorithm to estimate it from the data.
The result is a new method to compute representative shapes from a collection
of point clouds. We benchmark our method against existing OT approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in scenarios requiring precise alignment and
shape preservation. We finally show the usefulness of the PW barycenters in an
archaeological context. Our results highlight the potential of PW in boosting
2D and 3D point cloud analysis for machine learning and computational geometry
applications.

*Deland Liu,Frigyes Samuel Racz,Zoe Lalji,Jose del R. Millan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study examines the potential of non-invasive EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to enable communication for completely locked-in ALS patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether patients in the completely locked-in state (CLIS) due to ALS can achieve volitional communication using non-invasive BCIs.

Method: An EEG-based BCI system was tested on a CLIS patient, allowing "Yes"/"No" responses by modulating alpha and beta brainwave power in response to real-time auditory feedback during multiple online sessions.

Result: The patient communicated assistive needs accurately across all sessions and showed an improvement in accuracy, but performance on general knowledge questions varied with only two sessions above chance.

Conclusion: Non-invasive BCIs show potential for enabling basic communication in completely locked-in ALS patients, although performance consistency might be an issue.

Abstract: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the completely locked-in
state (CLIS) can lose all reliable motor control and are left without any means
of communication. It remains unknown whether non-invasive electroencephalogram
(EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can support volitional
communication in CLIS. Here, we show that a CLIS patient was able to operate an
EEG-based BCI across multiple online sessions to respond to both general
knowledge and personally relevant assistive questions. The patient delivered
"Yes"/"No" responses by volitionally modulating alpha and beta band power at
different channels, guided by real-time auditory feedback from the BCI. The
patient communicated assistive needs above chance in all sessions, achieving a
perfect score in the final session. Performance on general knowledge questions
varied across sessions, with two sessions showing accurate and above-chance
responses, while the first and last sessions remained at chance level. The
patient also showed consistent modulation patterns over time. These findings
suggest that non-invasive BCIs may offer a potential pathway for restoring
basic communication in CLIS.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This survey reviews multi-LLMs for edge computing, focusing on their collaborative advantages in resource-constrained, multimodal, and privacy-sensitive environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing needs enhanced AI models capable of complex reasoning and handling multimodal data, which traditional models struggle to achieve.

Method: The paper explores multi-LLM systems, discussing enabling technologies like dynamic orchestration, resource scheduling, and cross-domain knowledge integration, along with multimodal architectures for thorough analysis.

Result: Multi-LLM systems showcase improved adaptability and task performance in edge computing, with insights into architectures and methodologies for their deployment.

Conclusion: Multi-LLM systems show significant promise for advancing edge AI applications, though challenges like resource efficiency, trust, and privacy still need targeted research.

Abstract: Edge computing enables real-time data processing closer to its source, thus
improving the latency and performance of edge-enabled AI applications. However,
traditional AI models often fall short when dealing with complex, dynamic tasks
that require advanced reasoning and multimodal data processing. This survey
explores the integration of multi-LLMs (Large Language Models) to address this
in edge computing, where multiple specialized LLMs collaborate to enhance task
performance and adaptability in resource-constrained environments. We review
the transition from conventional edge AI models to single LLM deployment and,
ultimately, to multi-LLM systems. The survey discusses enabling technologies
such as dynamic orchestration, resource scheduling, and cross-domain knowledge
transfer that are key for multi-LLM implementation. A central focus is on
trusted multi-LLM systems, ensuring robust decision-making in environments
where reliability and privacy are crucial. We also present multimodal multi-LLM
architectures, where multiple LLMs specialize in handling different data
modalities, such as text, images, and audio, by integrating their outputs for
comprehensive analysis. Finally, we highlight future directions, including
improving resource efficiency, trustworthy governance multi-LLM systems, while
addressing privacy, trust, and robustness concerns. This survey provides a
valuable reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to leverage
multi-LLM systems in edge computing applications.

*Zain Taufique,Aman Vyas,Antonio Miele,Pasi Liljeberg,Anil Kanduri*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces Twill, a framework for scheduling Compound AI workloads on mobile platforms, reducing latency by 54% while adhering to power constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and dynamic nature of compound AI workloads necessitate efficient scheduling solutions on mobile edge platforms, which is not addressed by existing strategies.

Method: The Twill framework uses task affinity-aware cluster mapping, migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) to manage concurrent AI tasks.

Result: Twill significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a 54% reduction in inference latency on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform.

Conclusion: Twill provides a practical solution for deploying compound AI systems on mobile platforms, optimizing both latency and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

*Congye Wang,Matthew A. Fisher,Heishiro Kanagawa,Wilson Chen,Chris. J. Oates*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: This paper builds on previous breakthroughs in adaptive tuning of Metropolis-Hastings using Reinforcement Learning and proposes a new reward metric to improve sampler training, showcasing its effectiveness through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in the complexity of sampling algorithms has made their tuning more challenging, necessitating solutions that view sampler tuning as a learning task.

Method: The authors propose a novel reward metric based on contrastive divergence for Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) and design adaptive gradient-based samplers to enhance both flexibility and learnability.

Result: Using the posteriordb benchmark, the study demonstrates superior training outcomes for RLMH with the proposed metric and highlights the practical benefits of adaptive gradient-based samplers.

Conclusion: Contrastive divergence provides a stronger training signal for Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings, and the adaptive gradient-based samplers developed in the paper show strong practical utility in simulation studies.

Abstract: Sampling algorithms drive probabilistic machine learning, and recent years
have seen an explosion in the diversity of tools for this task. However, the
increasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase
in the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning
of samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough,
Wang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,
opening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical
benefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for
subsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the
surprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,
or the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training
RLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,
whose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we
explore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that
balance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the
associated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb
benchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH.

*Wenjin Mo,Zhiyuan Li,Minghong Fang,Mingwei Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedPoisonMIA, a poisoning membership inference attack targeting federated learning (FL), demonstrating its efficacy, and proposes an accompanying defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerabilities of federated learning, particularly in the context of privacy risks from poisoning attacks that have received limited attention.

Method: The authors developed and tested FedPoisonMIA, where malicious clients craft updates to infer membership information in FL. They also propose a defense mechanism to counter this attack.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show the effectiveness of FedPoisonMIA, while the proposed defense reduces its potency to some extent.

Conclusion: The study reveals a new privacy threat to FL and provides initial steps toward mitigating it, emphasizing the need for further research into robust defenses.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without
needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the
era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to
adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning
attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data
to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade
the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to
privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA,
a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA
involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership
information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate
the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various
datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach
reduces its impact to a degree.

*Linard Arquint,Samarth Kishor,Jason R. Koenig,Joey Dodds,Daniel Kroening,Peter Müller*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Diodon,' a methodology that combines manual and automated verifications to address scalability in program verifiers for large codebases, focusing on separating critical security parts from the rest.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Program verifiers excel at proving security properties but fail to scale to large codebases due to manual effort intensity. The motivation is to find a scalable approach for verifying security protocols in extensive software projects.

Method: The authors use a novel split methodology dividing the codebase into Core (security protocol) and Application (non-critical code). They apply semi-automated verification to the Core while using static analyses to prove I/O independence in the Application, ensuring security properties are intact.

Result: Diodon proved effective in two case studies, including securing a critical Core of a 100k+ LoC Go application, using Gobra to verify only 1% of the code in under three months, achieving secrecy and injective agreement guarantees.

Conclusion: Diodon demonstrates a feasible and efficient way to combine semi-automated verification and static analyses for verifying large-scale codebases with robust security guarantees.

Abstract: Existing program verifiers can prove advanced properties about security
protocol implementations, but are difficult to scale to large codebases because
of the manual effort required. We develop a novel methodology called *Diodon*
that addresses this challenge by splitting the codebase into the protocol
implementation (the *Core*) and the remainder (the *Application*). This split
allows us to apply powerful semi-automated verification techniques to the
security-critical Core, while fully-automatic static analyses scale the
verification to the entire codebase by ensuring that the Application cannot
invalidate the security properties proved for the Core. The static analyses
achieve that by proving *I/O independence*, i.e., that the I/O operations
within the Application are independent of the Core's security-relevant data
(such as keys), and that the Application meets the Core's requirements. We have
proved Diodon sound by first showing that we can safely allow the Application
to perform I/O independent of the security protocol, and second that manual
verification and static analyses soundly compose. We evaluate Diodon on two
case studies: an implementation of the signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange and a
large (100k+ LoC) production Go codebase implementing a key exchange protocol
for which we obtained secrecy and injective agreement guarantees by verifying a
Core of about 1% of the code with the auto-active program verifier Gobra in
less than three person months.

*Craig S Wright*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper formally specifies and proves the security and optimality of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) protocols as originally defined for Bitcoin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correct misconceptions about SPV, establish its security and scalability under bounded adversarial assumptions, and provide a rigorous foundation for its implementation in digital cash systems.

Method: The authors reconstructed SPV from first principles using symbolic automata, Merkle proof structures, and game-theoretic analysis. Probabilistic security bounds were derived, and low-bandwidth optimizations introduced.

Result: SPV is proven secure and optimal under bounded adversarial assumptions. The paper provides methods to optimize bandwidth while maintaining correctness.

Conclusion: This work refutes misrepresentations of SPV, describing it as secure and ideal for scalable transaction verification in non-validating clients.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description,
and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as
originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark
contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding
non-validating clients.

*Grey Kuling,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: KUL-KT is a biologically inspired knowledge tracing architecture using Hebbian memory with gradient-based consolidation, achieving superior performance and efficiency for personalized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a biologically inspired, memory-efficient, and input-flexible architecture to address the challenges of continual learning and personalization in knowledge tracing.

Method: KUL-KT employs a Hebbian memory mechanism with time-decaying updates for forgetting, combined with a Loss-aligned Internal Target method for learning without backpropagation through time. The system uses a fast memory for single updates and a slower network for consolidation via gradient descent.

Result: KUL-KT outperformed baselines on ten KT benchmarks in metrics like nDCG and Recall@10, showed effective classroom deployment with improved perceived helpfulness, and achieved faster training with significantly reduced memory use (99.01% less).

Conclusion: KUL-KT offers a biologically inspired, scalable framework that excels in personalized learning through efficient, flexible, and memory-conserving mechanisms informed by neural principles.

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge
tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based
consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the
principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by
introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that
enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target
(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning
without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast
Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative
update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through
gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural
forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.
Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured
(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT
outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive
metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT
personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved
learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation
studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual
adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x
faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a
biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for
personalized learning at scale.
