### [1] [Sketch2BIM: A Multi-Agent Human-AI Collaborative Pipeline to Convert Hand-Drawn Floor Plans to 3D BIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20838)
*Abir Khan Ratul,Sanjay Acharjee,Somin Park,Md Nazmus Sakib*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a pipeline using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to convert hand-drawn sketches into detailed 3D BIM models, achieving high precision through human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to simplify and democratize Building Information Modeling (BIM) creation using freehand sketches, making the process more accessible for non-experts and reducing time required for floor plan designs.

Method: The workflow utilizes a combination of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), human feedback, schema validation, and automated scripting to iteratively refine sketches into structured JSON layouts, ultimately generating 3D BIM models.

Result: Experiments on various floor plans showed high convergence rates with precision, recall, F1 scores above 0.83, and progressively reduced geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) through feedback iterations.

Conclusion: MLLM-driven frameworks can significantly improve BIM creation accuracy, enabling both experts and non-experts to produce semantically consistent 3D models efficiently using simple hand-drawn sketches.

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

### [2] [Cultural Alien Sampler: Open-ended art generation balancing originality and coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20849)
*Alejandro H. Artiles,Hiromu Yakura,Levin Brinkmann,Mar Canet Sola,Hassan Abu Alhaija,Ignacio Serna,Nasim Rahaman,Bernhard Schölkopf,Iyad Rahwan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS) to improve idea generation in autonomous agents by balancing originality and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to effectively balance originality and internal coherence, often retaining familiar patterns or losing coherence when pushed towards creativity.

Method: CAS uses two fine-tuned GPT-2 models: a Concept Coherence Model for plausibly co-occurring concepts and a Cultural Context Model for determining how typical they are in specific artists' works.

Result: CAS outperformed the baseline methods, achieved human-like creative evaluation results, and demonstrated broader conceptual diversity compared to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Artificial cultural alienness via CAS can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents by enabling them to generate coherent yet unconventional ideas.

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

### [3] [Fuzzy numbers revisited: operations on extensional fuzzy numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20861)
*Krzysztof Siminski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of fuzzy numbers by introducing extensional fuzzy numbers, defined with operations and relational operators, along with implementation examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzzy numbers face limitations in computational complexity, consistency of results, and increasing fuzziness over operations, which restrict their applicability.

Method: The paper revisits fuzzy numbers with a new approach called 'extensional fuzzy numbers,' defines their operations and relational operators, and provides computational examples using C++ implementation.

Result: Extensional fuzzy numbers solve issues like high computational complexity, inconsistent results, and fuzzy spread, demonstrated in several examples.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the applicability of fuzzy numbers by overcoming key issues, and practical implementation is provided publicly for further exploration.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

### [4] [Customizing Open Source LLMs for Quantitative Medication Attribute Extraction across Heterogeneous EHR Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21027)
*Zhe Fei,Mehmet Yigit Turali,Shreyas Rajesh,Xinyang Dai,Huyen Pham,Pavan Holur,Yuhui Zhu,Larissa Mooney,Yih-Ing Hser,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework utilizing customized open-source large language models (LLMs) to extract consistent medication data across different EHR systems for opioid use disorder (OUD) patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of harmonizing medication data (specifically for opioid use disorder treatments) across heterogeneous and fragmented EHR systems.

Method: A framework using customized LLMs (such as Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma) was developed. It extracts key prescription attributes and calculates a standardized medication coverage metric called MOUD days. It processes records in a standard JSON schema, with normalization and consistency checks.

Result: Among tested models, Qwen2.5-32B achieved the highest performance with 93.4% coverage and 93.0% exact-match accuracy, while MedGemma-27B achieved 93.1% coverage and 92.2% accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach removes the dependence on site-specific data pipelines and allows for consistent, privacy-preserved analysis of MOUD adherence and treatment.

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

### [5] [Epistemic Deference to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21043)
*Benjamin Lange*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines when AI outputs should replace or complement human judgment, proposing a framework called 'a total evidence view of AI deference' rather than full reliance on AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing reliance on AI systems that outperform human experts in certain areas, raising questions about their role in decision-making and when it is justified to defer to AI over human judgment.

Method: The author critiques the concept of AI Preemptionism, which advocates for complete replacement of human judgment by AI outputs. They develop an alternative approach called 'a total evidence view of AI deference,' leveraging social epistemology to argue against blind trust in AI systems.

Result: The study highlights that the alternative 'total evidence view' mitigates the risks of uncritical deference, expertise attrition, and mistrust of AI. It demonstrates that AI outputs should serve as support rather than outright replacements for human reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while relying on AI systems can be efficient at times, a balanced approach that incorporates both AI outputs and human judgment ensures better epistemic practices, especially in critical high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

### [6] [From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045)
*Ali Khosravi Kazazi,Zhenlong Li,M. Naser Lessani,Guido Cervone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-agent framework for translating natural language into spatial SQL queries, addressing challenges in semantic and syntactic complexities. It achieves significant accuracy improvements, emphasizing accessibility in spatial data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify spatial data analysis for non-experts by overcoming challenges in Structured Query Language (SQL) complexity and geospatial functions.

Method: A multi-agent framework is developed with components such as knowledge base profiling, context retrieval with embeddings, and a collaborative agent pipeline for query construction and validation.

Result: The system demonstrated accuracy of 81.2% on KaggleDBQA and 87.7% on a new SpatialQueryQA benchmark, outperforming methods without a review agent, and showed improved semantic alignment with user intent.

Conclusion: The framework advances accessibility in spatial data analysis and sets a foundation for autonomous spatial Text-to-SQL systems, improving query accuracy and user alignment.

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

### [7] [MedAlign: A Synergistic Framework of Multimodal Preference Optimization and Federated Meta-Cognitive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21093)
*Siyong Chen,Jinbo Wen,Jiawen Kang,Tenghui Huang,Xumin Huang,Yuanjia Su,Hudan Pan,Zishao Zhong,Dusit Niyato,Shengli Xie,Dong In Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedAlign is introduced as a novel framework to tackle challenges in deploying Large Vision-Language Models for medical services, focusing on visual accuracy, adaptive reasoning, and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are significant barriers in the implementation of LVLMs for clinical services, such as hallucinations, inefficiencies in reasoning, and limitations in collaborative approaches.

Method: MedAlign uses multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO), RA-MoE architecture for routing queries to specialized models, and a federated governance mechanism enabling adaptive reasoning and collaboration.

Result: MedAlign outperformed baseline models on Med-VQA datasets with an improvement of up to 11.85% in F1-score and reduced reasoning length by 51.60%.

Conclusion: MedAlign demonstrates a promising approach for enhancing the accuracy, efficiency, and collaborative potential of LVLMs in the domain of medical visual question answering.

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

### [8] [Confounding Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Causal Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21110)
*Mingxuan Li,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm to handle confounding biases in off-policy data, outperforming standard DQN methods across confounded Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of unobserved confounding in off-policy learning, which affects policy performance in high-dimensional domains.

Method: The proposed method builds on Deep Q-Networks (DQN), introducing an algorithm designed to create a safe policy for worst-case environments compatible with the given observations.

Result: The method was tested on twelve Atari games with confounded scenarios and consistently performed better than standard DQN wherever confounding biases affected the learning process.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the robustness and superiority of the proposed algorithm in handling unobserved confounders, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving better policy performance under biased conditions.

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

### [9] [DAO-AI: Evaluating Collective Decision-Making through Agentic AI in Decentralized Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21117)
*Chunghyun Han,Alfio Gliozzo,Junkyu Lee,Agostino Capponi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study empirically examines autonomous AI agents as decision-makers in decentralized governance using financial simulations and verifiable blockchain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of agentic AI as autonomous decision-makers in decentralized governance, ensuring alignment and trustworthy augmentation of human decisions.

Method: Developed an AI voter that interprets proposal contexts, retrieves deliberation data, and determines voting positions within a financial simulation based on blockchain data using an Agentics framework.

Result: The AI exhibited strong alignment with human and token-weighted decisions, validated through evaluation metrics, demonstrating its reliability in DAO governance contexts.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can enhance DAO governance by providing interpretable, auditable, and data-driven decision-making, further contributing to the design of explainable AI for decentralized financial systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

### [10] [PanicToCalm: A Proactive Counseling Agent for Panic Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21143)
*Jihyun Lee,Yejin Min,San Kim,Yejin Jeon,SungJun Yang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces PACE, a distress episode dataset, and PACER, a counseling model trained on this data to aid during panic attacks. The model excels in providing empathetic and directive support, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of datasets and methods tailored to address acute panic attacks motivated the creation of PACE and PACER, aiming to enhance effective crisis intervention.

Method: The authors constructed the PACE dataset from first-person narratives, trained PACER using supervised learning and preference alignment, and evaluated it with PanicEval, a framework for assessing counseling quality.

Result: PACER surpasses baseline models in metrics like counseling quality and client affect improvement, with human evaluations preferring it over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4 models.

Conclusion: PACER, trained on the novel PACE dataset, offers significant practical value in handling panic episodes, outperforming current counseling models in effectiveness.

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm
).

### [11] [NeuroGenPoisoning: Neuron-Guided Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation of LLM via Genetic Optimization of External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21144)
*Hanyu Zhu,Lance Fiondella,Jiawei Yuan,Kai Zeng,Long Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel attack framework called NeuroGenPoisoning for generating poisoned external knowledge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through neuron attribution and genetic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of poisoned external knowledge that can override internal memory in RAG systems, as there is limited understanding of RAG poisoning mechanisms and conflict resolution with parametric knowledge.

Method: The framework identifies Poison-Responsive Neurons linked to poisoning knowledge, employs genetic algorithms to evolve adversarial passages, and reuses promising variants through attribution signals to optimize poisoning attacks.

Result: Experiments show over 90% Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) across models and datasets, demonstrating effective poisoning while maintaining fluency.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that neuron-guided poisoning in RAG resolves knowledge conflicts and highlights vulnerabilities in RAG systems that adversaries can exploit using generated poisoned knowledge.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

### [12] [How to Auto-optimize Prompts for Domain Tasks? Adaptive Prompting and Reasoning through Evolutionary Domain Knowledge Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21148)
*Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGO-Prompt is a framework that optimizes prompts and reasoning processes for LLMs, improving domain-specific task performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating domain knowledge, optimizing reasoning efficiency, and assisting experts in refining knowledge for LLMs on domain-specific tasks.

Method: Automated refinement and optimization of Semantic Causal Graphs (SCGs) with a textual gradient process that enhances reasoning guidance and adapts the LLM for efficient use.

Result: EGO-Prompt demonstrated 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 scores compared to top methods, enabling smaller models to perform at levels similar to larger models, while maintaining lower costs.

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt refines SCGs and reasoning processes for enhanced LLM performance, enabling cost-efficient model optimization and improved interpretability for domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

### [13] [String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21150)
*Kou Misaki,Takuya Akiba*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a prompting method designed to improve Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF) for language models, enhancing response diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with tasks requiring probabilistic responses, leading to bias and limited diversity in outputs, which impacts applications like human-behavior simulation and content diversification.

Method: The proposed SSoT method prompts an LLM to generate a random string to increase entropy and manipulate it for deriving final answers, improving diversity while maintaining constraints.

Result: SSoT significantly enhances LLM performance in PIF tasks, approaching ideal random performance and boosting response diversity in open-ended tasks as demonstrated by experiments on NoveltyBench.

Conclusion: SSoT improves PIF and response diversity in LLMs, addressing current limitations in probabilistic behavior and task diversity, beneficial for both closed-set and open-ended tasks.

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

### [14] [Memory-Free Continual Learning with Null Space Adaptation for Zero-Shot Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21175)
*Yujin Jo,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NuSA-CL, a framework for continual learning in pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) that preserves zero-shot capabilities while adapting to new tasks with minimal computational and memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adapting pre-trained vision-language models to continually evolving environments and novel tasks without catastrophic forgetting, especially when zero-shot capabilities are insufficient.

Method: NuSA-CL uses low-rank adaptation and constrains task-specific updates to remain within an approximate null space of the model's current parameters. This approach minimizes interference with previously learned knowledge without relying on memory-heavy techniques like replay buffers or distillation.

Result: NuSA-CL shows strong performance on continual learning benchmarks while preserving the zero-shot transfer capabilities, demonstrating practical applicability in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: NuSA-CL is a scalable and efficient solution for continually evolving pre-trained VLMs, making it ideal for real-world deployment in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

### [15] [Shylock: Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series based on Hybrid Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21181)
*Shuo Li,Keqin Xu,Jie Liu,Dan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Shylock, a method for detecting causal relationships in multivariate time series, which improves performance on both small and regular datasets, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods are susceptible to errors, rely heavily on assumptions and large datasets, and are prone to overfitting, especially with multivariate time series data that often suffer from data gaps.

Method: The paper introduces Shylock, which uses group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel to reduce parameters exponentially while learning time-delayed representations effectively. It integrates global and local constraints for improved performance and efficient information sharing.

Result: Shylock outperforms two state-of-the-art methods in causal discovery tasks involving both few-shot and normal multivariate time series across benchmark and newly generated datasets.

Conclusion: Shylock demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency in detecting causal relationships in complex time series data. The authors also developed the Tcausal library and deployed it on EarthDataMiner for practical usability.

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

TL;DR: OutboundEval is a benchmark for assessing large language models' (LLMs) capability in expert-level outbound calling scenarios, improving dataset diversity, user simulation, and evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs in outbound calling suffer from limitations, including poor dataset diversity, unrealistic user simulation, and unreliable metrics.

Method: OutboundEval introduces a benchmark across major business domains, leverages a model-driven User Simulator for realistic testing, and employs adaptive evaluation methods with automated and human-in-the-loop processes.

Result: Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrated trade-offs between task completion and interaction fluency, offering insights into creating effective outbound AI systems.

Conclusion: OutboundEval sets a robust and extensible standard for evaluating LLMs in professional outbound applications.

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large
language models (LLMs) in expert-level intelligent outbound calling scenarios.
Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business
domains and 30 representative sub-scenarios, each with scenario-specific
process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

*Victoria J. Hodge,Colin Paterson,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques for ensuring the safety of AI-enabled autonomous systems, particularly in safety-critical domains, and outlines challenges and areas for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expanding application and operational capabilities of autonomous systems necessitate robust safety assurance methods, especially to handle novel situations and out-of-distribution data.

Method: The paper analyzes various existing OOD detection techniques, defines key concepts, explores challenges, and maps these techniques to different stages of the ML lifecycle for safety assurance.

Result: It identifies an array of OOD detection approaches and highlights their integration potential within the system lifecycle for improving safety assurance.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of OOD detection in safety-critical systems, provides caveats for engineers, and highlights the necessity for further research to ensure safe development and operation of autonomous systems.

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

### [18] [Investigating Scale Independent UCT Exploration Factor Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21275)
*Robin Schmöcker,Christoph Schnell,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the reward scale dependency of the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (UCT) algorithm and presents adaptive strategies for setting the UCT exploration constant, with a focus on reward-scale agnostic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT is sensitive to the reward scale of games, which creates challenges for games with dense, hand-picked reward scales.

Method: The authors evaluate both existing and five proposed strategies for adaptively selecting the exploration constant, using experimental comparisons.

Result: A newly proposed method, where the exploration constant is set as twice the standard deviation of Q-values, outperformed other strategies across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The suggested $ \lambda = 2   \cdot   \sigma$ strategy is recommended for its effectiveness and adaptability in optimizing the UCT algorithm.

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

### [19] [When Models Outthink Their Safety: Mitigating Self-Jailbreak in Large Reasoning Models with Chain-of-Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21285)
*Yingzhi Mao,Chunkang Zhang,Junxiang Wang,Xinyan Guan,Boxi Cao,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) concerning safety, introduces the 'Self-Jailbreak' phenomenon where models override their risk assessments, and proposes a Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) framework to improve safety without compromising reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve the issue of safety-reasoning trade-offs in LRMs, which are prone to generating harmful outputs despite inherently having the capability to reject unsafe queries.

Method: The Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG) framework recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, redirecting the model to safe trajectories while preserving its reasoning chains.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the CoG framework significantly enhances the safety of LRMs while preserving their reasoning ability, outperforming previous methods that fail to address safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the inherent ability of LRMs to reject unsafe queries and the potential of the CoG framework to mitigate safety risks in LRMs effectively, ensuring a balanced approach between reasoning ability and safety measures.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews how AI trustworthiness is conceptualized and measured in AIES and FAccT conferences, highlighting a lack of focus on sociotechnical dimensions and offering holistic approaches for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the narrow focus on technical aspects of trustworthy AI and examine sociotechnical perspectives for a comprehensive understanding in real-world contexts.

Method: A scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings was conducted to systematically analyze definitions, approaches, and gaps regarding AI trustworthiness.

Result: The study identifies significant advancements in technical attributes but emphasizes overlooked social and ethical aspects. Trustworthiness is shown as a contested concept influenced by power dynamics.

Conclusion: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical and sociotechnical dimensions is required, along with actionable strategies to integrate holistic frameworks for responsible AI development.

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining symbolic verification and interactive validation for better code generation in embodied agents, enhancing task success rates and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of limited environmental grounding in code generation for embodied agents which leads to suboptimal task success rates.

Method: Introduces neuro-symbolic embodied task planning with exploratory code for active interaction and validation in dynamic and partially observable environments.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows 46.2% improvement in task success rates and 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions compared to Code-as-Policies baselines.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances code grounding and task reliability in complex environments, advancing the capabilities of LLM-based embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CXRAgent, a multi-stage agent for robust and adaptive chest X-ray interpretation, combining advanced tool coordination, diagnostic planning, and collaborative decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CXR models struggle with adapting to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios due to single diagnostic pipelines and lack of mechanisms to assess tools' reliability.

Method: CXRAgent employs a director-orchestrated multi-stage process that includes tool invocation, diagnostic planning through expert team coordination, and collaborative decision-making integrating evidence and contextual memory.

Result: CXRAgent demonstrates strong performance across various CXR interpretation tasks, supports reliable diagnosis with visual evidence, and generalizes effectively to tasks of varying complexity.

Conclusion: CXRAgent enhances adaptability and credibility in CXR interpretation by combining strategic tool orchestration, evidence validation, and collaborative reasoning.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Magellan, a framework using Monte Carlo Tree Search with hierarchical guidance to enhance creative idea generation by LLMs, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to generate innovative ideas, defaulting to familiar concepts due to limitations in their self-evaluation heuristics during exploration.

Method: Magellan uses Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a hierarchical system, including semantic compass vectors for direction and reward functions for coherence, novelty, and narrative progress.

Result: Experiments show Magellan outperforms baselines like ReAct and ToT in generating scientifically plausible and innovative ideas.

Conclusion: Principled guided exploration enables LLMs to be more effective in creative discovery compared to unconstrained methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance test-time scaling for mathematical reasoning, achieving higher accuracy with reduced token usage compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in reasoning when trained with verbose responses during supervised fine-tuning, especially on smaller models. The paper seeks an alternative method to improve reasoning efficiently while addressing token inefficiency.

Method: The authors integrate reinforcement learning (RL) into the training, using budget forcing and a limited set of 1.5K training samples to optimize token efficiency and performance of a 1.5B parameter model.

Result: The SFT+RL framework demonstrates better performance on the GSM8K dataset across various compute budgets, with an over 40% reduction in token usage and improved accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can overcome the drawbacks of supervised fine-tuning for long-context training, enabling improved efficiency and reasoning performance in smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of systematic understanding and ineffective integration of symbolic AI techniques into large language models.

Method: Review existing Neurosymbolic AI approaches, propose a taxonomy with four key dimensions, and categorize the literature to create a roadmap.

Result: Outlined critical benchmarks, advancements, and gaps in symbolic integration methods for LLMs, providing insights into potential implementations.

Conclusion: The paper offers a framework and roadmap to enhance transparency of LLMs by integrating symbolic AI techniques effectively.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate solving complex mathematical optimization problems by leveraging machine learning and creating a standardized dataset for such tasks.

Method: Development of AutoOpt-11k, a labeled dataset, and the AutoOpt framework comprising three modules: image-to-text conversion (MER model), text-to-text conversion (fine-tuned LLM), and optimization solving (BOBD method).

Result: AutoOpt framework showed superior performance with its MER model surpassing major benchmarks (ChatGPT, Gemini, Nougat), while the optimization module demonstrated better efficacy compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The dataset and automation framework enhance solving complex mathematical optimization problems with improved accuracy and efficiency via machine learning tools.

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

*Yuxuan Yang,Hussein Sibai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to train neural control barrier functions (CBFs) for ensuring safety in autonomous systems using imitation-constrained learning to label states as safe or unsafe and achieve performance comparable to ground-truth safety labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of specifying failure states formally for safety-critical systems, particularly in scenarios where expert demonstrations are easier to generate than precise failure set definitions.

Method: The authors use imitation-constrained learning (ICL) to classify states into safe and unsafe categories based on expert demonstrations, leveraging this classification to train a neural control barrier function (CBF) with labeled simulated trajectories.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines in four environments and matches the performance of neural CBFs trained with ground-truth labels, validating its efficacy.

Conclusion: This data-driven labeling method provides a practical and effective alternative to expensive optimization-based synthesis for ensuring safety in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

### [28] [Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver via Mixture of Specialized Experts under State-Decomposable MDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21453)
*Yuxin Pan,Zhiguang Cao,Chengyang Gu,Liu Liu,Peilin Zhao,Yize Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoSES, a framework that leverages specialized basis solvers and a State-Decomposable MDP to enhance neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs), achieving improved performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-task VRPs fail to exploit the compositional structure of VRP variants, leading to inefficiencies and lack of optimal solutions for diverse tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) to reformulate VRPs, alongside a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension that utilizes optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function. MoSES is implemented using specialized LoRA experts and adaptive gating mechanisms.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that MoSES outperforms existing neural methods across various VRP variants.

Conclusion: The framework successfully exploits the shared-component nature of VRP variants, overcoming limitations of unified solvers by reusing optimized basis policies and enabling scalable and effective solutions.

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

*Ilija Lichkovski,Alexander Müller,Mariam Ibrahim,Tiwai Mhundwa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EU-Agent-Bench, a benchmark to measure LLM agents' compliance with EU legal norms across different categories using human-curated scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the unpredictable and potentially unsafe actions of LLM agents by assessing their alignment with EU legal norms in realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark with compliant and non-compliant user requests, grounded in EU legislature, compared LLM model outputs to a curated rubric, and studied the impact of legislative excerpts in system prompts.

Result: The benchmark reveals varying levels of legal compliance among frontier LLMs, showcasing the effect of explicitly instructing compliance with EU norms.

Conclusion: This work introduces a significant agentic safety benchmark, encourages extending such measures to different jurisdictions, and provides resources for further research in safely aligning AI agents with legal norms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-Sight improves long-horizon reasoning in LLMs using mechanisms for verification and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the failure of long-horizon reasoning in LLMs caused by insufficient intermediate reasoning verification.

Method: The proposed method involves Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) to target inconsistencies and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF) to build auditable and synced reasoning.

Result: The paper reports state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%), Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%).

Conclusion: The approach ensures scalable, efficient, and reliable reasoning for LLM-based agents with traceable, verified methods.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

*Wenyi Wang,Piotr Piękos,Li Nanbo,Firas Laakom,Yimeng Chen,Mateusz Ostaszewski,Mingchen Zhuge,Jürgen Schmidhuber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a mismatch in coding agents optimizing self-improvement, introduces a metric to address it, and proposes the Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM), leading to improved efficiency and human-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch in self-improving coding agents and improve their ability to self-optimize effectively.

Method: The authors introduce a metric called CMP to aggregate the potential for self-improvement based on descendants' performance and develop the Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM) to guide its self-modifications.

Result: HGM achieves better performance compared to previous methods, uses less computational time, transfers effectively to new datasets, and reaches human-level performance on coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: HGM, guided by CMP, offers an efficient method for coding agents to self-improve, achieving promising benchmark results and transferability across datasets.

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

*Xiaoxi Li,Wenxiang Jiao,Jiarui Jin,Guanting Dong,Jiajie Jin,Yinuo Wang,Hao Wang,Yutao Zhu,Ji-Rong Wen,Yuan Lu,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepAgent is a powerful end-to-end reasoning agent that autonomously performs thinking, tool discovery, and action execution. It addresses challenges such as interaction history explosion using memory folding and reinforces tool usage via a targeted strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models face limitations in handling complex, long-horizon interactions and adapting autonomously to tool discovery and usage.

Method: DeepAgent leverages an autonomous memory folding system to compress interaction histories and employs a reinforcement learning strategy (ToolPO) for efficient tool invocation training using simulated APIs.

Result: Experimental results on eight benchmarks show DeepAgent outperforming baseline models in tasks involving both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Conclusion: DeepAgent advances the development of general-purpose agents capable of handling real-world applications and provides its methodology for public use and experimentation.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

TL;DR: The paper introduces AstaBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating AI agents' abilities to assist in scientific research, highlighting existing deficiencies in agent evaluation and providing tools and agents for holistic and reproducible testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing benchmarks for evaluating AI agents' capability in assisting scientific research, ensuring rigorous and controlled assessment of their abilities.

Method: Development of AstaBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite with 2400+ problems spanning various domains of scientific discovery, inclusion of production-grade tools for reproducible testing, and provision of baseline agents for comparison.

Result: AstaBench allows holistic and controlled evaluation of AI agents in scientific research. Extensive tests revealed meaningful progress on specific tasks but highlighted the overall limitations of AI in effectively assisting scientific research.

Conclusion: AI has made progress in assisting scientific research, yet remains far from achieving comprehensive capabilities in this domain. AstaBench is a critical tool for advancing and evaluating such efforts.

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMOMgen, a novel strategy for complex multi-ontology matching to enhance semantic integration across ontologies. It achieves competitive performance across biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of pairwise ontology matching and enhance semantic integration by establishing nuanced equivalences between entities across multiple ontologies.

Method: The method involves CMOMgen, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach leveraging In-Context Learning for selecting relevant classes and composing mappings without restrictions on target ontologies or entities.

Result: CMOMgen surpasses baselines with a minimum 63% F1-score and demonstrates significant improvements in class selection and mapping quality. Manual evaluation confirms 46% of non-reference mappings achieving maximum scores.

Conclusion: CMOMgen effectively generates semantically sound mappings for complex multi-ontology matching, demonstrating its potential in biomedical ontology integration.

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

*Gaku Morio,Harri Rowlands,Dominik Stammbach,Christopher D. Manning,Peter Henderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for analyzing public relations video ads using vision-language models (VLMs), focusing on framing insights in the energy sector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Companies use public relations to enhance their brand image, but these efforts may involve mismatches between their actions and communications, such as 'greenwashing.' Understanding the framing in these campaigns can provide insights into their strategies.

Method: The authors created a dataset with 13 framing types through expert annotations of video ads from over 50 companies worldwide. They evaluated the effectiveness of vision-language models on this dataset.

Result: The study shows GPT-4.1 achieving 79% F1 score in detecting environmental messages, but reveals challenges such as implicit framing and cultural complexities. Current VLMs offer promising, yet limited performance.

Conclusion: The dataset advances research in the strategic communication analysis of the energy sector and emphasizes the need for improvement in VLMs to address implicit and nuanced framing in multimodal data.

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using a Knowledge Graph (KG) to bridge the gap between high-level missions and low-level planner inputs, enabling adaptive coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs hinders effective coordination of autonomous agents.

Method: The authors propose a Knowledge Graph with a two-plane architecture to compile declarative facts into mission-aware worldviews and traversal rules, facilitating domain-agnostic path planning.

Result: A case study with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) demonstrates the end-to-end process and shows that different declarative policies yield distinct and high-performing outcomes.

Conclusion: The Knowledge Graph acts as both a data repository and a versatile orchestrator for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

*Stefan Abi-Karam,Rishov Sarkar,Suhail Basalama,Jason Cong,Callie Hao*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: FIFOAdvisor is a framework for optimizing FIFO sizes in FPGA designs using a cycle-accurate simulator (LightningSim) for efficient analysis and runtime-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correctly sizing FIFO buffers in FPGA implementations is challenging due to the need to balance latency and memory usage while avoiding deadlocks and stalls.

Method: The authors developed FIFOAdvisor, integrating a fast simulator (LightningSim) and black-box optimization methods to determine FIFO sizes in HLS FPGA designs optimized for both latency and memory.

Result: Evaluation on benchmarks shows FIFOAdvisor enables significant reductions in memory usage with minimal delay overhead and offers runtime speedups, making it practical for design space exploration.

Conclusion: FIFOAdvisor proves efficient in optimizing FIFO sizes, achieving Pareto-optimal results across latency and memory trade-offs, and is applicable to complex FPGA accelerators.

Abstract: Dataflow hardware designs enable efficient FPGA implementations via
high-level synthesis (HLS), but correctly sizing first-in-first-out (FIFO)
channel buffers remains challenging. FIFO sizes are user-defined and balance
latency and area-undersized FIFOs cause stalls and potential deadlocks, while
oversized ones waste memory. Determining optimal sizes is non-trivial: existing
methods rely on restrictive assumptions, conservative over-allocation, or slow
RTL simulations. We emphasize that runtime-based analyses (i.e., simulation)
are the only reliable way to ensure deadlock-free FIFO optimization for
data-dependent designs.
  We present FIFOAdvisor, a framework that automatically determines FIFO sizes
in HLS designs. It leverages LightningSim, a 99.9\% cycle-accurate simulator
supporting millisecond-scale incremental runs with new FIFO configurations.
FIFO sizing is formulated as a dual-objective black-box optimization problem,
and we explore heuristic and search-based methods to characterize the
latency-resource trade-off. FIFOAdvisor also integrates with Stream-HLS, a
framework for optimizing affine dataflow designs lowered from C++, MLIR, or
PyTorch, enabling deeper optimization of FIFOs in these workloads.
  We evaluate FIFOAdvisor on Stream-HLS design benchmarks spanning linear
algebra and deep learning workloads. Our results reveal Pareto-optimal
latency-memory frontiers across optimization strategies. Compared to baseline
designs, FIFOAdvisor achieves much lower memory usage with minimal delay
overhead. Additionally, it delivers significant runtime speedups over
traditional HLS/RTL co-simulation, making it practical for rapid design space
exploration. We further demonstrate its capability on a complex accelerator
with data-dependent control flow.

Motivation: To address the need for area and delay optimization in LUT-based multipliers used in IoT and edge inference for parallel low-bitwidth operations.

Method: The paper reorganizes logic functions in LUTs to create a hardware-efficient multiplier using 11 LUTs and 2 CARRY4 blocks, reducing LUT usage and shortening the critical path.

Result: The proposed multiplier achieves minimal resource usage and lowers the critical-path delay to 2.750 ns compared to a 12-LUT design.

Conclusion: The design demonstrates significant improvements in hardware efficiency and performance, enabling optimized parallel operations on FPGAs.

Abstract: As IoT and edge inference proliferate,there is a growing need to
simultaneously optimize area and delay in lookup-table (LUT)-based multipliers
that implement large numbers of low-bitwidth operations in parallel. This paper
proposes a hardwareefficientaccurate 4-bit multiplier design for AMD Xilinx
7-series FPGAs using only 11 LUTs and two CARRY4 blocks. By reorganizing the
logic functions mapped to the LUTs, the proposed method reduces the LUT count
by one compared with the prior 12-LUT design while also shortening the critical
path. Evaluation confirms that the circuit attains minimal resource usage and a
critical-path delay of 2.750 ns.

*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmarking and enhancement method for language model agents to improve their information-seeking performance in scenarios requiring rational decision-making. They use tasks like Collaborative Battleship and Guess Who? to demonstrate advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the rationality of language models in high-stakes applications like diagnostics or scientific hypotheses formation, where efficient information-seeking and decision-making are crucial.

Method: The researchers designed tasks (e.g., Collaborative Battleship, Guess Who?) and introduced Monte Carlo inference strategies based on Bayesian Experimental Design principles to evaluate and enhance language model performance.

Result: Their methodology leads to significant improvements in accuracy (spotters: +14.7%, captains: EIG +0.227 bits), targeting (F1 +0.303-0.374), and game outcomes (win rates against humans and advanced models), demonstrating superiority even for weaker LMs.

Conclusion: The study provides a generalizable approach to advancing rational information-seeking capabilities of language models, enabling them to surpass human and high-end AI performance in structured decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt improves standard instruct LMs' reasoning abilities to surpass corresponding RMs using natural language and code execution without requiring finetuning, outperforming in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores alternatives to reasoning models (RMs) using instruct language models (LMs) to address the computational and cost demands of RMs, aiming for comparable or better performance with fewer resources.

Method: CodeAdapt combines CodeAct for multi-step reasoning with code execution and few-shot in-context learning using minimal training problems.

Result: CodeAdapt empowers LMs to outperform RMs across diverse tasks, yielding up to 35.7% higher performance on average, while being significantly more token efficient.

Conclusion: CodeAdapt-style reasoning is robust, domain general, and leverages cognitively grounded code-enabled LMs, offering promising foundations for reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FICSIM, a dataset for evaluating language models on long-form fiction similarity, highlighting current model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating language models on literary tasks, given issues with annotation costs and data contamination using public-domain literature.

Method: FICSIM dataset was created with long-form fiction scored across 12 similarity axes, combined with authors' metadata and validation from scholars.

Result: Evaluation of embedding models showed a focus on superficial features, rather than meaningful semantic categories essential for literary studies.

Conclusion: Language models have limitations in processing literary tasks effectively, and FICSIM provides a benchmark while promoting ethical author engagement.

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [43] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to understand long legal documents, particularly through identifying overruling relationships in U.S. Supreme Court cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of realistic benchmarks for evaluating long-context legal reasoning tasks in LLMs, as existing benchmarks often rely on simplistic tasks that do not reflect real-world complexity.

Method: The authors assess LLM performance in identifying overruling relationships from a dataset of 236 U.S. Supreme Court case pairs, analyzing limitations such as temporal bias, shallow reasoning, and context-dependent failures.

Result: The evaluation highlights three main limitations in LLMs: sensitivity to the era of cases (favoring modern over historical ones), reliance on superficial logic rather than legal expertise, and errors in reasoning under complex, context-dependent scenarios.

Conclusion: The study introduces a realistic benchmark for long-context legal reasoning in LLMs, exposing key challenges and suggesting the importance of developing more nuanced models capable of deep and context-aware comprehension.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Irish-BLiMP, a dataset for evaluating linguistic competence in the endangered Irish language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a systematic benchmark for evaluating grammatical competence in the low-resource Irish language, addressing a gap in linguistic understanding frameworks for endangered languages.

Method: The dataset Irish-BLiMP includes 1020 manually constructed minimal pairs across 11 linguistic features, designed by fluent Irish speakers. Evaluations were conducted on Large Language Models (LLMs) and human participants.

Result: Humans outperformed LLMs by 16.6% on average, with the best LLM (gpt-5) achieving 73.5% accuracy compared to 90.1% by humans. Open-source LLMs performed 18.1% worse than closed-source counterparts. Models and humans struggled with different grammatical aspects.

Conclusion: Irish-BLiMP serves as a valuable benchmark for analyzing the grammatical capabilities of LLMs in Irish, offering insights into linguistic challenges and advancing language research for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [45] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores confidence-gated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to selectively invoke reasoning in large language models, aiming to balance task accuracy and efficiency. It evaluates training-free confidence measures for CoT adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and task inconsistency of using CoT in language models by selectively applying reasoning when it is beneficial.

Method: The study evaluates four training-free confidence estimation methods against a random baseline and an oracle to determine their effectiveness in CoT gating.

Result: The methods reduce redundant reasoning and improve task performance compared to random invocation, but their effectiveness varies across datasets and models.

Conclusion: Confidence-gated CoT has potential to improve reasoning efficiency, but the inconsistency of current measures poses challenges, prompting further research for more reliable solutions.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the impact of input structure on factual errors in large language model-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how input data format affects the accuracy of text summaries generated by large language models in sports reporting, addressing concerns of hallucination and factual errors.

Method: The paper compares three input formats (row-structured, JSON, unstructured) by analyzing error rates in game summaries generated by two models, using annotated errors and statistical methods like ANOVA and Tukey HSD.

Result: JSON input significantly reduces error rates (by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen), followed by row-structured input reducing errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for Qwen. Input structure accounts for over 80% variance in error rates.

Conclusion: Input structure dramatically affects error rates in LLM-generated sports summaries, with structured formats like JSON showing the greatest improvements in factual accuracy.

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines reasoning in language models under low false positive rate requirements for classification tasks, revealing trade-offs: reasoning boosts overall accuracy but struggles with strict precision. Combining reasoning and non-reasoning methods improves outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of reasoning for classification tasks that require high precision and low false positive rates, like safety or hallucination detection.

Method: Analysis of reasoning in fine-tuned and zero-shot settings for classification tasks, comparing standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models. Tasks were assessed under different false positive rate conditions.

Result: Reasoning improves overall accuracy but underperforms in precision-sensitive, low-FPR conditions. Token-based scoring surpasses self-verbalized confidence, and combining reasoning and non-reasoning approaches retains strengths of both methods.

Conclusion: Reasoning enhances accuracy but is less suitable for applications requiring strict precision. A hybrid approach combining reasoning and non-reasoning methods is recommended for precision-sensitive tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DR-IKE, a framework for dynamic in-context knowledge editing in large language models (LLMs) to address stale or incorrect information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often propagate stale or incorrect knowledge, and existing in-context editors face limitations like quality-quantity trade-offs and lack of adaptability.

Method: DR-IKE trains a BERT retriever with reinforcement learning to prioritize demonstrations based on editing rewards, uses a learnable threshold for adaptive prompt adjustments, and requires no model weight modifications.

Result: DR-IKE shows improvements on the COUNTERFACT benchmark: 17.1% higher edit success, 41.6% lower latency, while maintaining accuracy on unrelated queries.

Conclusion: DR-IKE offers a scalable solution for dynamic knowledge editing in black-box LLMs, enhancing edit success and efficiency without altering model weights.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an Adaptive RAG system for Indonesian language question answering, showing promise but revealing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve question answering systems for low-resource languages like Indonesian using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Method: Developed an Adaptive RAG system that uses a classifier to evaluate question complexity and applies data augmentation through machine translation due to limited Indonesian datasets.

Result: Reliable performance of question complexity classification but observed inconsistencies and drawbacks in multi-retrieval answering strategies.

Conclusion: The Adaptive RAG system shows potential in bridging language gaps in QA systems, though challenges in strategy consistency indicate areas for improvement in addressing low-resource languages.

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

TL;DR: The study presents CDrugRed, a Chinese drug recommendation dataset for discharge medications related to metabolic diseases, and benchmarks large language models, highlighting the challenge in clinical drug recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of publicly available, real-world electronic health record datasets, especially in languages other than English, to improve intelligent drug recommendation systems for enhanced clinical decision-making.

Method: The authors created CDrugRed, a comprehensive dataset containing 5,894 records from 3,190 patients, and benchmarked the dataset using state-of-the-art large language models for discharge medication recommendation tasks, focusing on metabolic diseases.

Result: Experiments with fine-tuned models showed moderate results, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 0.5648 and a Jaccard score of 0.4477, demonstrating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: CDrugRed presents a valuable resource for drug recommendation research, emphasizing the complexity of clinical decision-making tasks and the need for further advancements in model performance in this domain.

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Rewarding PPO, a new method to improve alignment of large language models (LLMs) using demonstration data. It addresses limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by leveraging proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a self-rewarding mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles with overfitting and poor generalization, especially under limited data scenarios, necessitating better methods for effective alignment of LLMs with human-annotated demonstrations.

Method: The paper proposes Self-Rewarding PPO, where a reward function based on the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model guides on-policy fine-tuning with PPO, enhancing alignment without relying on human preference annotations.

Result: Empirical tests on various NLP tasks demonstrate that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional supervised fine-tuning methods in generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO is an effective method for aligning LLMs using demonstration data, offering better generalization and performance in scenarios with limited high-quality annotated data.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring faithfulness in summaries generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing a new annotation framework and benchmark called VeriGray.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of annotation ambiguity in existing benchmarks, caused by undefined boundaries regarding the use of external knowledge in faithful summaries.

Method: The authors propose a novel annotation framework with an intermediate category called Out-Dependent, and construct a benchmark, VeriGray, for detecting unfaithfulness in summarization tasks.

Result: The study reveals that even advanced models like GPT-5 show hallucinations in 6% of sentences and 8% require external knowledge for verification, highlighting the need for improved benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark expose limitations in current models and present a significant opportunity to resolve annotation ambiguities and improve faithfulness in LLM-generated summaries.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), presenting taxonomy and strategies for mutual enrichment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in structured reasoning and TAGs in semantic depth by combining the strengths of both.

Method: The paper proposes a taxonomy for LLM-TAG integration, categorizing strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks. It explores approaches like TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and fine-tuning.

Result: The integration enhances TAG representation learning, improves LLM reasoning, and is beneficial in applications such as recommendation systems and biomedical analysis.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs and TAGs offers complementary advantages, with outlined challenges and future directions to advance language and graph learning research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

*Ning Bian,Xianpei Han,Hongyu Lin,Baolei Wu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in accurately simulating authentic human behaviors, indicating their susceptibility to social desirability bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the ability of LLMs to emulate genuine human behavior in social contexts and whether discrepancies exist between their simulated behaviors and actual human interactions.

Method: Researchers developed a framework to simulate multi-agent interactions using chatroom-style conversations and analyzed these interactions across five linguistic dimensions, focusing on social cognitive biases.

Result: The study revealed that LLMs fail to reproduce genuine human behavior, instead presenting overly idealized or biased versions shaped by social desirability. Observed biases include social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias.

Conclusion: LLMs create utopian societies that lack real-world human complexity, necessitating advancements to make LLMs more socially grounded and reflective of human diversity in behavior.

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

### [55] [Estonian Native Large Language Model Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21193)
*Helena Grete Lillepalu,Tanel Alumäe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate language models on Estonian tasks, using diverse datasets and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating LLM performance on Estonian language tasks.

Method: Seven diverse native Estonian datasets were designed for evaluation, comparing base models, instruction-tuned models, and commercial models through human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Result: Results showed a strong alignment between human evaluations and LLM judge scores, demonstrating effective benchmarking for Estonian LLMs.

Conclusion: The newly developed Estonian benchmark provides a robust tool to evaluate LLMs and highlights the potential of advanced LLMs for performing assessments in niche languages.

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

*Nishan Chatterjee,Veronika Bajt,Ana Zwitter Vitez,Senja Pollak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines Twitter discourse of far-right supporters focusing on migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques, using advanced natural language processing and sociological analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to understand dissemination of extremist ideologies and their effects on politics, especially in the context of rising right-wing populism in Europe.

Method: It uses state-of-the-art natural language processing and sociological insights to analyze a corpus of far-right tweets (MIGR-TWIT) in English and French.

Result: The methodology uncovers discourse patterns among far-right supporters relating to migration, hate speech, and persuasion strategies.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the value of combining linguistic, sociological, and computational methods to understand social media's role in spreading extremist ideologies and addressing societal challenges from right-wing extremism.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study developed and evaluated an AI-powered system for simulating emergency medical dispatch scenarios, achieving high performance and clinical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load in emergency medical dispatch processes.

Method: Developed a taxonomy-grounded LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (MAS) using clinical taxonomy, a six-phase call protocol, and simulation via AutoGen-based Caller and Dispatcher Agents, evaluated by physicians and linguistic analysis.

Result: System performed well in guidance efficacy (91%) and dispatch effectiveness (94%), confirmed by physicians and algorithmic metrics including neutral sentiment, high readability, and politeness.

Conclusion: The MAS is effective for dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and potentially for real-time emergency response decision support.

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

### [58] [Correlation Dimension of Auto-Regressive Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21258)
*Xin Du,Kumiko Tanaka-Ishii*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure to analyze text complexity in large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations of current evaluation metrics in capturing structural complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional evaluation metrics for LLMs focus on local prediction accuracy but fail to account for long-range structural complexity, leading to issues like repetition and incoherence in text generation.

Method: The authors propose correlation dimension as a measure of self-similarity to assess the epistemological complexity of text generated by LLMs. They conduct extensive experiments to validate its effectiveness.

Result: The study finds that correlation dimension reveals three phases of pretraining, reflects context-dependent complexity, indicates hallucination tendencies, and detects text degeneration. The method is computationally efficient and robust.

Conclusion: Correlation dimension provides a unified framework to evaluate generative dynamics of LLMs, offering insights into their text coherence and self-similarity, addressing prior limitations in evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

### [59] [Sparser Block-Sparse Attention via Token Permutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21270)
*Xinghao Wang,Pengyu Wang,Dong Zhang,Chenkun Tan,Shaojun Zhou,Zhaoxiang Liu,Shiguo Lian,Fangxu Liu,Kai Song,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (PBS-Attn), a method to optimize computational efficiency in large language models by improving block-level sparsity in attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling context length in large language models is computationally expensive due to the self-attention mechanism's complexity, which grows quadratically with sequence length. Current solutions like block-sparse attention still have inefficiencies due to sub-optimal attention patterns.

Method: The paper proposes PBS-Attn, which uses permutation properties in attention to enhance block-level sparsity, thereby reducing computational redundancy. It uses custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels to achieve speed and efficiency.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on long-context datasets show that PBS-Attn improves model accuracy, performs better than existing methods, and closely matches the accuracy of full attention. It achieves up to 2.75x speedup in prefilling tasks.

Conclusion: PBS-Attn offers a practical and efficient solution for optimizing computational resources in LLMs, making it viable for real-world applications with long context lengths. The approach advances the state-of-the-art in sparse attention methods while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

### [60] [PARL: Prompt-based Agents for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21306)
*Yarik Menchaca Resendiz,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PARL, a method that uses large language models (LLMs) as reinforcement learning (RL) agents via prompting, without fine-tuning. It evaluates performance on structured RL tasks beyond natural language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) as agents in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, moving beyond supervised and unsupervised tasks limited to natural language interactions.

Method: Introduces PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), which prompts LLMs to interact with RL tasks by encoding actions, states, and rewards without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: PARL demonstrates comparable or superior performance to traditional RL agents in simple environments but underperforms in tasks involving complex calculations or decoding operations.

Conclusion: LLMs, through prompting, can be effective RL agents in simpler, structured tasks leveraging pretrained knowledge but have limitations in handling complex reasoning or math-based RL environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

### [61] [Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310)
*Ji Won Park,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve uncertainty estimations in large language models for free-form question answering using diversity-steered sampling and semantic penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in free-form question answering using LLMs is costly and complex, requiring stable and sample-efficient techniques.

Method: The paper introduces a diversity-steered sampler that uses semantic-similarity penalties via a finetuned NLI model and employs importance reweighting and control variates to improve uncertainty estimates.

Result: The proposed method matches or surpasses baseline methods in uncertainty estimation efficiency while achieving better semantic diversity across four QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: This modular framework offers a sample-efficient and gradient-free enhancement for uncertainty estimation, which can aid risk-sensitive LLM deployments.

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

### [62] [Typoglycemia under the Hood: Investigating Language Models' Understanding of Scrambled Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21326)
*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates why NLP models like BERT perform well under typoglycemia (reading scrambled words).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how NLP models, like BERT, can handle internally scrambled words effectively despite the potential for word ambiguity.

Method: Analyzed the British National Corpus to quantify word collapses, tested BERT's ability to disambiguate scrambled words, and conducted experiments training BERT on both clean and typoglycemic text data.

Result: Findings indicate relatively few English words collapse under typoglycemia and context aids in disambiguation. Performance degradation linked to word scrambling was smaller than anticipated.

Conclusion: Contextual cues and limited word collapse explain NLP robustness to typoglycemia, with models exhibiting surprising resilience to scrambled text.

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

*Priyanshu Karmakar,Soumyabrata Chaudhuri,Shubhojit Mallick,Manish Gupta,Abhik Jana,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide introduces a benchmark to assess how well Large Language Models (LLMs) adapt travel itineraries under disruptions, using automatic metrics, LLM-based judgment, and expert evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for evaluating LLMs in revising travel plans facing realistic disruptions like cancellations or closures.

Method: Three evaluation techniques: automated metrics (intent preservation, responsiveness, adaptability), LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, and manual expert reviews.

Result: LLMs show strong sequential and semantic consistency but struggle with spatial coherence in short trips. Disruption-handling worsens as trip length increases.

Conclusion: TripTide is a benchmark framework that highlights adaptability challenges and resilience limits of LLMs in personalized travel planning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

*Qiang Liu,Wuganjing Song,Zhenzhou Lin,Feifan Chen,Qiaolong Cai,Chen Li,Yongduo Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the need for multi-turn training with human feedback in reasoning tasks and finds that single-turn training is more effective and reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training paradigms for Large Language Models rely on single-turn reinforcement learning, which might conflict with real-world scenarios that typically involve multi-turn interactions.

Method: The study compares single-turn training against three multi-turn strategies, analyzing their effectiveness in reasoning tasks.

Result: Single-turn training generalizes well to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, whereas multi-turn approaches degrade single-turn reasoning performance.

Conclusion: For reasoning tasks with complete information, single-turn training proves to be more robust and effective than multi-turn training, which provides limited benefits and might compromise reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

*Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors introduce a Swedish-specific question-answering benchmark targeting Swedish cultural and historical knowledge, and discuss its use for evaluating multilingual language models' factual recall and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to address the gap in Swedish-specific benchmarks, as many existing ones are translations of US-centric datasets, and therefore lack relevance to Swedish culture, personalities, and events.

Method: A manually written question-answering benchmark was developed, inspired by Swedish public figures and sports events, including English translations to also assess cross-lingual factual consistency.

Result: Smaller models with better Swedish coverage perform comparably to larger multilingual models when recalling Sweden-related facts. However, continued pre-training in Swedish improves overall Swedish-specific knowledge but causes forgetting of some previously known information.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for studying multilingual models' language adaptation, knowledge retention, and their ability to recall culturally specific facts.

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

TL;DR: SindBERT introduces large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder models specifically for Turkish, showing competitive performance across benchmarks and emphasizing corpus composition's importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underrepresentation of morphologically rich languages, specifically Turkish, in large-scale pre-trained transformer models.

Method: The authors trained SindBERT from scratch on 312 GB of Turkish text, offering both base and large configurations while evaluating the models on diverse NLP tasks and benchmarks.

Result: SindBERT performs competitively against existing Turkish and multilingual models, achieving leading results in some tasks but revealing limitations in scaling advantage due to benchmark saturation.

Conclusion: SindBERT serves as an essential Turkish NLP resource and highlights the impact of corpus quality and diversity over sheer data volume for morphologically rich languages.

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the potential of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in improving human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning models.

Method: The authors created a descriptive caption dataset and developed evaluation methods to assess VLMs' performance in human activity recognition. Comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art deep learning models were conducted.

Result: The paper shows that VLMs perform comparably, and even surpass traditional deep learning approaches in accuracy for human activity recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights the promise of VLMs in healthcare, providing a benchmark and enabling their integration into intelligent healthcare systems for remote monitoring.

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

### [69] [Redefining Retrieval Evaluation in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21440)
*Giovanni Trappolini,Florin Cuconasu,Simone Filice,Yoelle Maarek,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing IR metrics like nDCG, MAP, and MRR fail to align with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems because these metrics assume human sequential examination instead of holistic processing by LLMs. The authors propose a new metric, UDCG, which accounts for both position discount and negative effects of irrelevant documents on LLMs, improving correlation with answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the misalignment between traditional IR metrics and Retrieval Augmented Generation systems. IR metrics fail to reflect the utility of retrieved documents when consumed by LLMs, as these metrics assume sequential human consumption and ignore the negative impact of distractors, which reduces their relevance in RAG evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce a utility-based annotation system that evaluates the positive contribution of relevant documents and the distractions caused by irrelevant ones. They then propose UDCG, a new metric that integrates LLM-specific positional discounts to measure end-to-end system performance.

Result: UDCG, tested on five datasets and six LLMs, improves the correlation between the metric and RAG system performance by up to 36% compared to traditional IR metrics, ensuring more accurate evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed UDCG provides a more accurate and LLM-aligned measure of RAG system performance, bridging the gap between IR metrics and machine consumption scenarios. This allows for better assessment and optimization of retrieval components in generative systems, advancing the field.

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

*Thanh Cong Ho,Farah Kharrat,Abderrazek Abid,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces REMONI, an autonomous remote health monitoring system using multimodal large language models, IoT, and wearable devices to gather patient data, detect anomalies, and support healthcare providers through natural language interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better human-machine interaction in remote patient monitoring systems due to the popularity of wearable devices and the current research focus on specific diseases.

Method: REMONI integrates multimodal large language models, IoT, and wearable devices to collect and process patient vital signs, activities, moods, and emergencies, leveraging natural language processing for user interaction.

Result: REMONI's prototype demonstrates its scalability, real-life applicability, and reduction of workloads and costs in healthcare.

Conclusion: REMONI successfully showcases a robust, interactive system for remote patient monitoring that aids healthcare professionals and can be implemented efficiently.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

*Chenglong Wang,Yang Gan,Hang Zhou,Chi Hu,Yongyu Mu,Kai Song,Murun Yang,Bei Li,Chunliang Zhang,Tongran Liu,Jingbo Zhu,Zhengtao Yu,Tong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Reward Optimization approach to enhance token correlation in diffusion language models for improved reasoning performance and faster sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Language Models are promising but lag behind autoregressive models in reasoning, primarily due to independent masked token generation.

Method: Introduces Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) using test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning, with group step and importance sampling for efficiency.

Result: MRO enhances reasoning abilities, improves sampling speed, and maintains robust performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Optimizing token correlation in DLMs is crucial for better reasoning performance, and the MRO approach presents an effective solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

### [72] [Brain-tuning Improves Generalizability and Efficiency of Brain Alignment in Speech Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21520)
*Omer Moussa,Mariya Toneva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable, generalizable method for fine-tuning pretrained language models to predict fMRI brain responses from multiple participants, achieving improved brain alignment and reduced data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses limitations in current brain alignment methods for pretrained language models, such as participant-dependent results and high data demands, which hinder generalization and population-level analyses.

Method: The authors introduce a brain-tuning technique that fine-tunes pretrained models to predict fMRI responses jointly for multiple participants, enhancing scalability and generalization.

Result: The brain-tuned models require 5x less fMRI data for new participants, improve brain alignment by 50%, exhibit strong generalization across datasets, and enhance performance on semantic tasks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates mutual benefits between neuroscience and AI, enhancing brain alignment for language models and improving semantic representation generalizability.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

*Likun Tan,Kuan-Wei Huang,Joy Shi,Kevin Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination issues in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, analyzing its causes and proposing a novel detection methodology using mechanistic signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to effectively identify and mitigate hallucinations in RAG models by understanding the interplay between external retrieved content and parametric knowledge.

Method: The approach involves analyzing RAG hallucinations by computing external context scores and parametric knowledge scores across layers and attention heads of the model to train regression-based classifiers.

Result: The proposed method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art LLMs and detection baselines. The classifiers trained on one model (Qwen3-0.6b) efficiently predict hallucinations in other systems (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini).

Conclusion: Mechanistic signals are highlighted as effective and generalizable tools for hallucination detection in modern RAG systems, paving the way for robust evaluations across diverse models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

*Jared Claypoole,Yunye Gong,Noson S. Yanofsky,Ajay Divakaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a category-theory-based framework for analyzing and extending the structure and content of documents using mathematical representations, leading to advanced summarization, information measures, and self-supervised model enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a formal and mathematical framework to better understand, measure, and enhance the structure and information within multimodal documents and improve large pretrained models.

Method: The authors utilize category theory to model documents as collections of question-answer pairs, orthogonalize information into distinct pieces, and propose novel summarization and document extension techniques. They also leverage large pretrained models and propose a self-supervised method for model improvement using reinforced consistency constraints.

Result: The study introduces tools to measure and enumerate document information, new summarization and exegesis techniques, rate-distortion analysis for summarization, and a self-supervised learning framework to enhance pretrained models using category-theoretic properties.

Conclusion: The proposed category-theoretic methodology provides a foundational approach for document structure analysis, summarization, and model enhancement, offering practical tools and theoretical insights that extend multimodal document capabilities.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

### [75] [Are the LLMs Capable of Maintaining at Least the Language Genus?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21561)
*Sandra Mitrović,David Kletz,Ljiljana Dolamic,Fabio Rinaldi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how language structure affects the multilingual behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs), finding that while models show some sensitivity to linguistic genera, data availability drives their performance the most.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify if and how genealogical linguistic structures influence the multilingual performance and behavior of Large Language Models.

Method: The study analyzed the MultiQ dataset to examine if LLMs prefer related languages when the prompt language changes and assessed knowledge consistency within and across linguistic genera.

Result: It was found that LLMs exhibit some sensitivity to linguistic genera, but their performance is primarily influenced by the availability of training resources. Varying multilingual strategies were identified across different LLM families.

Conclusion: LLMs are somewhat aware of linguistic structures at the genus level, but imbalanced training data is the dominant factor shaping their multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

*Mojca Brglez,Špela Vintar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first pragmatics understanding benchmarks for Slovene, highlighting the evaluation of language understanding beyond syntax and semantics, detailing translation challenges, human baseline establishment, and pilot evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models excel in syntax and semantics but often struggle with nuanced pragmatics, creating the need for evaluations targeting situational and culture-specific language understanding.

Method: The researchers introduced SloPragEval and SloPragMega, pragmatics benchmarks with 405 multiple-choice questions. They detailed translation challenges, established human baselines, and conducted pilot evaluations with LLMs.

Result: Results show improvement in nuanced language understanding by current LLMs but highlight their weakness in inferring implied meanings in non-literal, culture-specific utterances. A performance gap exists between proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: Benchmarks for nuanced language understanding must focus on native data and include human validation, ensuring proper representation of linguistic and cultural complexities.

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses transcription errors and undocumented borrowings in language documentation by introducing unsupervised anomaly detection methods for phonotactic inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transcription errors and borrowings can cause misleading linguistic analysis in lexical data documentation, affecting the reliability of language study.

Method: Unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms using character-level and syllable-level phonotactic features are applied to multilingual datasets to flag potential inconsistencies.

Result: Syllable-aware features outperform character-level baselines in detecting anomalies, improving the systematic identification of errors or borrowings.

Conclusion: The method aids fieldworkers in verifying data entries, enhancing the quality of documentation for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic
analysis. We present unsupervised anomaly detection methods to identify
phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language
documentation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated in stock movement prediction, showing limitations in reasoning and susceptibility to contextual opinions. A novel method, Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), enhances reasoning and prediction abilities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the application of LLMs for stock movement prediction, addressing existing limitations in reasoning and reliance on contextual viewpoints.

Method: Proposed RETuning, which involves constructing analytical frameworks, organizing and scoring evidence dynamically, and reflecting for independent reasoning to predict stock movements.

Result: RETuning enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities and prediction accuracy in financial tasks, demonstrated with a large-scale dataset of A-share stocks.

Conclusion: RETuning unlocks valuable insights in stock movement prediction, with models displaying robust performance over time and across diverse stocks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theories and models struggle to provide a unified, quantitative framework for understanding the dynamics of human reasoning.

Method: IF-Track utilizes LLMs as probabilistic encoders to measure information entropy and gain across reasoning steps.

Result: It successfully models universal human reasoning dynamics, identifies errors, characterizes individual differences, and aligns artificial and human cognition.

Conclusion: IF-Track bridges psychological theory with quantitative measurement, offering insights into reasoning processes and reshaping understanding of human cognition with AI.

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses how adapters for text-to-image generators often entangle target attributes with confounding factors. To resolve this, confounding shortcuts are introduced during training and removed in inference, refining generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of adapter-based training in text-to-image synthesis arises from entanglement of desired attributes with incidental ones, harming generalization and text prompt adherence.

Method: Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training involves routing confounding factors through auxiliary modules during training to prevent entanglement. These modules are removed during inference.

Result: The approach enhances generation quality, diversity, and adherence to text prompts in tasks involving facial and body identity injection.

Conclusion: Disentangling representations in large models can benefit from creating shortcuts for features that should not be learned, leading to improved outcomes.

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new approach for semantic-controlled video generation that uses a reference video as a prompt to guide video creation via robust architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving unified and generalizable semantic control in video generation.

Method: The authors propose VAP, which uses a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer with Mixture-of-Transformers experts, along with temporally biased position embeddings. They also introduce VAP-Data, a large dataset comprising over 100K paired videos for semantic-controlled generation.

Result: VAP achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 38.7% user preference rate, comparable to commercial models, and showcases strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: VAP represents a breakthrough in controllable video generation, providing a unified model with exceptional generalization capabilities and laying the groundwork for future research through the VAP-Data dataset.

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FM-BFF-Net, a novel medical image segmentation network combining CNNs and transformers for improved segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning; however, traditional CNNs struggle with capturing global contextual information and handling structures with complex boundaries.

Method: The proposed FM-BFF-Net integrates convolutional and transformer architectures, employing a focal modulation attention mechanism and bidirectional feature fusion module to enhance context awareness and encoder-decoder interactions.

Result: FM-BFF-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on eight public datasets, improving boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion characteristics.

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net is a promising solution for diverse medical image segmentation tasks, offering superior accuracy and adaptability through innovative architectural design.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT introduces a generative framework for multi-modal point trajectory tracking in videos, especially under uncertainty caused by occlusions and appearance changes, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in occluded tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative point tracking models fail to capture multi-modal trajectory uncertainty, limiting their effectiveness under occlusions.

Method: The model employs a novel flow matching formulation incorporating iterative refinement, a window-dependent prior, and a point-coordinate-specific variance schedule, alongside a best-first search strategy during inference.

Result: GenPT achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy for occluded points and remains competitive on visible points across several benchmarks, including a new variant of TAP-Vid.

Conclusion: By capturing trajectory multi-modality, GenPT significantly enhances tracking accuracy under challenging conditions like occlusions, while remaining robust on standard tasks.

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

Result: The model achieved a 78% detection accuracy, improving 2.5% over YOLOv11n and 13.7% over YOLOv8, with stronger performance in precision-recall and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: EH-YOLOv11n offers a high-accuracy, real-time solution for automated placental abruption diagnosis, with significant potential in clinical applications.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack capabilities to perform grounded anatomical reasoning in 3D medical images. The authors introduce 3DReasonKnee, a new dataset offering expert-annotated examples to improve this aspect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing VLMs in handling grounded reasoning tasks involving anatomical regions in 3D medical images, which is crucial for practical diagnostic workflows and trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration.

Method: The authors developed 3DReasonKnee, a dataset comprising 494k high-quality quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes localized anatomical regions, diagnostic reasoning steps, and severity assessments devised through extensive clinician expertise.

Result: The dataset highlights the inadequacies of current VLMs in managing localized diagnostic assessments and provides structured benchmarks via ReasonKnee-Bench. Five state-of-the-art models were benchmarked for their performance on these tasks.

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee offers a critical tool for improving VLMs' grounded reasoning and decision-making capabilities in medical diagnostics, paving the way for robust multimodal medical AI systems.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D shape reconstruction have limitations in illumination and material-dependent scenarios, necessitating an alternative approach.

Method: The study utilizes long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging to overcome ambiguities in visible polarization analyses and formulates a theoretical framework for this observation.

Result: The method reconstructs detailed 3D shapes of transparent, translucent, and heterogeneous objects with higher accuracy compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances 3D reconstruction technology by leveraging LWIR polarimetric imaging, providing an alternative that is robust under varied conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VESSA, a self-supervised fine-tuning method for adapting vision foundation models to new domains using multi-view object-centric videos without annotations, improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models underperform in domains with distribution shifts and limited annotated data, necessitating a method to adapt them to new domains effectively.

Method: The authors propose VESSA, utilizing self-supervised fine-tuning via self-distillation with multi-view object observations from short, object-centric videos. It ensures pretrained knowledge retention and adapts models efficiently.

Result: Experiments on 3 vision foundation models across 2 datasets showcase consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks using VESSA compared to base models and prior adaptation techniques.

Conclusion: VESSA offers a novel, annotation-free strategy for adapting visual foundation models, leveraging object-centric multi-view videos for enhanced robustness and improved task performance, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved pipeline for 2D detection of unseen objects in industrial settings to enhance 6D pose estimation, addressing challenges such as clutter, poor lighting, and complex backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve robot manipulation by enhancing the accuracy of 6D pose estimation, which suffers in industrial environments due to challenging conditions affecting detection pipelines.

Method: The method involves using an enhanced pipeline with image enhancement, background removal, and open-vocabulary detection using foundation models to suppress false positives and improve detection reliability.

Result: Experiments on industrial bin-picking benchmarks demonstrate significantly improved detection accuracy with negligible inference overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively boosts detection performance for downstream pose estimation in industrial environments, proving its practicality.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning approach to assess post-earthquake structural damage by detecting exposed steel reinforcement in concrete structures using YOLO models and hybrid frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure public safety and aid emergency response by rapidly and reliably assessing structural damage after earthquakes.

Method: The researchers used a YOLOv11 deep learning model trained on labeled image datasets from the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes, incorporating fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. This model was further developed into a hybrid framework for automated damage detection and classification of structural components and damage levels.

Result: The framework was successful in automatically identifying and categorizing structural damage levels, demonstrating its utility in diverse damage scenarios.

Conclusion: This research showcases the potential for automated and effective post-disaster structural damage assessment using deep learning techniques, which can aid in timely decision-making after earthquakes.

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZING-3D, a framework for zero-shot, open-vocabulary recognition and semantic representation in 3D spaces using pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current works on 3D scene graph generation have limitations such as lack of geometric grounding, inability for incremental updates, and confinement to single-view settings, which hinder their application in embodied scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes leveraging pre-trained foundation models and visual language model (VLM) reasoning to create 2D scene graphs with semantic and spatial information, grounding them in 3D using depth data. Nodes and edges capture object features, spatial/semantic relations, and inter-object distances.

Result: Experiments on Replica and HM3D datasets demonstrate ZING-3D's effectiveness in capturing spatial and relational knowledge without the need for task-specific training.

Conclusion: ZING-3D enables structured 3D scene representations with open-vocabulary recognition, geometric grounding, and incremental updates, making it suitable for robotics applications.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WaveSeg, a novel decoder architecture for semantic segmentation focused on refining spatial and wavelet domain features simultaneously. It achieves superior segmentation performance by enhancing boundary details and semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation networks often rely on powerful encoders but simplistic decoders, leading to degraded trade-offs between semantic context and boundary detail preservation.

Method: WaveSeg uses wavelet-domain frequency priors and spatial features, applying a Dual Domain Operation fusion mechanism and Spectrum Decomposition Attention block for detailed modeling of high-frequency components, complemented by reparameterized convolutions for low-frequency semantic preservation.

Result: WaveSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, delivering efficient, precise, and high-quality segmentation results both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: WaveSeg resolves the traditional decoder shortcomings in semantic segmentation, effectively balancing semantic and boundary detail preservation using combined spatial and wavelet domain optimizations.

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis through a novel AI model that uses text-based expert concepts with visual features for tissue analysis, outperforming CNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models, while effective for Hirschsprung's disease diagnosis, often lack interpretability and alignment with physician decision-making. This study aims to integrate expert knowledge into AI models for improved clinical relevance.

Method: The framework incorporates text prompts derived from expert sources into a vision-language model (CLIP and QuiltNet). This multimodal approach uses visual cues and semantic alignment through clinically relevant prompts.

Result: The proposed model surpassed traditional CNN models (VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) with an accuracy of 83.9%, precision of 86.6%, and specificity of 87.6% in myenteric plexus classification.

Conclusion: Multi-modal learning frameworks with expert-driven inputs can enhance histopathological AI models, leading to more interpretable and clinically relevant results in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease.

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HistRetinex, a fast, histogram-based Retinex model for enhancing low-light images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Retinex-based image enhancement methods perform excellently but their efficiency decreases significantly for large-sized images.

Method: The paper develops a histogram-based Retinex model by defining histogram matrices, constructing a two-level optimization model, and using iterative formulas for illumination and reflectance histograms, followed by histogram matching for enhancement.

Result: HistRetinex provides superior enhancement visibility and metrics compared to existing methods while operating faster with a processing time of 1.86 seconds for large images.

Conclusion: HistRetinex proves to be an efficient and effective low-light image enhancement method, addressing the issue of time consumption while maintaining high-quality output.

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the AVR task to address the limitations of visual reasoning in real-world environments by enabling agents to gather, integrate, and adjust decisions dynamically in partially observable, interactive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs excel at static visual reasoning, their application in real-world environment tasks is hindered by the lack of interactivity and capability to handle partially observable scenarios, unlike humans who actively interact to gather information.

Method: Introduction of the AVR task and CLEVR-AVR simulation benchmark to evaluate interactive reasoning supported by their AVR-152k dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations. Developed a new model, PhysVLM-AVR, for embodied active reasoning.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR achieved state-of-the-art performance in both interactive and passive visual reasoning tasks, demonstrating the utility of the AVR framework and dataset.

Conclusion: Existing MLLMs have limitations in active reasoning and information integration, and the AVR framework provides a solution to overcome these shortcomings in practical, interactive environments.

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an object-centric and uncertainty-aware pipeline for object-level change detection in city-scale LiDAR data, yielding improved accuracy and IoU in comparison to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in maintaining high-definition 3D city maps necessary for applications such as HD map maintenance, smart transportation, and autonomous driving. Current methods face limitations such as sensitivity to vertical bias, viewpoint mismatch, unresolved object associations, and large memory demands.

Method: A pipeline is proposed comprising multi-resolution NDT for alignment, point-to-plane ICP for calibration, geometry-based proxies for cross-epoch associations, and tiled processing. Semantic and instance segmentation refine associations, with a bipartite assignment to handle splits and merges.

Result: On city-scale LiDAR datasets, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 95.2% accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU. It surpasses Triplet KPConv especially in IoU for changed structures, improving the metric by 7.6 points to reach 74.8%.

Conclusion: The pipeline is effective in addressing existing challenges in LiDAR change detection while providing improved, object-level accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Controllable-LPMoE, a fine-tuning method for foundation models that uses dynamic local priors and fewer parameters while achieving improved segmentation performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale foundation models have powerful feature representations but their full-parameter fine-tuning leads to high computational overhead, hindering training efficiency and their adaptability to specific tasks.

Method: The proposed method introduces a dynamic priors-based fine-tuning approach using a lightweight mixed local priors extractor and a bi-directional interaction adapter to enhance segmentation performance with fewer updated parameters.

Result: The method demonstrates superior segmentation performance compared to 31 state-of-the-art methods and shows adaptability across various binary object segmentation tasks based on extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Using dynamic local priors and an efficient fine-tuning paradigm, Controllable-LPMoE improves segmentation task performance while reducing computational cost and parameters, showcasing promise for future applications in specific tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying subtle safety implications in images and introduces SafetyPairs, a tool to generate precise counterfactual image pairs for fine-grained safety analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image safety datasets lack specificity, providing broad labels that fail to isolate the specific features which make images problematic or benign.

Method: SafetyPairs is a framework utilizing image editing models to create counterfactual image pairs by making targeted modifications while preserving non-safety-related aspects.

Result: Using SafetyPairs, the authors developed a benchmark containing over 3,020 images across 9 safety categories, which aids in evaluating model weaknesses and enhances training efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a systematic method for studying fine-grained image safety distinctions and provides valuable resources for evaluation and training of guard models.

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

### [98] [NoisyGRPO: Incentivizing Multimodal CoT Reasoning via Noise Injection and Bayesian Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21122)
*Longtian Qiu,Shan Ning,Jiaxuan Sun,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoisyGRPO, a multimodal RL framework that uses noise injection and Bayesian advantage estimation to improve Chain-of-Thought reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Results show better generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks struggle to improve general Chain-of-Thought reasoning in MLLMs due to limited generalization beyond training distribution.

Method: NoisyGRPO enhances RL training through noise-injected visual exploration to widen scenario coverage and Bayesian modeling for principled advantage estimation using trajectory reward and noise levels.

Result: Experimental evaluation confirms NoisyGRPO significantly improves generalization, robustness, and visual grounding, particularly for smaller MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO demonstrates the effectiveness of noise injection and Bayesian modeling for improving general Chain-of-Thought reasoning in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

### [99] [Digital Contrast CT Pulmonary Angiography Synthesis from Non-contrast CT for Pulmonary Vascular Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21140)
*Ying Ming,Yue Lin,Longfei Zhao,Gengwan Li,Zuopeng Tan,Bing Li,Sheng Xie,Wei Song,Qiqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT scans using CycleGAN, achieving superior image fidelity and vessel enhancement for pulmonary vascular diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of CTPA on iodinated contrast agents increases risks like nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions, which are problematic for high-risk patients. This study aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: A Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN)-based cascaded synthesizer was developed and trained on paired CTPA and NCCT scans. Retrospective datasets from three centers were used for training, validation, and testing.

Result: The model showed strong performance in terms of quantitative metrics (MAE, PSNR, SSIM), qualitative improvements in vessel enhancement and image preservation, and enhanced results in pulmonary vessel segmentation and vascular quantification tasks.

Conclusion: By generating DCCTPA from NCCT, the proposed model effectively improves vascular imaging performance, particularly for small vessels, showcasing strong promise for clinical applications without the need for iodinated contrast agents.

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

### [100] [Towards Physics-informed Spatial Intelligence with Human Priors: An Autonomous Driving Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21160)
*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG) to enhance spatial intelligence in foundation models, providing structured and detailed representations of object layouts and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to accurately integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models, as current methods relying on textual prompts and VQA-style scoring do not effectively represent geometrical and spatial skills.

Method: The authors propose SIG, a grid-based schema that encodes scene structures, object relations, and physical priors, along with SIG-informed metrics to independently evaluate spatial intelligence. Additionally, they introduced SIGBench as a benchmark dataset.

Result: SIG significantly improves spatial intelligence evaluation and few-shot learning performance in multimodal language models, outperforming traditional VQA representations across a variety of spatial metrics.

Conclusion: SIG enhances the representation and evaluation of spatial intelligence, showing importance for training and benchmarking future foundation models, especially in scenarios like autonomous driving.

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

### [101] [Blockwise Flow Matching: Improving Flow Matching Models For Efficient High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21167)
*Dogyun Park,Taehoon Lee,Minseok Joo,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), which partitions the generative process into smaller specialized blocks, improving efficiency and sample quality while reducing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional Flow Matching models are effective but face inefficiencies in capturing signal characteristics across timesteps and incur high inference costs.

Method: BFM divides the generative trajectory into temporal segments managed by smaller velocity blocks, introduces Semantic Feature Guidance for semantic conditioning, and uses Feature Residual Approximation to maintain quality and reduce costs.

Result: BFM achieves 2.1x to 4.9x faster inference complexity while maintaining comparable generation quality, demonstrated on ImageNet 256x256.

Conclusion: BFM enhances efficiency, accelerates inference, and improves sample quality, establishing it as a superior alternative to traditional Flow Matching models.

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

### [102] [TokenCLIP: Token-wise Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21171)
*Qihang Zhou,Binbin Gao,Guansong Pang,Xin Wang,Jiming Chen,Shibo He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP introduces a dynamic framework for token-wise anomaly detection, improving adaptability by aligning visual tokens with customized textual subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for anomaly detection using CLIP lack precision due to reliance on a single textual space for aligning visual semantics, which fails to capture diverse anomaly semantics across objects and domains.

Method: The approach dynamically aligns visual tokens to orthogonal subspaces representing customized textual characteristics using optimal transport based on semantic similarity. Sparsification via top-k masking is applied to enhance token-specific optimization.

Result: TokenCLIP achieves effective and efficient token-wise adaptation and demonstrates improved performance over existing methods across diverse anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic and token-specific alignment in TokenCLIP provides fine-grained anomaly learning with notable improvements in capturing diverse visual semantics.

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new protocol, named Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution (KBE), for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with dynamic benchmarks to address limitations in existing static benchmarking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static evaluation benchmarks for multimodal large language models have issues such as data contamination and saturation, leading to unreliable performance assessments.

Method: The paper applies graph formulation to represent Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples and integrates multimodal knowledge to transform static benchmarks into dynamic evolving ones called KBE. It allows evaluation with adjustable difficulty by reconstructing and expanding questions based on visual and textual data.

Result: KBE improves evaluation reliability by combating data contamination and saturation, and delivers a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic evolution framework KBE provides a novel, reliable, and controllable evaluation protocol for testing multimodal large language models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Result: PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast predictions for deformable object dynamics, generalizes to novel interactions, and performs inference at speeds 47 times faster than the state-of-the-art PhysTwin.

Conclusion: PhysWorld offers an efficient and scalable solution to learning world models for deformable object dynamics with improved accuracy and speed, leveraging synthetic data and simulator capabilities.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

*Anh Nguyen,Viet Nguyen,Duc Vu,Trung Dao,Chi Tran,Toan Tran,Anh Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes iSM, a training framework for shortcut generative models to resolve performance limitations, enabling improved image generation quality and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcut models for generative modeling face performance bottlenecks that limit their widespread adoption despite their promise of efficient sampling.

Method: The paper introduces the iSM framework, built on four main components: Intrinsic Guidance, Multi-Level Wavelet Loss, Scaling Optimal Transport (sOT), and the Twin EMA strategy, addressing challenges like image artifacts, frequency bias, and training instability.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in FID scores for shortcut models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, demonstrating higher quality and competitive generative performance.

Conclusion: The paper successfully enhances shortcut models with iSM, making them viable and competitive for generative modeling tasks, overcoming previous limitations efficiently.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: Nighttime UAV tracking faces challenges due to low-light conditions, cluttered environments, and viewpoint changes. A novel system, MATrack, enhances tracking through adaptive modules, outperforming existing methods by achieving better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical issues of nighttime UAV tracking including visual limitations, background clutter, and computational constraints in existing solutions.

Method: Proposed MATrack system consisting of three adaptive modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende, Adaptive Key Token Gate, and Nighttime Template Calibrator.

Result: MATrack significantly surpasses SOTA methods on the UAVDark135 benchmark in precision (+5.9%), normalized precision (+5.4%), and AUC (+4.2%), while operating at 81 FPS.

Conclusion: MATrack offers reliable and effective nighttime UAV tracking for critical applications such as search and rescue and border patrol operations.

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TSSR, a new method for generating high-quality 3D artist-style meshes using Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for TSSR is to achieve accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, overcoming limitations of traditional sequential autoregressive methods.

Method: The methodology involves dividing the generation process into topology sculpting and shape refinement stages, employing an improved hourglass architecture with rotational positional embeddings, and using a novel connection loss to enhance realism and fidelity.

Result: TSSR successfully generates 3D meshes with up to 10,000 faces at high spatial resolution (1024^3), delivering artist-level quality.

Conclusion: TSSR provides an innovative solution for efficient and high-quality mesh generation, paving the way for improved artistry in 3D modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS offers photorealistic real-time rendering but lacks semantics and physical execution for practical VLN applications. The paper addresses this gap to enhance navigability and utility in 3D environments.

Method: SAGE-3D incorporates two components: Object-Centric Semantic Grounding for object-level annotation and Physics-Aware Execution Jointing for embedding collision and interactive physical objects into 3DGS.

Result: The proposed benchmark, SAGE-Bench, demonstrated a 31% performance improvement on the VLN-CE Unseen task. The system also exhibits better generalizability despite the inherent difficulty of 3DGS scene data.

Conclusion: SAGE-3D upgrades 3DGS into an executable, semantically and physically enriched framework, making it viable for VLN tasks. Datasets and benchmarks released will further advance research in this domain.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage framework for improving Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on identifying small objects in high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with understanding and localizing fine details, especially for very small objects in complex high-resolution images due to restricted input resolutions.

Method: The proposed framework, \textsc{FineRS}, employs a coarse-to-fine approach: Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) for reasoning and locating a coarse region, and Localized Perceptual Refinement (LPR) for accurate bounding boxes and segmentation. A reward mechanism couples both stages.

Result: Experiments on the newly presented \textsc{FineRS}-4k dataset and public benchmarks show that \textsc{FineRS} outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in segmentation and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: \textsc{FineRS} offers a novel solution for enhancing MLLM capabilities in fine-grained visual tasks, validated by superior performance on new and existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

### [112] [VL-SAE: Interpreting and Enhancing Vision-Language Alignment with a Unified Concept Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21323)
*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-SAE aims to interpret and enhance vision-language model alignments by mapping multimodal representations into a unified concept set using a sparse autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models exhibit strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, but their alignment component's interpretability is uninvestigated due to difficulties in mapping semantics across modalities into a unified concept.

Method: VL-SAE introduces a sparse autoencoder with neurons correlated to unified concepts, encouraging semantically similar vision-language representations to activate consistently through cosine similarity, and utilizes a distance-based encoder with modality-specific decoders.

Result: VL-SAE enhances interpretation and alignment in existing vision-language models, strengthening downstream task performance (e.g., zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination).

Conclusion: VL-SAE bridges the interpretability gap in vision-language alignments and demonstrates improved model performance by aligning representations at the unified concept level through its approach.

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

*Reed Naidoo,Matt De Vries,Olga Fourkioti,Vicky Bousgouni,Mar Arias-Garcia,Maria Portillo-Malumbres,Chris Bakal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FORM, a machine learning framework for modeling 3D cellular morphology changes under perturbations, enabling predictive simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models for cellular responses are limited to 2D representations, preventing comprehensive analysis of 3D cellular morphology under perturbation.

Method: FORM uses a multi-channel VQGAN to encode 3D cell shapes and a diffusion-based module for perturbation-induced trajectory prediction, trained on a dataset of 65,000 3D cell volumes.

Result: FORM enables both unconditional morphology synthesis and conditional perturbation simulations, along with downstream signaling predictions, combinatorial effects modeling, and unseen perturbation transitions.

Conclusion: FORM and MorphoEval advance the creation of accurate 3D virtual cell models, bridging morphology, perturbation, and biological function through high-resolution predictive simulations.

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

*Lemin Liu,Fangchao Hu,Honghua Jiang,Yaru Chen,Limin Liu,Yongliang Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CT-CLIP, a novel framework combining CNN, Vision Transformer, and multimodal learning for effective recognition of apple leaf diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple leaf diseases are difficult to accurately recognize due to phenotypic heterogeneity and challenges in fusing local and global features.

Method: The study introduced a multi-branch framework (CT-CLIP) combining CNN, Vision Transformer, and an Adaptive Feature Fusion Module. It also used CLIP-based multimodal learning for aligning visual and textual representations.

Result: CT-CLIP achieved high accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12% on tested datasets, outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: CT-CLIP effectively enhances disease recognition under complex orchard conditions, providing an innovative solution for automating agricultural disease identification.

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

*Xinyu Zhou,Tongxin Pan,Lingyi Hong,Pinxue Guo,Haijing Guo,Zhaoyu Chen,Kaixun Jiang,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic semantic-aware framework to improve UAV tracking accuracy and robustness, addressing issues like camera motion, fast motion, and low resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for UAV tracking lack semantic awareness, hindering accurate localization in challenging scenarios.

Method: A framework using a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator and correlation modeling with a Transformer, paired with a pruning method for speed optimization.

Result: The method achieves competitive results on UAV tracking datasets, balancing accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances UAV tracking performance and provides flexible deployment options based on computational resources.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

*Anupam Pani,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gaze-regularized framework to enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for egocentric understanding tasks, improving event prediction and activity comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric understanding tasks like future event prediction and activity comprehension need improved modeling. Eye gaze is a promising signal for enhancing predictive accuracy but has not been fully harnessed in VLMs.

Method: A gaze-regularized attention mechanism is introduced, which aligns model focus with human gaze during training. The framework is modular and flexible, applicable to various VLM architectures.

Result: The proposed method boosts semantic prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and about 7 for activity understanding compared to baselines without gaze regularization.

Conclusion: Using human gaze signals during training significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of VLMs, paving the way for improved real-world applications like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

### [117] [Why Registration Quality Matters: Enhancing sCT Synthesis with IMPACT-Based Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21358)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified pipeline for synthetic CT generation using a 2.5D U-Net++ model, achieving anatomically consistent alignments and improved sCT synthesis results, but highlights challenges with registration bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of synthetic CT generation from MRI and CBCT imaging and improve anatomical fidelity and sCT synthesis robustness.

Method: A 2.5D U-Net++ model with ResNet-34 encoder was trained across anatomical regions and implemented in the KonfAI framework, combining L1 loss and perceptual loss derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator.

Result: The IMPACT-based registration yielded better anatomical alignment and lower MAE on local test data, while registration bias influenced higher scores for Elastix-aligned data on the validation set.

Conclusion: IMPACT promotes anatomically consistent alignment, reducing registration errors, and contributes to the development of robust and generalizable sCT synthesis models while highlighting biases in evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

*Xi Zhang,Hanwei Zhu,Yan Zhong,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for diffusion models to dynamically adapt their image generation quality based on network bandwidth constraints, enhancing efficiency in bandwidth-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models fail to account for real-time bandwidth constraints during image generation, leading to unnecessary computation and loss of image quality during compression in cloud-to-device transmissions.

Method: The proposed method introduces an end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from available bandwidth. A lightweight quality embedding is incorporated to guide denoising, allowing for adaptive and early-stop sampling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in visual fidelity for images generated under bandwidth constraints, outperforming naive early-stopping methods.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the inefficiencies of traditional diffusion models in bandwidth-limited scenarios, providing a practical solution for maintaining visual quality during complex communications. The approach strategically incorporates minimal architectural changes while adapting image quality dynamically.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TerraGen, a unified layout-to-image generation framework for remote sensing imagery, enabling spatially controllable synthesis for multiple tasks. It introduces geographic-spatial modeling and specific techniques for improved image generation quality and downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative data augmentation frameworks for remote sensing tasks are isolated for individual tasks and lack integration of geographical information and spatial constraints.

Method: TerraGen uses a geographic-spatial layout encoder to unify bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to encode spatial constraints. A large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset with evaluation protocols is built.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TerraGen achieves high image generation quality for diverse tasks, improving performance for downstream detection, segmentation, and extraction tasks, including robust generalization in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: TerraGen serves as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing task performance and enabling spatially controllable image synthesis for various high-level vision tasks in remote sensing.

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to address the challenges of ghosting and misalignment in image stitching caused by large parallax. It uses depth consistency and seamless-free constraints, combining a multi-stage alignment approach and graph-based fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues in image stitching, particularly ghosting and misalignment caused by variations in depth and large parallax.

Method: The approach involves multi-stage alignment using depth regularization constraints and graph-based seam localization for a seamless result. Computation efficiency is improved using reparameterization.

Result: The proposed method delivers superior performance compared to existing techniques, achieving seamless and natural stitching results.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses parallax-induced stitching artifacts and improves algorithm efficiency, providing seamless results. Extensive experiments validate its performance.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval (MUVR) task and a benchmark to advance video retrieval for long platforms, emphasizing nuanced retrieval approaches and extensive evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of retrieving relevant segments from untrimmed long videos using multi-modal queries, addressing gaps in current video retrieval systems and their inability to handle complex matching criteria.

Method: The study develops the MUVR benchmark with features like video-centric multi-modal queries, multi-level visual correspondence, and comprehensive evaluation approaches including a Reranking Score. It involves 53K videos from Bilibili, over 1K queries, and evaluates multiple retrieval models.

Result: Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art methods reveal their limitations in handling untrimmed video and multi-modal queries. MUVR highlights gaps in both retrieval models and MLLMs, providing insights for future improvements.

Conclusion: MUVR introduces a novel retrieval framework for long untrimmed videos, fostering advancements in video retrieval tasks by revealing current model weaknesses and setting benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study presents a scalable framework for identifying and grounding diverse visual concepts in real-world scenes using pretrained vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual concept learning are restricted to predefined axes (e.g., color and shape) and rely on synthetic datasets, lacking scalability in real-world applications.

Method: The framework leverages pretrained vision-language models with universal prompting to discover concept axes dynamically. Visual features are adaptively encoded without adding extra model parameters. A compositional anchoring objective is used to ensure independent manipulation of identified axes.

Result: The proposed framework showed superior editing capabilities and outperformed previous methods on subsets of ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ.

Conclusion: This innovative approach improves scalability and compositional generalization in real-world visual concept learning, making significant strides beyond synthetic datasets and predefined concepts.

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

TL;DR: ArtiLatent is a generative framework designed to synthesize human-made 3D objects with detailed geometry, articulation dynamics, and realistic appearance using advanced embedding, variational autoencoder, and latent diffusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in synthesizing 3D objects with accurate geometry, articulation, and visually realistic features, particularly those having dynamic components like furniture with movable parts.

Method: The authors developed a framework combining sparse voxel embedding, articulation property modeling (joint details), and a variational autoencoder. They trained a latent diffusion model over this space and introduced an articulation-aware Gaussian decoder to account for dynamic visibility to ensure realistic reconstruction.

Result: ArtiLatent outperforms previous methods in maintaining geometric consistency, articulation accuracy, and appearance fidelity in 3D object generation. Tests conducted on furniture datasets (PartNet-Mobility and ACD) confirmed these findings.

Conclusion: ArtiLatent provides a scalable and effective solution for synthesizing and manipulating physically plausible articulated 3D objects, enabling enhanced realism and practicality for various applications.

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [124] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores improving LUT-based image restoration CNNs by developing anisotropic pooling approaches rather than the commonly used average pooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LUT-realizable CNN methods achieve fast and resource-efficient image restoration, but average pooling used for fusion often performs poorly on anisotropic signal structures.

Method: The authors propose generalized median pooling and learning data-dependent pooling coefficients to adaptively weigh contributions from differently oriented pixel patches.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic pooling methods outperform previous LUT-realizable CNN approaches in both perceptual and numerical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Anisotropic pooling strategies effectively enhance the potential of LUT-based CNN restoration, addressing limitations in average-pooling fusion methods.

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Result: OpenHype surpasses state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, showcasing better efficiency and adaptability in understanding 3D scenes.

Conclusion: OpenHype is a promising solution to improve hierarchical representation of 3D scenes, combining efficiency and generalization through hyperbolic space.

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

*Shengtian Yang,Yue Feng,Yingshi Liu,Jingrou Zhang,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MoniTor, a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for training-free Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), aiming to address challenges in online VAD by utilizing large language and vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance online Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which has been underexplored due to real-time computational constraints, and leverage advancements in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to improve anomaly detection.

Method: The proposed method, MoniTor, uses streaming input to pre-trained VLMs along with a novel LSTM-inspired prediction mechanism to capture temporal dependencies. A dynamic scoring queue and anomaly prior are designed to maintain recent anomaly scores, helping distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors in real-time.

Result: Experiments were conducted on two large datasets: UCF-Crime and XD-Violence. The results demonstrated that MoniTor outperformed state-of-the-art methods and showed strong competitiveness with weakly supervised methods without requiring training.

Conclusion: MoniTor effectively improves the performance of online video anomaly detection through an innovative memory-based scoring method that eliminates the need for additional training, making it both efficient and high-performing.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

### [127] [VidSplice: Towards Coherent Video Inpainting via Explicit Spaced Frame Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21461)
*Ming Xie,Junqiu Yu,Qiaole Dong,Xiangyang Xue,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice enhances video inpainting by introducing spaced-frame spatiotemporal priors, improving consistency and motion stability, particularly under severe degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video inpainting methods struggle with severe content degradation and lack spatiotemporal stability, limiting control over video consistency.

Method: VidSplice decouples video inpainting into consistent image inpainting and masked motion propagation. It introduces spaced-frame priors, a CoSpliced Module for spatial coherence, and a context controller module to constrain distortions during generation.

Result: VidSplice achieves competitive inpainting performance in diverse scenarios, significantly improving foreground alignment and motion consistency over existing methods.

Conclusion: VidSplice provides a robust framework that overcomes key limitations in video inpainting, enhancing alignment and stability, and setting a higher standard in the field.

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

*Yiming Tang,Wenjia Zhong,Rushi Shah,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CXR-LanIC, a framework to improve interpretability of AI models in chest X-ray diagnosis by aligning visual patterns with diagnostic objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of the black-box nature of deep learning models in chest X-ray diagnosis, which limits clinical adoption due to lack of transparent and trustable explanations.

Method: The authors propose CXR-LanIC, which uses transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on BiomedCLIP diagnostic classifiers to discover interpretable visual patterns linked to diagnostic objectives.

Result: CXR-LanIC identifies around 5,000 interpretable patterns across different medical categories, achieving competitive diagnostic accuracy for key findings and offering transparent, verifiable visual explanations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that medical AI systems can achieve high diagnostic accuracy while ensuring interpretability, paving the way for safer and more transparent clinical deployment through grounded explanations.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

*Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Lintao Xiang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops a dual-stream architecture combining tissue-level and cell-level analysis for histopathological image interpretation. It introduces a model for efficient cell aggregation and a module for tissue-cell interaction, significantly improving cancer subtype classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathological image analysis requires reconciling fine-grained cellular characteristics with broad tissue organization for precise tasks such as cancer subtype classification, yet current approaches largely omit cell-level feature modeling.

Method: A dual-stream architecture integrating macroscale tissue attributes and cellular representations is complemented by a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model for inter-cell relations and a tissue-cell interaction module for localized attention between cells and tissue.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in cancer subtype classification across four benchmark datasets, highlighting the importance of combining cellular and tissue-level interaction features.

Conclusion: Cell-level feature aggregation and interaction with tissue context are critical for advancing fine-grained histopathological image analysis, as demonstrated by the improved classification performance of the proposed model.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAP-MOT is a novel solution for multi-camera MOT in congested spaces, integrating feature tracking, community search, and position data for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of person tracking in overlapping multi-camera views and highly congested spaces.

Method: Developed GRAP-MOT, incorporating feature extraction, tracking, position estimation, and community search in the MOT process.

Result: GRAP-MOT outperformed existing methods in closed-area models and public datasets, with better handling of occlusions and congested spaces.

Conclusion: GRAP-MOT improves multi-camera MOT accuracy in challenging environments and proposes IDF1 as a better metric for evaluation. The code and dataset are made publicly accessible.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

### [131] [GranViT: A Fine-Grained Vision Model With Autoregressive Perception For MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21501)
*Guanghao Zheng,Bowen Shi,Mingxing Xu,Ruoyu Sun,Peisen Zhao,Zhibo Zhang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong,Xiaopeng Zhang,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GranViT, a Vision Transformer designed for fine-grained feature extraction and semantic alignment to Large Language Models through region-level training, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders lack fine-grained regional analysis and perception due to insufficient annotated data and pre-training paradigms.

Method: GranViT integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to LLMs using region-level autoregressive training based on a new dataset, Gran-29M, and incorporates self-distillation for enhanced regional reasoning.

Result: GranViT outperformed current vision encoders, demonstrating strong adaptability to various LLMs and achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained recognition, multimodal visual question answering, and OCR tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully addresses the limitations of existing vision encoders by refining localized visual representation and enhancing regional reasoning capabilities through fine-grained pretraining and adaptability frameworks.

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

*Kaibo Wang,Jianda Mao,Tong Wu,Yang Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Foresight Guidance (FSG), which improves conditional guidance in text-to-image diffusion models, showcasing better performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the understanding and efficiency of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in text-to-image diffusion models by addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Method: The authors introduce a unified perspective of fixed point iterations and propose the FSG, which focuses on solving longer-interval subproblems during early diffusion stages with increased iterations.

Result: FSG is validated through extensive experiments across various datasets and architectures, showcasing its superiority in image quality and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The work provides novel insights into conditional guidance and demonstrates the potential for adaptive design strategies in advancing diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

### [133] [Head Pursuit: Probing Attention Specialization in Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21518)
*Lorenzo Basile,Valentino Maiorca,Diego Doimo,Francesco Locatello,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines how attention heads in generative models specialize and influence specific semantic or visual attributes, proposing a method to analyze and control their behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of understanding of the internal mechanisms of language and vision-language models, which limits interpretability and controllability in large-scale generative systems.

Method: The authors used an interpretability method reinterpreted through signal processing principles to analyze multiple samples, rank attention heads by relevance to concepts, and selectively edit these heads to evaluate their impact.

Result: By editing around 1% of attention heads, the authors demonstrated the ability to suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output with consistency across unimodal and multimodal models.

Conclusion: The study reveals an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers of generative models, providing a foundation for further advancements in understanding and editing these systems.

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control introduces a lightweight method for video-guided Foley by employing pretrained models connected through a compact cross-attention bridge, achieving efficient synchronization without end-to-end retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a video-guided Foley system that maintains prompt controllability, modularity, and competitive alignment without requiring large-scale multi-modal model training.

Method: The approach connects pretrained video embeddings and a text-to-audio model using a compact cross-attention mechanism, allowing video inputs to refine timing and dynamics while text sets semantic context.

Result: Foley Control achieves competitive temporal and semantic alignment on benchmarks using fewer trainable parameters, while allowing encoder or backbone flexibility.

Conclusion: Foley Control delivers practical advantages in modularity and efficient training, with potential application beyond Foley to other audio modalities like speech.

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

TL;DR: Chunk-GRPO improves text-to-image generation by addressing limitations in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a chunk-based optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve text-to-image generation by addressing the challenges of inaccurate advantage attribution and neglect of temporal dynamics in GRPO methods.

Method: Chunk-GRPO groups consecutive steps into chunks that capture temporal dynamics and optimizes policies at the chunk level. It also incorporates an optional weighted sampling strategy to improve performance.

Result: Chunk-GRPO demonstrates superior performance in preference alignment and image quality through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Chunk-level optimization is a promising direction for advancing GRPO-based text-to-image generation approaches.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TIGER, a two-stage super-resolution framework designed to maintain both text readability and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative super-resolution methods are effective on natural images but compromise text readability, creating a trade-off between quality and clarity.

Method: TIGER adopts a 'text-first, image-later' strategy, decoupling text glyph restoration and image enhancement into separate stages. Additionally, it introduces UltraZoom-ST—a dataset with extreme zoom—and uses glyph guidance for improved fidelity.

Result: TIGER demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, enhancing text readability while preserving image quality across a new dataset and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The approach resolves the tension between textual readability and image refinement in generative super-resolution through targeted methods and new datasets.

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

*Pauline Mouches,Julien Jung,Armand Demasson,Agnès Guinard,Romain Bouet,Rosalie Marchal,Romain Quentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents automated deep learning methods to detect interictal spikes in magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings to support presurgical evaluations in drug-resistant epilepsy cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual detection methods for interictal spikes in MEG are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack interrater reliability. Existing automated models aren't robust or practical for clinical use, highlighting the need for improved tools.

Method: The authors propose two deep learning models (a feature-based ANN and a CNN) trained using temporal annotations from 59 patients. They enhance annotation quality through interactive machine learning leveraging intermediary model outputs.

Result: Both models outperform a state-of-the-art baseline in terms of F1-score (CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44). They show robustness even under noisy data annotations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that simple architectures can handle imperfectly annotated data effectively, enabling faster annotations and reliable automated spike detection, making them promising for clinical epilepsy evaluations.

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces S3OD, a large synthetic dataset for better generalization in salient object detection, achieving significant error reduction through ambiguity-aware architecture and model training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salient object detection requires precise annotations, which are expensive and hinder cross-task model generalization.

Method: Using a multi-modal diffusion pipeline, the authors created the S3OD dataset with iterative generation and ambiguity-aware architecture to enable multiple valid predictions.

Result: Synthetic data-trained models achieve 20-50% error reduction in generalization, and fine-tuning leads to state-of-the-art performance on DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation combined with streamlined architectural improvements enhances performance and promotes generalization in salient object detection tasks.

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

### [139] [Modest-Align: Data-Efficient Alignment for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21606)
*Jiaxiang Liu,Yuan Wang,Jiawei Du,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Mingkun Xu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modest-Align is a lightweight framework for cross-modal alignment that addresses performance issues in low-resource scenarios by reducing overconfidence and improving robustness through controlled noise and smoothing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges faced by cross-modal alignment models, like CLIP, in resource-constrained settings due to overconfidence and poor performance stemming from weakly correlated or ambiguous data.

Method: The proposed Modest-Align framework utilizes two strategies: Random Perturbation for simulated uncertainty and Embedding Smoothing for similarity distribution calibration in the embedding space.

Result: Extensive experiments show Modest-Align outperforms existing methods in retrieval tasks, using significantly less training data and computational resources while maintaining strong performance.

Conclusion: Modest-Align provides a practical and efficient solution for cross-modal alignment in low-resource settings, enhancing robustness and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly

demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval

### [140] [Epipolar Geometry Improves Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21615)
*Orest Kupyn,Fabian Manhardt,Federico Tombari,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve video diffusion models through classical epipolar geometry constraints, enhancing spatial consistency and addressing artifacts in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models face challenges like geometric inconsistencies and unstable motion, limiting their ability to produce realistic 3D-scene videos.

Method: The approach aligns video diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry constraints and preference-based optimization, tackling unstable camera trajectories and artifacts without depending on end-to-end differentiability.

Result: The proposed method shows that classical geometric constraints outperform modern learned metrics, leading to better spatial alignment in generated videos.

Conclusion: The study bridges deep learning and classical geometric computer vision, providing a feasible solution for spatially consistent video generation without sacrificing visual quality.

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

*Ziqi Gao,Qiufu Li,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DAP-MAE, a novel pre-training method to address data scarcity in 3D point cloud analysis by adaptively integrating cross-domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud data scarcity hinders effective training for 3D point cloud analysis. Current methods of combining datasets across domains for pre-training lead to suboptimal learning due to misaligned prior knowledge.

Method: The authors propose DAP-MAE, featuring a heterogeneous domain adapter for cross-domain pre-training and fine-tuning. Additionally, a domain feature generator ensures the point cloud features are well-suited for downstream tasks.

Result: DAP-MAE demonstrates significant performance improvements in multiple point cloud analysis tasks, achieving 95.18% object classification accuracy on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% facial expression recognition accuracy on Bosphorus dataset.

Conclusion: DAP-MAE effectively addresses the limitations of prior methods by enabling adaptive learning from cross-domain point cloud data, improving the generalization and performance of downstream analysis tasks.

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

### [142] [A Dynamic Knowledge Distillation Method Based on the Gompertz Curve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21649)
*Han Yang,Guangjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gompertz-CNN, a dynamic knowledge distillation framework that uses the Gompertz growth model to improve student model training. It achieves accuracy improvements in experiments with CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods fail to account for the evolving learning capabilities of student models, leading to inefficient knowledge transfer.

Method: The proposed Gompertz-CNN dynamically adjusts the weight of distillation losses based on the Gompertz curve, incorporating a stage-aware distillation strategy, Wasserstein distance, and gradient matching under a multi-loss objective.

Result: The framework demonstrates up to 8% improvement in accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 4% on CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures.

Conclusion: By integrating the Gompertz growth model and advanced strategies into distillation, Gompertz-CNN enhances the efficiency of knowledge transfer, outperforming conventional methods in accuracy gains.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

*Ying Xue,Jiaxi Jiang,Rayan Armani,Dominik Hollidt,Yi-Chi Liao,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group Inertial Poser (GIP), a system for accurate multi-person 3D motion tracking using sparse wearable IMUs and UWB, enhancing state-of-the-art performance and releasing a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of vision-based motion tracking and improve the accuracy and robustness of IMU-based multi-person motion tracking, especially for relative positioning and translation estimates.

Method: The proposed method, Group Inertial Poser (GIP), uses sparse wearable inertial sensors and ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) to estimate absolute distances between sensors and fuses these with inertial data. A two-step optimization integrates temporal motion for accurate 3D pose and global trajectory estimation.

Result: Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous methods in accuracy and robustness in synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, the authors introduce GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed IMU+UWB-based tracking method demonstrates significant advancements in multi-human motion capture, making it viable for real-world applications. The release of GIP-DB further supports future research in this domain.

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

### [144] [Long-tailed Species Recognition in the NACTI Wildlife Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21657)
*Zehua Liu,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates methods to address long-tailed class imbalance for wildlife species recognition, achieving improved accuracy over baselines and existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to handle severe class imbalance in the NACTI dataset, a common issue in natural world datasets, for better performance in wildlife species recognition.

Method: The authors perform a systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition (LTR) methodologies, including various LTR loss functions, regularization techniques, and optimization schedules.

Result: Their best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1 accuracy on the NACTI dataset, surpassing baselines and existing benchmarks. A domain-shift test shows improved generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper highlights consistent improvements from LTR methods while documenting unresolved challenges, particularly for tail classes under domain shifts, and releases resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

*Aarav Shetty,Gary B Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unsupervised method to classify synapses in EM images based on their similarity within the same neuron, applied to Drosophila data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying synapses based on their structure has biological relevance, such as identifying neurotransmitter types or synaptic strength modulation, traditionally done using supervised methods.

Method: The authors developed an unsupervised classification model that leverages the similarity of synapses within the same neuron, without prior knowledge of the number of synapse types.

Result: The proposed method successfully applies to Drosophila data, demonstrating its capability to classify synapses and identify structural diversity without supervision.

Conclusion: This unsupervised approach offers a flexible and principled way to study synapse types, potentially aiding in selecting more representative ground-truths across synapse structures.

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates foundation models UNI and Virchow2 for classifying dermatopathology whole-slide images into melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous categories, with Virchow2 showing better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for automated processing and accurate classification of dermatopathology whole-slide images due to their rapid generation.

Method: Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using mean-aggregation. Multiple classifiers like logistic regression were trained, utilizing precision, recall, AUROC metrics; results tracked via WandB.ai.

Result: Virchow2 outperformed UNI in patch-level feature extraction with the highest accuracy (90%) achieved by logistic regression; no significant statistical differences noted.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for scalable automated WSI classification in dermatopathology, enabling robust diagnosis and advancing slide-level representation methods.

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

*Sikuang Li,Chen Yang,Jiemin Fang,Taoran Yi,Jia Lu,Jiazhong Cen,Lingxi Xie,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldGrow, a hierarchical approach for infinite 3D scene synthesis, overcoming challenges in existing methods with structured scene block generation and state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in creating infinitely extendable 3D worlds with coherent geometry and realistic appearance, as existing methods lack scalability, consistency, or are overly object-centric.

Method: WorldGrow utilizes a hierarchical framework comprising data curation for high-quality scene blocks, 3D block inpainting for context-aware extension, and a coarse-to-fine strategy ensuring layout plausibility and fidelity.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction on the 3D-FRONT dataset and supports infinite scene synthesis with photorealistic and structurally consistent outputs.

Conclusion: WorldGrow demonstrates its ability to generate large-scale virtual environments and indicates potential for future world modeling applications.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

TL;DR: This study enhances ecological monitoring by integrating post-hoc explanations into neural-network models to build trust through auditable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust in neural-network-based models for ecological research, addressing the lack of transparency of these 'black-box' models to accelerate conservation monitoring.

Method: The authors leverage Faster R-CNN for detecting harbor seals in aerial images and implement post-hoc explanation methods such as HiResCAM, LayerCAM, LIME, and perturbation-based techniques to interpret model predictions along axes like fidelity, faithfulness, and diagnostic utility.

Result: The model explanations localized seals effectively and highlighted their contours while indicating systematic errors such as confusing seals with black ice or rocks.

Conclusion: Combining object detection with explainability fosters transparency and guidance for field deployment, offering actionable insights like data curation and informed conservation strategies.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BachVid introduces a training-free method for generating consistent videos without using reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds in text-to-video generation without relying on extensive training or reference images.

Method: Analyze Diffusion Transformers' attention mechanisms and intermediate features to leverage cached identity video variables for ensuring consistency in foreground and background across videos.

Result: Experiments show that BachVid achieves robust consistency in video generation without requiring further training or reference images.

Conclusion: BachVid offers a novel, efficient solution for consistent multi-video generation, expanding capabilities in T2V models.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

*Nir Goren,Shai Yehezkel,Omer Dahary,Andrey Voynov,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the application of visual diffusion models to solve complex geometric problems by transforming noisy images into valid solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore visual diffusion models as tools for addressing geometric challenges that traditionally require specialized architectures and domain-specific approaches.

Method: The authors use standard visual diffusion models to transform Gaussian noise images into approximate solutions of geometric problems, recasting geometric reasoning into image generation tasks.

Result: The diffusion models successfully solved the Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem, showcasing their ability to generate valid geometric configurations from noisy data.

Conclusion: The findings establish the effectiveness of visual diffusion models in solving hard geometric problems and propose a general framework for tackling complex geometric challenges using image space operations.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using a self-reflective agent to detect unintended visual attribute reliance in vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure robustness and prevent overfitting by detecting unnecessary dependencies in vision models' predictions.

Method: An iterative, self-reflective agent generates, tests, and refines hypotheses about visual attribute dependencies using a self-evaluation protocol.

Result: Evaluation on 130 models showed improved performance through self-reflection, outperforming non-reflective methods, and identifying real-world attribute dependencies in models like CLIP and YOLOv8.

Conclusion: Self-reflection enhances detection of visual dependencies, improving model reliability and applicability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

*Dandan Liang,Jianing Zhang,Evan Chen,Zhe Li,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Split Federated Learning (SFL) faces scalability issues due to straggler delays. MU-SplitFed effectively tackles this problem using a straggler-resilient mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the straggler issue in Split Federated Learning, which limits scalability and efficiency due to synchronization requirements between Split Server and clients.

Method: MU-SplitFed introduces a zeroth-order optimization technique with an unbalanced update mechanism, enabling the server to complete multiple local updates per client round to decouple training from straggler delays.

Result: MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of O(√d/(τT)) and linear speedup in communication rounds. Experimental results confirm superior performance while mitigating straggler impact.

Conclusion: MU-SplitFed offers an effective solution for managing stragglers and improving system scalability in SFL while maintaining optimal convergence.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) enables scalable training on edge devices by
combining the parallelism of Federated Learning (FL) with the computational
offloading of Split Learning (SL). Despite its great success, SFL suffers
significantly from the well-known straggler issue in distributed learning
systems. This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and
clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations
from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time
latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and
efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a
straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples
training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced
update mechanism.
  By enabling the server to perform $\tau$ local updates per client round,
MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\sqrt{d/(\tau T)})$ for
non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\tau$ in
communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently
outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively
mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\tau$. The code for this
project is available at https://github.com/Johnny-Zip/MU-SplitFed.

Method: The paper introduces an intelligent system to translate SLAs into vendor-neutral metrics and outlines these metrics for measurement across providers. Validation was conducted via use cases within IaaS and PaaS environments.

Result: Validation showed that the proposed system enables transparent multi-cloud utilization, supported by feedback from cloud experts.

Conclusion: The solution empowers cloud consumers to leverage multi-cloud environments seamlessly, overcoming provider lock-in and ensuring SLA compliance across diverse platforms.

Abstract: Cloud computing has been consolidated as a support for the vast majority of
current and emerging technologies. However, there are some barriers that
prevent the exploitation of the full potential of this technology. First, the
major cloud providers currently put the onus of implementing the mechanisms
that ensure compliance with the desired service levels on cloud consumers.
However, consumers do not have the required expertise. Since each cloud
provider exports a different set of low-level metrics, the strategies defined
to ensure compliance with the established service-level agreement (SLA) are
bound to a particular cloud provider. This fosters provider lock-in and
prevents consumers from benefiting from the advantages of multi-cloud
environments. This paper presents a solution to the problem of automatically
translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured
across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent
knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs
defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral
metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system).
Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can
be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation
based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by
leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the
complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and
transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed
by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.

### [155] [Generative Federated Learning for Smart Prediction and Recommendation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21183)
*Anwesha Mukherjee,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Generative Federated Learning (GFL) framework to enhance smart prediction and recommendation applications in challenges such as slow response, data privacy, and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to tackle high response time, compromised data privacy, and data scarcity challenges in smart prediction and recommendation systems motivated this research.

Method: The proposed GFL integrates generative adversarial networks with federated learning and explores both centralized and decentralized federated learning architectures in an edge computing paradigm.

Result: The GFL framework improves prediction accuracy by 12% and reduces response time by 73% compared to conventional solutions.

Conclusion: Generative Federated Learning demonstrates superior performance for heart health monitoring systems, addressing critical issues like data scarcity, privacy, and system efficiency.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generative adversarial network and federated
learning-based model to address various challenges of the smart prediction and
recommendation applications, such as high response time, compromised data
privacy, and data scarcity. The integration of the generative adversarial
network and federated learning is referred to as Generative Federated Learning
(GFL). As a case study of the proposed model, a heart health monitoring
application is considered. The realistic synthetic datasets are generated using
the generated adversarial network-based proposed algorithm for improving data
diversity, data quality, and data augmentation, and remove the data scarcity
and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we implement the centralized and
decentralized federated learning approaches in an edge computing paradigm. In
centralized federated learning, the edge nodes communicate with the central
server to build the global and personalized local models in a collaborative
manner. In the decentralized federated learning approach, the edge nodes
communicate among themselves to exchange model updates for collaborative
training. The comparative study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
the existing heart health monitoring applications. The results show that using
the proposed framework (i) the prediction accuracy is improved by 12% than the
conventional framework, and (ii) the response time is reduced by 73% than the
conventional cloud-only system.

### [156] [Arbitration-Free Consistency is Available (and Vice Versa)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21304)
*Hagit Attiya,Constantin Enea,Enrique Román-Calvo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the tension between availability and consistency in distributed systems and introduces the Arbitration-Free Consistency (AFC) theorem, identifying conditions for availability-driven implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a precise explanation of the trade-offs between object semantics and consistency models in distributed storage systems.

Method: Uses a semantic framework combining operation semantics and consistency models to analyze the conditions for available implementations across various objects and models.

Result: Proposes the AFC theorem, proving availability of implementations if specifications avoid the need for total arbitration order to resolve dependencies.

Conclusion: Arbitration-freedom is the key property for distinguishing coordination-free consistency models in distributed systems.

Abstract: The fundamental tension between \emph{availability} and \emph{consistency}
shapes the design of distributed storage systems. Classical results capture
extreme points of this trade-off: the CAP theorem shows that strong models like
linearizability preclude availability under partitions, while weak models like
causal consistency remain implementable without coordination. These theorems
apply to simple read-write interfaces, leaving open a precise explanation of
the combinations of object semantics and consistency models that admit
available implementations.
  This paper develops a general semantic framework in which storage
specifications combine operation semantics and consistency models. The
framework encompasses a broad range of objects (key-value stores, counters,
sets, CRDTs, and transactional databases) and consistency models (from causal
consistency and sequential consistency to snapshot isolation and transactional
and non-transactional SQL).
  Within this framework, we prove the \emph{Arbitration-Free Consistency} (AFC)
theorem, showing that an object specification within a consistency model admits
an available implementation if and only if it is \emph{arbitration-free}, that
is, it does not require a total arbitration order to resolve visibility or read
dependencies.
  The AFC theorem unifies and generalizes previous results, revealing
arbitration-freedom as the fundamental property that delineates
coordination-free consistency from inherently synchronized behavior.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Parsley introduces proactive techniques to enhance Distributed Hash Table stability under churn with justified parameter values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stability and robustness in Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), especially under churn, using novel mechanisms for group size management.

Method: Parsley applies preemptive peer relocation and dynamic data sharding with systematic overlay characterization to justify its parameters.

Result: The study highlights the effectiveness of Parsley's group size mechanism and provides a comprehensive understanding of its configuration impact on performance and scalability.

Conclusion: Parsley’s parameter-driven design, backed by systematic analysis, ensures enhanced robustness and stability in DHTs under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Parsley is a resilient group-based Distributed Hash Table that incorporates a
preemptive peer relocation technique and a dynamic data sharding mechanism to
enhance robustness and balance. In addition to the hard limits on group size,
defined by minimum and maximum thresholds, Parsley introduces two soft limits
that define a target interval for maintaining stable group sizes. These soft
boundaries allow the overlay to take proactive measures to prevent violations
of the hard limits, improving system stability under churn. This work provides
an in-depth analysis of the rationale behind the parameter values adopted for
Parsley's evaluation. Unlike related systems, which specify group size limits
without justification, we conduct a systematic overlay characterization study
to understand the effects of these parameters on performance and scalability.
The study examines topology operations, the behavior of large groups, and the
overall trade-offs observed, offering a grounded explanation for the chosen
configuration values.

*Sankalpa Timilsina,Susmit Shannigrahi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decentralized control plane to address limitations of centralized systems for compute placement in geographically dispersed clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome issues with centralized control methods like Kubernetes in multi-organizational settings and enable dynamic adaptations across infrastructures.

Method: Proposes the assignment of semantic names to computations to enable flexible and dynamic matching with Kubernetes service endpoints.

Result: Demonstrates that the approach allows location-independent job placement and adapts dynamically to infrastructure changes without prior cluster knowledge.

Conclusion: Decentralized control planes improve compute placement efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability in geographically distributed computing platforms.

Abstract: Scientific communities are increasingly using geographically distributed
computing platforms. The current methods of compute placement predominantly use
logically centralized controllers such as Kubernetes (K8s) to match tasks to
available resources. However, this centralized approach is unsuitable in
multi-organizational collaborations. Furthermore, workflows often need to use
manual configurations tailored for a single platform and cannot adapt to
dynamic changes across infrastructure. Our work introduces a decentralized
control plane for placing computations on geographically dispersed compute
clusters using semantic names. We assign semantic names to computations to
match requests with named Kubernetes (K8s) service endpoints. We show that this
approach provides multiple benefits. First, it allows placement of
computational jobs to be independent of location, enabling any cluster with
sufficient resources to execute the computation. Second, it facilitates dynamic
compute placement without requiring prior knowledge of cluster locations or
predefined configurations.

*Sankalpa Timilsina,Susmit Shannigrahi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a network-aware job scheduler using supervised learning to predict job completion times, improving accuracy and performance in distributed cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor job placement and inefficiencies in distributed cloud environments caused by network congestion, asymmetric bandwidth, and data shuffling.

Method: The system utilizes real-time telemetry and a trained supervised learning model to predict job durations and ranks nodes for optimal placement.

Result: Experimentation on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster showed a 34-54% improvement in node selection accuracy using the proposed scheduler compared to the default Kubernetes scheduler.

Conclusion: Supervised learning effectively enhances network-aware job scheduling in distributed clouds, improving performance and job placement efficiency.

Abstract: Distributed cloud environments hosting data-intensive applications often
experience slowdowns due to network congestion, asymmetric bandwidth, and
inter-node data shuffling. These factors are typically not captured by
traditional host-level metrics like CPU or memory. Scheduling without
accounting for these conditions can lead to poor placement decisions, longer
data transfers, and suboptimal job performance. We present a network-aware job
scheduler that uses supervised learning to predict the completion time of
candidate jobs. Our system introduces a prediction-and-ranking mechanism that
collects real-time telemetry from all nodes, uses a trained supervised model to
estimate job duration per node, and ranks them to select the best placement. We
evaluate the scheduler on a geo-distributed Kubernetes cluster deployed on the
FABRIC testbed by running network-intensive Spark workloads. Compared to the
default Kubernetes scheduler, which makes placement decisions based on current
resource availability alone, our proposed supervised scheduler achieved 34-54%
higher accuracy in selecting optimal nodes for job placement. The novelty of
our work lies in the demonstration of supervised learning for real-time,
network-aware job scheduling on a multi-site cluster.

### [160] [On Reduction and Synthesis of Petri's Cycloids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21493)
*Rüdiger Valk,Daniel Moldt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of cycloids, a special category of Petri nets, for modeling synchronized sequential processes and introduces a method for determining cycloid isomorphism efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a formal structure to describe synchronized sequential processes algebraically, improving understanding and analysis in general systems theory.

Method: Reduction systems are used in the style of rewriting systems, and properties of irreducible cycloids are analyzed. Additionally, methods for synthesizing parameters and decision procedures for cycloid isomorphism are developed.

Result: The study establishes the synthesis of cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure and provides an efficient decision method for determining cycloid isomorphism.

Conclusion: Cycloids offer a robust algebraic formalism for modeling synchronized processes, and the derived decision procedure for cycloid isomorphism enhances practical computational methods in Petri nets.

Abstract: Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions and
events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri's general systems theory. Defined
by four parameters they provide an algebraic formalism to describe strongly
synchronized sequential processes. To further investigate their structure,
reduction systems of cycloids are defined in the style of rewriting systems and
properties of irreducible cycloids are proved. In particular the synthesis of
cycloid parameters from their Petri net structure is derived, leading to an
efficient method for a decision procedure for cycloid isomorphism.

### [161] [Distributed $(Δ+1)$-Coloring in Graphs of Bounded Neighborhood Independence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21549)
*Marc Fuchs,Fabian Kuhn*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring for a specific family of graphs, improving the algorithmic bounds for graphs with low neighborhood independence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance understanding of deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in distributed graph algorithms, focusing on special graph families where faster algorithms might already exist.

Method: The authors analyze graphs based on their neighborhood independence parameter $\theta$, revisiting prior works and introducing improved algorithms.

Result: In graphs with neighborhood independence $\theta$, $(\Delta+1)$-coloring complexity is significantly reduced to quasipolylogarithmic time in $\Delta$ for $\theta =$ polylogarithmic values.

Conclusion: The work advances bounds on distributed coloring algorithms for specific graph families, pushing deterministic complexities closer to optimality.

Abstract: The distributed coloring problem is arguably one of the key problems studied
in the area of distributed graph algorithms. The most standard variant of the
problem asks for a proper vertex coloring of a graph with $\Delta+1$ colors,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. Despite an immense amount of
work on distributed coloring problems in the distributed setting, determining
the deterministic complexity of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring in the standard message
passing model remains one of the most important open questions of the area. In
this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the deterministic complexity
of $(\Delta+1)$-coloring as a function of $\Delta$ in a special family of
graphs for which significantly faster algorithms are already known. The
neighborhood independence $\theta$ of a graph is the maximum number of pairwise
non-adjacent neighbors of some node of the graph. In general, in graphs of
neighborhood independence $\theta=O(1)$ (e.g., line graphs), it is known that
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring can be solved in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log\Delta})}+O(\log^* n)$
rounds. In the present paper, we significantly improve this result, and we show
that in graphs of neighborhood independence $\theta$, a $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
can be computed in $(\theta\cdot\log\Delta)^{O(\log\log\Delta /
\log\log\log\Delta)}+O(\log^* n)$ rounds and thus in quasipolylogarithmic time
in $\Delta$ as long as $\theta$ is at most polylogarithmic in $\Delta$. We also
show that the known approach that leads to a polylogarithmic in $\Delta$
algorithm for $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring already fails for edge colorings of
hypergraphs of rank at least $3$.

*Zhuojin Li,Marco Paolieri,Leana Golubchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods for reducing inference latency of deep neural networks on mobile devices by enabling collaborative execution between CPUs and GPUs using a lightweight synchronization mechanism and machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices, focusing on reducing inference latency in environments with limited computing resources.

Method: The approach includes developing a lightweight synchronization mechanism using OpenCL's fine-grained shared virtual memory and deploying machine learning models to predict execution times of CPU and GPU assigned tasks.

Result: Evaluation on four mobile platforms demonstrated up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers in CPU-GPU co-execution strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed solution effectively reduces inference latency and optimizes collaboration between CPU and GPU for deep neural networks on mobile devices.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

### [163] [Incentivizing Consistent, Effective and Scalable Reasoning Capability in Audio LLMs via Reasoning Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20867)
*Jiajun Fan,Roger Ren,Jingyuan Li,Rahul Pandey,Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar,Ivan Bulyko,Ankur Gandhe,Ge Liu,Yile Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CESAR, a method to address reasoning challenges in Audio Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance and transforming reasoning into a strength rather than a limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of test-time inverse scaling in Audio LLMs, where reasoning processes degrade performance due to hallucinatory and inconsistent reasoning stemming from inadequate training.

Method: The CESAR framework uses a reward-based reinforcement learning strategy, called Group Relative Policy Optimization, to incentivize reasoning correctness, consistency, causal reasoning, domain knowledge, and calibrated depth.

Result: CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, achieves state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, approaches human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks, and improves reasoning and multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: CESAR establishes a scalable and robust approach to enhance reasoning in Audio LLMs, turning reasoning into a beneficial feature and advancing the state of Audio LLMs.

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

### [164] [Crisis-Resilient Portfolio Management via Graph-based Spatio-Temporal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20868)
*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRISP, a graph-based, spatio-temporal learning framework for financial time series forecasting with adaptive market dynamics detection during crises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial forecasting requires understanding changing asset correlations during crises, which existing methods fail to capture due to their reliance on static graph topologies.

Method: CRISP uses Graph Convolutional Networks for spatial relationships, BiLSTM for temporal dynamics, and multi-head Graph Attention Networks to learn sparse, adaptive structures.

Result: CRISP outperformed static methods with robust predictions in crisis settings from 2005-2024, improving Sharpe ratio by 94% and filtering irrelevant data effectively.

Conclusion: CRISP adapts to changing regimes, enabling interpretable forecasts and profitable portfolio adjustments during financial crises.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

*Lam Ngo,Huong Ha,Jeffrey Chan,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MOBO-OSD, a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm for generating diverse Pareto solutions. It employs orthogonal search directions (OSDs) and Pareto Front Estimation to enhance solution diversity and hypervolume performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of multi-objective optimization in Bayesian Optimization, an area that has received less research focus compared to single-objective optimization.

Method: MOBO-OSD utilizes multiple constrained optimization problems along orthogonal search directions (defined by an approximated convex hull of individual objective minima). It incorporates Pareto Front Estimation for additional solution density and supports batch optimization operations for efficiency.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks (with objectives ranging from two to six) show that MOBO-OSD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD effectively enhances performance in multi-objective Bayesian Optimization by ensuring diversity, improving hypervolume, and enabling parallel processing. The implementation is open source and accessible.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Result: The framework integrates local environmental factors and promotes multi-agent coordination, showing promise for scalable and proactive disaster preparedness in mountainous regions.

Conclusion: CC-GRMAS is a proactive and scalable solution, improving landslide forecasting and disaster response, potentially enhancing climate resilience in vulnerable areas.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and
human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing
access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster
response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a
framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental
signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is
structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution,
which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response
planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and
operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and
proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across
vulnerable mountainous terrains.

### [167] [Multimodal Negative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20877)
*Baoquan Gong,Xiyuan Gao,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Bing Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in multimodal learning systems by introducing a novel paradigm called Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL), which aims to enhance weak modalities without over-aligning them with dominant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address modality imbalance in multimodal learning, where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones, compromising their unique contributions.

Method: Introduces 'Learning Not to be' (Negative Learning), where dominant modalities guide weak ones to suppress non-target classes, preserving unique information and stabilizing decision-making.

Result: The MNL framework tightens robustness lower bounds, improves unimodal confidence margins, and reduces empirical errors of weaker modalities, particularly in noisy and imbalanced scenarios.

Conclusion: MNL proves effective in preserving the distinct contributions of weak modalities, improving robustness and accuracy, as demonstrated across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: Introduces HA-RAG, optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation by reducing memory and latency overhead using hotness-aware techniques with significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and high latency in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems caused by external knowledge bases.

Method: Leverages hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and data placement strategies to improve KV chunk access efficiency.

Result: HA-RAG achieves an average 2.10x speedup and maximum 10.49x speedup in Time-To-First-Token with minimal accuracy loss compared to TurboRAG.

Conclusion: HA-RAG optimization system effectively enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation performance with better efficiency without compromising accuracy significantly.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

*Xingyu Wang,Chang-Han Rhee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the global dynamics of heavy-tailed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and shows its ability to avoid sharp minimum regions in loss landscapes, promoting better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and enhance SGD's empirical ability to avoid sharp local minima which lead to poor generalization in AI models.

Method: The authors utilize recent advancements in large deviations and metastability analysis, combined with injecting and truncating heavy-tailed noise during training and applying gradient clipping.

Result: Heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds flatter local minima and improves generalization performance, supported by simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: Heavy-tailed SGD techniques improve training dynamics by avoiding sharp minima, contributing to better test data generalization in deep learning models.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

*Rattana Pukdee,Ziqi Ke,Chirag Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses regression problems with interval targets rather than traditional exact values, proposing novel loss functions and min-max learning formulation for improved outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the challenge posed by applications where exact regression targets are expensive or impossible to determine due to uncertainty.

Method: The authors propose interval-compatible loss functions with established generalization bounds and a novel min-max learning approach that considers worst-case maximum target values.

Result: The proposed methods show state-of-the-art performance in experiments conducted on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The paper opens new pathways for regression tasks involving interval targets, demonstrating improved performance and robustness through advanced theoretical and empirical approaches.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

*Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Yue Su,Janghoon Ock,Alan Pham,Sanya Ahuja,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first use of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and a novel mutation encoding strategy to improve protein mutation property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the prediction of protein mutation properties, which is crucial for drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine, by addressing poor cross-dataset generalization in current approaches.

Method: The authors employ transformer architectures with MAML for rapid task adaptation and introduce a new strategy using separator tokens to encode mutations directly into sequence context.

Result: The method showcased improved performance and efficiency, achieving better accuracy and reduced training time across diverse datasets for functional fitness, thermal stability, and solubility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances protein mutation analysis, enabling efficient cross-domain generalization and industrial applications with limited experimental data availability.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

### [172] [LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952)
*Sungjun Cho,Changho Shin,Suenggwan Jo,Xinya Yan,Shourjo Aditya Chaudhuri,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic framework called LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), which synergizes Bayesian state space models and large language models for multimodal temporal forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting methods struggle with fixed input/output horizons, and lack capability to incorporate and process both structured time-series and unstructured textual information. There is also a need to model and quantify uncertainty effectively in prediction.

Method: The authors propose LBS, a fusion of state space models (SSM) for capturing latent state dynamics and large language models (LLM) for encoding textual inputs and generating textual forecasts. This framework allows flexible forecasting windows, uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization.

Result: LBS demonstrated a 13.20% improvement over previous state-of-the-art on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark. Additionally, it generates human-readable summaries accompanying each forecast.

Conclusion: LBS combines textual and numerical predictions, enabling multimodal temporal reasoning and setting a novel standard with its generalization capabilities and ability to quantify uncertainty effectively.

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

### [173] [Safety Assessment in Reinforcement Learning via Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20955)
*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using reversibility and model-predictive path integral control for ensuring safety in model-free reinforcement learning, without requiring explicit knowledge of dynamics or safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-free reinforcement learning lacks formal safety guarantees and struggles with safety issues best characterized by invariance.

Method: Uses reversibility and model-predictive path integral control to assess action safety during training, requiring only black-box dynamics queries.

Result: The algorithm prevents unsafe actions while maintaining comparable training progress to baseline PPO methods that violate safety.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an effective balance of safety and training performance, even without explicit dynamics or constraints knowledge.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

*Sizhe Rao,Runqiu Zhang,Sajal Saha,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPFL framework proposes an advanced privacy-preserving fall detection system, leveraging wearable sensors and federated learning for improved accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of generalizability, privacy concerns, and individual variability in traditional fall detection systems.

Method: Introduced EPFL framework using federated learning, homomorphic encryption, and Specialized Weighted Aggregation strategy for wearable sensor data analysis.

Result: Achieved superior performance on a benchmark fall detection dataset, with Recall of 88.31% and F1-score of 89.94%, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: EPFL offers a secure, scalable, and adaptable fall detection solution suitable for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

### [175] [Towards Scalable Oversight with Collaborative Multi-Agent Debate in Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20963)
*Yongqiang Chen,Gang Niu,James Cheng,Bo Han,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative multi-agent debate (ColMAD) protocol for improving error detection in large language models by reframing debate as a non-zero-sum game.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability of error detection in LLM outputs by addressing limitations in self-diagnosis and the shortcomings of competitive multi-agent debate systems.

Method: Developed the ColMAD protocol, encouraging collaboration and constructive criticism among multiple agents to enhance evidence-based conclusions for error detection.

Result: ColMAD outperformed competitive MAD by 19% and improved upon single-agent methods in detecting errors.

Conclusion: A collaborative approach to multi-agent debate enables more accurate error detection and offers potential for improving oversight mechanisms in advanced language models.

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces three open-source libraries for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in Julia and Python, aimed at improving reproducibility and experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recurrent neural network (RNN) implementations lack a centralized, standardized library, making experimentation, reproducibility, and exploration difficult.

Method: Three libraries—torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and LuxRecurrentLayers.jl—were developed to provide consistent frameworks for building and extending RNN models, along with customization features.

Result: These libraries help centralize RNN variations, streamline experimentation, and improve reproducibility in sequence modeling applications.

Conclusion: By contributing these open-source libraries, the authors address challenges in RNN research and application, facilitating better exploration and development of RNN architectures.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address
challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients. However, no central
library is available to test these variations, and reimplementing diverse
architectures can be time-consuming and error-prone, limiting reproducibility
and exploration. Here, we introduce three open-source libraries in Julia and
Python that centralize numerous recurrent cell implementations and higher-level
recurrent architectures. torchrecurrent, RecurrentLayers.jl, and
LuxRecurrentLayers.jl offer a consistent framework for constructing and
extending RNN models, providing built-in mechanisms for customization and
experimentation. All packages are available under the MIT license and actively

*Yassine El Ouahidi,Jonathan Lys,Philipp Thölke,Nicolas Farrugia,Bastien Pasdeloup,Vincent Gripon,Karim Jerbi,Giulia Lioi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REVE, an EEG foundation model designed to generalize across diverse datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in EEG foundation models, which struggle to generalize due to heterogeneous datasets collected under diverse protocols and setups.

Method: The authors propose REVE, using a 4D positional encoding and a masked autoencoding pretraining strategy on 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets and 25,000 subjects.

Result: REVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 downstream EEG tasks, demonstrating strong generalization and effective spatio-temporal modeling without extensive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that REVE sets a new benchmark for EEG pretraining, supporting standardized research and progress in clinical neuroscience through open resources like code and pretrained weights.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

*Konstantinos Christopher Tsiolis,Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Murat A. Erdogdu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between learning rates and sample complexity in gradient-based neural network algorithms, uncovering key dynamics in feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, particularly how learning rates affect the sample complexity of different gradient-based methods.

Method: The authors propose and analyze a framework that characterizes how learning rate choices impact learning dynamics and sample complexity. They examine both correlational and non-correlational update regimes and introduce a novel layer-wise training approach using two learning rate timescales.

Result: Key findings include the identification of a phase transition in sample complexity, depending on the magnitude of learning rates, and validation over various gradient-based methods and novel training algorithms.

Conclusion: The choice of learning rate is crucial in determining statistical and computational efficiency in gradient-based learning methods, and understanding these dynamics can optimize neural network training.

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

*Yanzhi Chen,Zijing Ou,Adrian Weller,Michael U. Gutmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new mutual information estimator balancing flexibility and simplicity, demonstrating better performance across synthetic and real-world data benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in mutual information estimation where existing methods either require large data for complex models or fail with oversimplified ones.

Method: The authors utilize vector copula theory to create a principled interpolation approach between flexible and simplified models for better trade-offs.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets indicate improved performance of the proposed estimation method.

Conclusion: The proposed estimator offers an effective balance between model complexity and capacity for improved mutual information estimation.

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

TL;DR: The paper addresses catastrophic forgetting in federated learning for time series forecasting, introducing the first benchmarking framework and evaluating CF mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat catastrophic forgetting in federated learning scenarios with non-i.i.d. time series data, a use case relevant to IoT and edge computing but underexplored in current literature.

Method: The study uses the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset with 12 decentralized clients to benchmark CF mitigation methods like Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic Intelligence.

Result: A new benchmark for CF in time series FL is established, and a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art CF mitigation methods is provided, along with a reproducible open-source framework.

Conclusion: The provided framework and findings serve as foundational tools to advance federated continual learning in time-series forecasting environments.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces A-GPS, a framework for online multi-objective optimization that efficiently approximates Pareto sets while allowing preference customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize multi-objective problems in an efficient and preference-aware manner while avoiding costly computations such as explicit hypervolume calculations.

Method: Proposes A-GPS framework using a generative model conditioned on user preferences, a class probability estimator for predicting non-dominance, and preference direction vectors to incorporate subjective trade-offs.

Result: Demonstrates the effectiveness of A-GPS in achieving high-quality Pareto approximations with strong sample efficiency and successful integration of user preferences, validated through benchmarks and protein design tasks.

Conclusion: A-GPS simplifies multi-objective optimization, offers efficient solutions with preference customization, and eliminates the need for explicit hypervolume computations.

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

*Jubilee Lee,Daniele E. Schiavazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of implicit neural representations (INRs) for compressing cardiovascular data and anatomy representation, achieving high compression ratios and low errors using advanced strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the accuracy of implicit neural representations (INRs) for domain-specific applications, particularly in compressing hemodynamic fields and representing cardiovascular anatomies.

Method: The study evaluates INRs using hemodynamic field data and anatomical modeling via signed distance functions. Various strategies to address spectral bias are used, including advanced activation functions, positional encoding, and kernel combinations.

Result: INRs achieved high compression ratios (~230) for aortic hemodynamic data with minor error margins. For 48 aortic anatomies, deviations were notably low (<1.6 mm). The best-performing architectures were SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and MHE.

Conclusion: INRs are highly effective for cardiovascular data representation and compression, combining resolution independence, memory efficiency, and excellent accuracy.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces L2M3OF, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) designed to enhance material discovery, especially for Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). It integrates structural and textual representations to improve understanding and predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in using text-based LLMs for scientific discovery, especially functional material design such as MOFs, which require nuanced structural and textual understanding beyond language-based representations.

Method: L2M3OF combines crystal representation learning with language understanding, employing a pre-trained crystal encoder and a token compression layer for multimodal integration. It creates a database for training and benchmarks its performance against advanced closed-source LLMs.

Result: L2M3OF surpassed top-performing closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks specific to crystalline materials, demonstrating efficiency with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The study underscores the value of multimodal approaches for advancing material design and portrays L2M3OF as a transformative tool for future AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

### [184] [Reducing the Probability of Undesirable Outputs in Language Models Using Probabilistic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21184)
*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RePULSe, a training method that improves reinforcement learning alignment in language models, achieving a better balance between desirable and undesirable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to align language models with human preferences and optimize desirable outputs without significantly compromising average-case performance.

Method: The authors propose RePULSe, which augments the standard reinforcement learning loss with an additional loss function. This function uses learned proposals to guide sampling of low-reward outputs, subsequently reducing their probabilities.

Result: RePULSe demonstrates a better tradeoff between expected reward and the probability of generating undesired outputs. It also shows improved adversarial robustness compared to standard RL approaches and alternatives.

Conclusion: RePULSe is a promising alternative for training language models that require alignment with specific objectives, optimizing for reward while simultaneously minimizing unwanted outputs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

TL;DR: MeDyate enables efficient on-device neural network fine-tuning under tight memory constraints using dynamic subnetwork adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapt on-device pre-trained models to downstream tasks despite limited memory resources.

Method: Framework introduces LaRa for layer ranking and dynamic channel sampling for memory-efficient adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results under extreme memory constraints across various tasks and architectures.

Conclusion: MeDyate effectively supports fine-tuning with minimal memory requirements and enhances on-device learning capabilities.

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu,Jiamang Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ), an efficient quantization method for large language models intended to reduce resource usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models require extensive resources, making them inefficient, especially in resource-constrained settings. Standard post-training quantization methods often lead to performance losses, particularly in low-bit scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the GLVQ framework where weight groups are assigned customized lattice codebooks defined by learnable generation matrices. They address non-differentiability through Babai rounding for stable optimization, enabling efficient quantization.

Result: Experiments show GLVQ achieves a better model size-accuracy trade-off compared to existing quantization baselines, making it effective for deploying large models with limited resources.

Conclusion: GLVQ effectively improves post-training quantization of large language models, providing a practical and efficient solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

*Tobias Fuchs,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of noisy real-world data, specifically partial-label learning (PLL), by proposing a probabilistic framework that enhances accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often contains noise and ambiguity, exemplified by conflicting labels in crowdsourced datasets. This poses challenges for classifier training in PLL scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a novel framework using amortized variational inference to approximate posterior distributions of true labels. Neural networks predict variational parameters for efficient inference.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in accuracy and efficiency, as evidenced by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: This approach effectively combines deep learning with probabilistic rigor, offering improved scalability and adaptability while addressing the PLL problem.

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a BiGRU-enhanced Transformer model to improve GPU memory demand predictions in deep learning. Comparative experiments show outperforming accuracy and performance over traditional machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising need for precise GPU memory demand predictions in deep learning tasks motivated this study to develop more efficient forecasting models for resource optimization.

Method: The proposed method integrates Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) into the Transformer architecture, validated through comparative experiments against traditional machine learning models like decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and performance of the BiGRU-optimized Transformer model, with the lowest MSE, RMSE values, balanced MAE, and R2 scores surpassing benchmark models.

Conclusion: The BiGRU-enhanced Transformer model effectively improves GPU memory prediction accuracy, making it reliable for resource scheduling in deep learning tasks and enhancing computing cluster utilization.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

*Xuan Tang,Jichu Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first theoretical framework for analyzing adaptive optimizers like Adam and Muon under floating-point quantization and derives convergence rates for non-convex objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid scaling of large language models demands efficient low-precision training to manage memory and enable larger models, yet theoretical understanding of why it works is lacking.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework analyzing convergence under quantization errors for gradients, weights, and optimizer states. They derive convergence rates under stochastic gradient assumptions and explore the impact of quantization errors.

Result: Both Adam and Muon retain convergence rates close to full precision when mantissa length scales logarithmically with iterations. Muon is less sensitive to quantization errors compared to Adam.

Conclusion: The study enhances theoretical understanding of low-precision training, showing trade-offs and robustness of different adaptive optimization algorithms.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional Lagrangian duality in solving non-convex constrained learning problems, focusing on improving feasibility, optimality, and generalization outcomes.

Result: Proven dual ascent convergence under mild conditions, PAC-style generalization guarantees, and successful application in fairness classification tasks.

Conclusion: Augmented Lagrangian methods are effective tools to handle constraints in non-convex settings and achieve fair, optimal machine learning outcomes.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal
modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework for supervising complex models, addressing challenges posed by distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The supervision of increasingly complex future models may surpass human capabilities, necessitating effective frameworks for weak-to-strong generalization in various tasks.

Method: RAVEN dynamically learns optimal combinations of weak models and adjusts the parameters of strong models to enable robust weak-to-strong generalization.

Result: RAVEN achieves over 30% improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and performs comparably or better than existing methods on in-distribution tasks. It assigns higher weights to more accurate weak models.

Conclusion: The RAVEN framework enhances supervision of complex models under distribution shifts, showcasing trustworthy and effective weak-to-strong generalization.

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework based on Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) to train spiking neural networks (SNNs) for binary classification, emphasizing high precision and low false alarm rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop efficient, sparse, and high-performance SNNs suitable for tasks requiring step-wise prediction and robustness, especially in detecting low signal-to-noise ratio events.

Method: Utilizes the EONS algorithm to jointly optimize architectures and parameters of SNNs. Input data is encoded as spike trains, predictions are made using spike counts, and ensemble methods are incorporated for enhanced performance.

Result: The framework is applied to radioactive detection and seizure detection datasets, outperforming PCA and deep learning baselines with fewer neurons and synapses. Hardware deployment on microCaspian demonstrates low power consumption and latency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves efficient and robust binary classification using sparse SNNs for various domains, showcasing high generalizability and practical deployment feasibility.

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

*Yunuo Zhang,Baiting Luo,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Gabor Karsai,Abhishek Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT is a novel particle-based framework for accurately modeling complex belief distributions in POMDPs, using temporal consistency and correlation-aware innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in accurately representing complex belief distributions in realistic environments during decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: ESCORT combines Stein-variational gradient descent (SVGD) with correlation-aware projections and temporal consistency constraints.

Result: ESCORT outperforms existing methods in belief approximation accuracy and decision-making quality through evaluations on POMDP tasks and synthetic distributions.

Conclusion: ESCORT effectively handles high-dimensional, multi-modal belief spaces, avoiding degeneracy and adapting without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

*Enshu Liu,Qian Chen,Xuefei Ning,Shengen Yan,Guohao Dai,Zinan Lin,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2) to enable high-performance one-step sampling for image auto-regressive models, achieving faster generation speeds with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image auto-regressive models are powerful but face challenges with slow generation speeds due to multiple sampling steps. Current solutions like DD1 have limitations in one-step sampling and lack flexibility due to reliance on pre-defined mappings.

Method: The proposed DD2 method introduces a new conditional score distillation loss where a separate network predicts scores for latent embeddings, training a one-step generator without relying on pre-defined mappings.

Result: Experimental results show DD2 achieves one-step sampling with marginal FID increase (3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256), reduces performance degradation by 67% compared to DD1, and accelerates training by up to 12.3 times.

Conclusion: DD2 significantly advances one-step sampling for image AR models, improving efficiency while maintaining quality, and demonstrates strong potential for rapid, high-fidelity AR generation.

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Motivation: The authors aim to improve generalization in fine-tuned pre-trained models for new tasks with minimal data, addressing limitations in current reparameterization methods like LoRA.

Method: The paper proposes a new reparameterization class using Random Matrix Theory to augment model training for better generalization, tested in binary classification and LLM fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method achieves improved generalization in fine-tuned models, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Conclusion: This new reparameterization method is effective in enhancing the transfer learning capabilities, paving the way for better model adaptation to novel tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models
to perform better on new desired tasks with minimal data samples. Among the
most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address demographic disparities in representation learning to prevent unfairness in downstream tasks while ensuring robustness.

Method: Develop the Fair Representation learning with high-confidence Guarantees (FRG) framework that uses an optimized adversarial model to bound unfairness reliably.

Result: Empirical results on three real-world datasets reveal that FRG consistently controls unfairness and outperforms six state-of-the-art methods across various tasks and models.

Conclusion: FRG effectively ensures high-confidence fairness in representation learning, offering a robust solution for equitable downstream predictions.

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

*Wanhao Yu,Zheng Wang,Shuteng Niu,Sen Lin,Li Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores zeroth-order (ZO) optimization for continual learning (CL), addressing the stability-plasticity trade-off and proposing a hybrid approach (ZO-FC) that balances stability and adaptability for memory-efficient on-device CL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises to optimize memory efficiency while tackling the stability-plasticity-efficiency trade-off in continual learning, especially where gradient computation is impractical.

Method: The paper employs theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation of ZO optimization in continual learning, developing ZO-FC, a hybrid approach combining ZO optimization for an adapter-based module and FO updates for the classifier.

Result: The results show ZO optimization naturally stabilizes loss landscapes to reduce forgetting but limits plasticity. The proposed ZO-FC approach achieves a balance between stability and plasticity with minimal memory cost.

Conclusion: ZO-FC effectively addresses the trade-off in continual learning by providing stability benefits of ZO optimization while retaining adaptability of FO optimization, offering a practical, memory-efficient solution for on-device applications.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to quantify epistemic uncertainty in generative flow networks induced by noisy reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative flow networks sample complex objects sequentially based on reward functions, which can often be noisy and lead to uncertainty in the policies.

Method: The paper introduces a surrogate model using polynomial chaos expansion, fit on an ensemble of trained generative flow networks, to model epistemic uncertainty.

Result: The proposed approach effectively estimates policy uncertainty using inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling demonstrated through various experiments like grid-world tasks, symbolic regression, and structure learning.

Conclusion: Quantifying uncertainty in generative flow networks enables more robust decision-making in scenarios of noisy or approximate rewards, enhancing their utility in diverse applications.

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

*Faisal Hamman,Pasan Dissanayake,Yanjun Fu,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation (CoD), a strategy for few-shot knowledge distillation that uses counterfactual explanations to enhance data efficiency and distillation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of transferring knowledge from complex teacher models to resource-efficient student models in scenarios where large quantities of labeled data are unavailable.

Method: The proposed method leverages counterfactual explanations, which are inputs causing minimal changes but flipping a teacher's output, to systematically map its decision boundary with fewer data samples. The authors provide statistical and geometric theoretical guarantees for this approach.

Result: Experiments show CoD achieves superior performance in few-shot regimes (8-512 samples), surpassing existing methods while needing fewer samples (half of those used by baselines).

Conclusion: Counterfactual explanations effectively improve few-shot distillation by supplying informative examples that enhance the mimicry of teacher models' decision boundaries, making the approach more efficient and performant.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CIPHER offers an efficient framework to label complex time series by combining symbolic representations, clustering, and expert input, addressing annotation challenges in physical sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of labeling time series data in physical sciences, where expert annotations are limited, costly, and inconsistent.

Method: The CIPHER framework uses interpretable compression and indexing with iSAX, clustering via HDBSCAN, and a human-in-the-loop process for expert validation. Labels from domain scientists are propagated across clusters for scalable classification.

Result: Applied to solar wind phenomena classification in OMNI data, CIPHER successfully identifies key patterns such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions.

Conclusion: CIPHER provides a scalable and systematic approach for time series labeling in physical sciences and demonstrates potential beyond the specific case study. The code is open for reproducibility.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

### [201] [Optimal Graph Clustering without Edge Density Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21669)
*Maximilien Dreveton,Elaine Siyu Liu,Matthias Grossglauser,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM) for graph clustering, characterizing its optimal error rate and showing its advantages over existing models like SBM and DCBM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing graph clustering models, particularly related to degree and connectivity pattern heterogeneity, which are not captured by models like SBM and DCBM.

Method: The authors analyze PABM's theoretical properties, deriving error rates for clustering under this model, and conduct numerical experiments with spectral clustering using $k^2$ eigenvectors for better structural representation.

Result: They demonstrate that PABM enables successful clustering even under conditions where traditional models fail, as PABM accounts for intra- and inter-cluster popularity differences. Numerical results show that algorithms using $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional methods on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: PABM offers a more nuanced framework for graph clustering, emphasizing local connectivity features and enriching understanding of clustering hardness compared to traditional models.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

*Qingsong Xu,Jonathan L Bamber,Nils Thuerey,Niklas Boers,Paul Bates,Gustau Camps-Valls,Yilei Shi,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework called PCNO and its enhancement DiffPCNO are developed for accurate, physically consistent, and uncertainty-aware long-term spatiotemporal forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving accurate long-term spatiotemporal forecasts is challenging, especially since many machine learning methods ignore physical laws and fail to handle inherent uncertainties.

Method: PCNO projects model outputs onto function spaces that comply with predefined physical laws using a physics-consistent projection layer. DiffPCNO extends this by incorporating a diffusion model for uncertainty quantification and mitigation.

Result: PCNO and DiffPCNO provide high-fidelity and physically consistent predictions across various systems and spatial resolutions, proving effective in applications like turbulent flow and flood forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enable robust and versatile spatiotemporal forecasting while adhering to physical laws and addressing uncertainties.

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

*Tobias Schmidt,Steffen Schneider,Matthias Bethge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Equivariance by Contrast (EbC), a method for learning equivariant embeddings from group-action observation pairs, and validates it on datasets with structured transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for general-purpose learning of equivariant embeddings based solely on observed group actions without requiring specific inductive biases.

Method: EbC jointly learns a latent space and group representation where group actions are invertible linear maps, validated on synthetic and dSprites datasets with theoretical identifiability proof.

Result: The approach demonstrated high-fidelity equivariance on datasets, including experiments with diverse group types such as non-abelian and affine transformation groups.

Conclusion: EbC provides a novel framework for encoder-only equivariant learning from observation pairs, showing promising results for structured transformation modeling and computer vision applications.

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

*Gereon Elvers,Gilad Landau,Oiwi Parker Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a privacy-conscious task for brain-computer interface benchmarking. It proposes a standardized evaluation and dataset, achieving promising results with the release of reference models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain-computer interface benchmarks mainly target foundational tasks, and practical application tasks like converting brain signals to text are still insufficiently addressed.

Method: The study uses the LibriBrain corpus for benchmarking with standardized data splits and tailored evaluation protocols, focusing on metrics such as AUPRC and false alarms per hour. It also releases supporting tools for ease of research replication.

Result: The proposed reference model achieves significant improvement in AUPRC over baseline and explores performance scaling with training hours and word-level factors influencing detectability.

Conclusion: Keyword Spotting is a viable intermediate task for brain-computer interfaces, supported by experimental data and standardized tools.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods for solving the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness guarantees by addressing fractional and multi-class challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle the limitations in resource allocation for agents belonging to multiple classes while ensuring fairness and efficiency.

Method: Developed a randomized relax-and-round algorithm with a set-aside mechanism for fairness, and proposed a learning-augmented variant to incorporate machine-learned predictions.

Result: The proposed methods achieve fairness across classes, maintain performance, and adapt to practical scenarios with predictions.

Conclusion: The work improves online resource allocation by balancing fairness and efficiency effectively, even under multi-class and prediction-influenced settings.

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization in reinforcement learning, analyzing its sample complexity under differential privacy constraints.


<details>

Motivation: To address privacy concerns in sensitive applications of policy optimization in reinforcement learning.

Method: The study formalizes a differential privacy definition tailored for policy optimization and systematically examines the sample complexity of commonly used algorithms, such as policy gradient and natural policy gradient, under various scenarios.

Result: Theoretical findings show privacy costs often appear as lower-order terms in sample complexity, with significant observations on private policy optimization settings.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights that can guide the development of privacy-preserving policy optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods struggle with analyzing the massive PSP solar wind dataset, exceeding 150 GB, which is critical for understanding solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting.

Method: The framework integrates Dask for large-scale computations and the Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method to estimate distributions of solar wind parameters and anomalies.

Result: Key trends in the inner heliosphere were revealed, such as the relationship between solar wind speed, proton density, and their role in space weather phenomena.

Conclusion: This methodology facilitates reproducible analysis of large physical datasets while advancing the study of solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting; tools and datasets were made publicly available.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

*Raul Cavalcante Dinardi,Bruno Yamamoto,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the effectiveness of selecting the shortest solution as a heuristic to improve reasoning tasks with LLMs, achieving competitive results with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs by finding ways to improve predictive performance without significantly increasing computational complexity.

Method: The authors propose the heuristic of selecting the shortest solution during inference, leveraging the model's behavior in concise versus verbose reasoning regimes.

Result: The shortest-answer heuristic is shown to be competitive with complex methods like self-consistency across benchmarks, while also reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: Selecting the shortest solution is a simple and effective strategy for boosting LLM reasoning performance, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates Neural Collapse (NC) in deep networks, showing its emergence in a two-layer ReLU network during gradient flow on orthogonally separable data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical basis for Neural Collapse, which describes simple, structured features emerging in the last layer representation of trained neural networks.

Method: Analyzing gradient flow dynamics on a two-layer ReLU network applied to orthogonally separable data to study the role of training dynamics' implicit biases.

Result: Proved that Neural Collapse occurs even in structured data using nonlinear activations, highlighting the role of training dynamics in NC.

Conclusion: The work relaxes prior assumptions and explores data structure effects and implicit biases in training, contributing deeper insights into Neural Collapse phenomena.

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

*Jiaqi Xue,Mayank Kumar,Yuzhang Shang,Shangqian Gao,Rui Ning,Mengxin Zheng,Xiaoqian Jiang,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes DictPFL, a privacy-preserving framework for Federated Learning that uses efficient encryption methods to minimize overhead while securing gradient sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy risks in Federated Learning posed by gradient sharing, such as gradient inversion attacks, while reducing the heavy computational and communication overhead associated with Homomorphic Encryption.

Method: DictPFL introduces two modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE) which keeps non-transmitted parameters local, and Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME) which uses history-guided pruning to minimize encrypted gradients.

Result: DictPFL achieves reduced communication costs by up to 748× and training acceleration by up to 65× compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming selective encryption methods both in overhead reduction and speed.

Conclusion: DictPFL demonstrates that Homomorphic Encryption-based Federated Learning can be made practical for real-world scenarios with minimal performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

*Xiangyang Xu,Hongyang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework, Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph, aimed at improving few-shot molecular property prediction by incorporating both global and local contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot molecular property prediction suffers from limited labeled datasets and lacks structural guidance in traditional methods. This paper aims to enhance relational inductive bias and improve knowledge transfer for drug discovery and materials science.

Method: The framework builds a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph with motif nodes representing shared chemical substructures and forms connections between motifs, molecules, and properties. Locally, each molecule-property pair is encoded with attention directed at neighboring molecules and motifs.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five FSMPP benchmarks, showcasing its capability for robust prediction through enriched context.

Conclusion: The integration of chemically meaningful global motifs with local contextual encoding leads to a more effective few-shot molecular property prediction model, paving the way for advancements in drug discovery and materials science.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of selecting a limited number of features for training models that perform well across multiple subpopulations, especially when feature collection is resource-intensive.

Method: The proposed method uses a continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection, employing a noising mechanism and optimizing the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor to ensure balanced performance without relying on backpropagation.

Result: Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world data validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing downstream modeling across subpopulations.

Conclusion: The proposed model-agnostic framework successfully balances feature selection with downstream prediction quality across multiple subpopulations, offering practical applications in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

TL;DR: SolarBoost offers a novel approach for DPV forecasting by modeling grid outputs separately and resolving computational challenges, validated successfully across multiple cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for forecasting power output in centralized photovoltaic (CPV) systems face limitations when applied to distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems due to factors like lack of grid-level data and diverse panel setups.

Method: SolarBoost models aggregated power outputs as combinations of small grid outputs, utilizing unit output functions multiplied by dynamic capacities, along with efficient algorithms addressing computational bottlenecks.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments highlight SolarBoost's superior grid-level modeling approach, with successful deployments in several cities in China showcasing reduced potential losses.

Conclusion: SolarBoost enhances power grid operations through better DPV forecasting, with practical deployment yielding significant improvements in performance and insights for grid management.

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

TL;DR: The paper addresses the MIoT's need for low-latency scheduling by introducing a two-tier reinforcement learning framework to optimize task workflows across edge, fog, and cloud layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the NP-hard challenge of minimizing makespan for sequential healthcare workflows in MIoT systems, where stringent end-to-end latency is critical.

Method: The authors propose a two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework. It includes a global controller for layer selection (cloud, fog, or edge) and local controllers for node assignments in the selected layer.

Result: The experimental results show the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods, especially as workflow complexity increases, by learning effective long-term scheduling strategies.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the complexities of MIoT scheduling, ensuring reduced makespan and demonstrating scalability and adaptability for large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing 3D molecules with desired properties for drug discovery, overcoming limitations in controlling multi-objective constraints in diffusion models.

Method: An uncertainty-aware RL framework utilizing surrogate models with uncertainty estimation to shape reward functions for optimizing molecular generation and property objectives.

Result: Improved performance over baselines in molecular quality and property optimization; MD simulations and ADMET profiling suggest drug-like behavior and binding stability of generated molecules.

Conclusion: RL-guided generative diffusion models show strong potential for advancing automated molecular design applications.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

### [216] [A Unified Matrix Factorization Framework for Classical and Robust Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21172)
*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified matrix factorization framework for classical and robust clustering, including k-means and fuzzy c-means, and proposes robust alternatives addressing outlier sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering techniques like k-means and fuzzy c-means suffer from sensitivity to outliers and lack unified optimization interpretations.

Method: The paper revisits crisp k-means as matrix factorization, develops a formalized interpretation for fuzzy c-means via matrix factorization, and introduces robust clustering formulations using the l1,2-norm. Algorithms using alternating minimization and IRLS are proposed, proving local convergence.

Result: Reformulated k-means and fuzzy c-means in a unified matrix factorization framework and developed robust clustering algorithms with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The approach advances clustering paradigms by providing unified optimization bases and robust alternatives, improving handling of outliers.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

*Shadi Aljawarneh,Juan A. Lara,Muneer Bani Yassein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a visual big data system for analyzing and predicting weather phenomena, demonstrating good predictive performance and user satisfaction among experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in meteorological data analysis, such as high data volume, dimensionality, missing values, and variable correlation, and to extract useful knowledge for weather prediction.

Method: The system integrates open data into a NoSQL database, fuses data temporally and spatially, and applies predictive analysis using univariate, multivariate approaches, and neighbor-station training for missing data.

Result: The system achieves a normalized mean squared error of 0.00013 and directional symmetry of 0.84, with positive usability ratings from experts, except for graphic design.

Conclusion: The results validate the system's effectiveness in meteorological data analysis and provide a foundation for further research and development in this domain.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

### [218] [Scalable Principal-Agent Contract Design via Gradient-Based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21177)
*Tomer Galanti,Aarya Bookseller,Korok Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bilevel max-max optimization framework for principal-agent contract design, moving beyond reliance on closed forms and enabling complex nonlinear contracts analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the analytical intractability of principal-agent contract design in realistic environments with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions.

Method: The paper develops an algorithmic framework using modern machine learning techniques for bilevel optimization, leveraging implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients for efficient hypergradient computation.

Result: The method successfully recovers known analytical optima in benchmark environments and demonstrates applicability to complex nonlinear contracts without closed-form solutions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computational tool that extends contract design capabilities, allowing for systematic study of previously intractable models.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

*Xiequn Wang,Zhan Zhuang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLAN proposes an efficient framework for continual learning by managing task-specific subspaces, incorporating orthogonal basis vectors, and using a perturbation-based strategy. This achieves state-of-the-art results in CL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the challenge of continual learning for large pre-trained models by avoiding interference and forgetting during adaptation to new tasks.

Method: PLAN extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to introduce orthogonal basis vectors and optimize them through a perturbation-based strategy. It also features a basis vector selection mechanism to reduce interference and preserve past knowledge.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CL benchmarks show PLAN outperforming existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and interference-aware fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PLAN sets a new state-of-the-art for continual learning in foundation models, showcasing effective task-specific subspace management and interference reduction.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

*Luca Demetrio,Giovanni Apruzzese,Kathrin Grosse,Pavel Laskov,Emil Lupu,Vera Rimmer,Philine Widmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GenReview, the largest dataset of LLM-written peer reviews, encompassing 81K reviews from ICLR submissions, aimed at understanding their utility and implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examine how LLMs impact scientific peer reviewing and address the lack of relevant datasets to fully understand their utility and implications.

Method: Created GenReview, a dataset of LLM-generated reviews using three independent prompts (negative, positive, neutral) linked to papers and original reviews to facilitate investigations.

Result: LLMs show bias in reviewing, can be detected automatically, inconsistently follow reviewing instructions, and align well with decisions on accepted papers.

Conclusion: GenReview provides a valuable resource to explore the implications of LLM involvement in peer reviewing, showing mixed capabilities and potential biases of these systems.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

### [221] [Online AUC Optimization Based on Second-order Surrogate Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21202)
*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a second-order surrogate loss and an efficient online algorithm to optimize AUC for classification tasks, especially in large-scale and class-imbalanced scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in minimizing AUC in classification tasks, which include the non-convexity of pairwise 0/1 losses and high memory costs for instance-wise storage in large-scale applications.

Method: A novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss is proposed, along with an efficient online algorithm. It substitutes the aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss constructed from first- and second-order statistics of training data. The framework is extended to nonlinear settings using a kernel-based formulation.

Result: The paper’s method achieves a tighter logarithmic ($\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$) regret bound compared to existing methods’ square root ($\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$) regret bound. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the method's superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed second-order surrogate loss provides an efficient and effective solution for optimizing online AUC in large-scale classification tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates synthetic priors for tabular foundation models (TFMs) based on in-context learning and introduces "Mitra," a new TFM that achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how synthetic priors influence generalization in tabular foundation models (TFMs) pre-trained on synthetic datasets.

Method: Systematic investigation of synthetic prior properties and creation of a curated mixture of priors to train the proposed "Mitra" model.

Result: "Mitra" demonstrates superior performance across classification and regression benchmarks with higher sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models like TabPFNv2 and TabICL.

Conclusion: Synthetic priors with diversity and distinctiveness are critical for boosting the generalization capabilities of TFMs, and the proposed model "Mitra" exemplifies this with improvements in benchmark performance.

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

### [223] [Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)
*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents SANI, a method to sanitize language models by removing memorized sensitive information without extensive fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of sensitive data memorization by fine-tuned large language models, leading to privacy and confidentiality risks.

Method: The proposed method, SANI, disrupts memorization through two main phases: neuron erasure to reset neurons in the last layers and repair via brief fine-tuning while avoiding memorization of sensitive data.

Result: SANI significantly reduces memorization and regurgitation of sensitive data, both in specialized models fine-tuned on medical data and standard pre-trained models, with the use of only a few additional epochs of unlearning.

Conclusion: SANI offers a cost-effective approach to sanitize large language models, assisting industries and institutions to protect sensitive data while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

TL;DR: ADaMoRE introduces a robust unsupervised graph neural network framework to improve adaptability and stability for diverse graph structures, showcasing superior efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks face limitations in adapting to diverse graph structures and tasks due to rigid architectures, prompting a need for a more flexible approach.

Method: ADaMoRE combines backbone-residual expert architecture, structurally-aware gating networks, and unified unsupervised objectives to create a Mixture-of-Experts framework with improved efficiency and stability.

Result: ADaMoRE achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning tasks, validates its performance across 16 benchmarks, and demonstrates faster training and superior generalization.

Conclusion: The paper presents ADaMoRE as a scalable and effective solution for unsupervised graph neural networks, addressing adaptability, stability, and efficiency challenges with significant empirical support.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

*Francesco Pivi,Simone Gazza,Davide Evangelista,Roberto Amadini,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to enhance the interpretability of flow matching generative models by embedding physical semantics using the 2D Ising model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching models lack interpretability in intermediate steps, which inhibits understanding of the transformations applied during generative processes.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that constrains flow steps to physical distributions, utilizing the 2D Ising model to connect flow trajectories to equilibrium states via parametric cooling schedules.

Result: The proposed method excels at preserving physical fidelity and outperforms Monte Carlo generation in speed for large lattice sizes, while ensuring meaningful stepwise transitions in the latent space.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical semantics into generative flows transforms neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes, enhancing model transparency and efficacy.

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairImagen, a debiasing framework for text-to-image diffusion models to mitigate societal biases in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The significant societal biases along demographic attributes like gender and race in text-to-image diffusion models need to be addressed to ensure fairness and equity.

Method: FairImagen modifies prompt embeddings via Fair PCA to minimize demographic bias while maintaining semantic information. It uses noise injection and unified cross-demographic projection for improved debiasing without modifying the diffusion model.

Result: FairImagen effectively reduces biases in gender, race, and intersections while maintaining moderate image quality and prompt fidelity, outperforming other post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: FairImagen offers a scalable, model-agnostic debiasing solution, allowing for fairer text-to-image generation without extensive model modifications.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing model merging methods constrained by parameter inconsistencies in combining finetuned foundation model checkpoints.

Method: The paper proposes FDAs, synthetic inputs that capture task-specific shifts by aligning induced gradients with task vectors in the input-representation space.

Result: FDAs enable effective post-training model merging, demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, and complement parameter-space merging methods.

Conclusion: FDAs bridge joint multi-task training and post-hoc merging, offering improved efficacy and adaptability in integrating knowledge from finetuned models.

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

TL;DR: The paper explores the construction of most confusing instances in RL theory using neural network world models, proposing an adversarial training method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of constructing most confusing instances for general cases in RL, enabling a better understanding of the minimal exploration needed.

Method: Formalize the problem as constrained optimization to find modified models with statistical closeness and divergent performances between policies. Employ adversarial training to achieve these modifications.

Result: Empirical study shows that achievable confusion correlates with the uncertainty in world model quality.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into exploration strategies for deep model-based RL grounded in theory and uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

TL;DR: The paper studies stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) in deep learning's lazy training regime, proving it achieves exponential convergence to an optimal solution under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the convergence and efficiency of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics in the lazy training regime for understanding training dynamics of optimization algorithms.

Method: The paper uses non-asymptotic convergence analysis and establishes the behavior of SGLD using Itô stochastic differential equations (SDE), applying regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function.

Result: It is proved that SGLD maintains a non-degenerate kernel with high probability during training and converges exponentially to the empirical risk minimizer, with finite-time and finite-width bounds.

Conclusion: SGLD is effective in achieving exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in continuous-time models, validated through numerical regression experiments.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome memory constraints and improve scalability in training Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using second-order methods for solving PDEs.

Method: Developed PINN Balls, using a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that combines ensemble models and sparse coding, along with Adversarial Adaptive Sampling for domain decomposition.

Result: PINN Balls outperformed state-of-the-art methods in scientific machine learning in terms of accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: PINN Balls offers a scalable and accurate solution rooted in solid theoretical principles for training PINNs using second-order methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

### [231] [Relieving the Over-Aggregating Effect in Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21267)
*Junshu Sun,Wanxing Chang,Chenxue Yang,Qingming Huang,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces Wideformer to tackle over-aggregating in graph attention, enhancing performance by reducing information loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning from global interactions in graph attention due to node-scale and over-aggregating, which dilutes critical information.

Method: Wideformer processes node aggregation in parallel, reduces input aggregation volume, and guides the focus on key subsets by sorting and weighting outputs.

Result: Wideformer effectively mitigates over-aggregating, enabling backbone methods to prioritize key messages and outperform baseline methods.

Conclusion: Wideformer is a plug-and-play solution to address over-aggregating in graph attention, improving both information retention and performance.

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

### [232] [Buffer layers for Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21271)
*Hyeongyu Kim,Geonhui Han,Dosik Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed Buffer layer introduces an improved Test Time Adaptation (TTA) method, overcoming limitations of normalization layer dependence while enhancing model robustness and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by normalization layer dependence in TTA, such as sensitivity to batch sizes and limitations under significant domain shifts.

Method: The paper introduces a Buffer layer which replaces normalization layer updates, preserving the pre-trained backbone and reducing catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. Its modular structure allows integration into various TTA frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments show the Buffer layer improves model robustness, mitigates domain shift effectively, and prevents forgetting, enhancing performance across numerous architectures.

Conclusion: The Buffer layer is a versatile and effective solution for real-world domain adaptation scenarios, outperforming traditional normalization-based TTA approaches and improving adaptation frameworks.

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

*Pavankumar Chandankar,Robin Burchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach using transformer models for reliable human activity recognition, significantly improving performance in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of robust human activity recognition (HAR) in noisy and real-world sensor environments by improving model generalization.

Method: The method involves training four independent PatchTST transformer models for different inertial sensor locations using noise-augmented datasets that mimic test-time conditions. The models employ techniques like randomized jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout. Final predictions are made by averaging softmax probabilities of these models.

Result: The proposed ensemble approach achieves a macro-F1 score significantly above the baseline on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge private leaderboard.

Conclusion: Test-matched data augmentation paired with transformer-based ensemble learning is an effective strategy for robust HAR in noisy scenarios.

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

*Xiyang Zhang,Chen Liang,Haoxuan Qiu,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DVC, a model that optimizes data selection for neural network training, overcoming challenges faced by existing methods in scalability, dynamic modeling, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for MLP training are limited by oversimplifying transformations, ignoring hidden layer contributions, and struggling with scalability in large networks. The paper aims to address these shortcomings.

Method: DVC utilizes a hierarchical approach to data evaluation by decomposing contributions into Layer Value Contribution and Global Value Contribution. It employs metrics across quality, relevance, and diversity, coupled with an Upper Confidence Bound algorithm for adaptive data selection.

Result: Experiments across six datasets and eight baselines show that DVC consistently achieves superior accuracy and F1 scores under budget constraints, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: DVC establishes a systematic approach for hierarchical data evaluation in neural networks. It provides both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits for optimizing large-scale machine learning systems effectively.

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

### [235] [Additive Models Explained: A Computational Complexity Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21292)
*Shahaf Bassan,Michal Moshkovitz,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the computational complexity of generating explanations for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), revealing a varying landscape of complexity based on inputs, component models, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the assumption that GAMs, often regarded as interpretable, can have explanations generated efficiently across various configurations.

Method: Analyzing the computational complexity of generating explanations for GAMs under diverse settings such as input structure, component models, and tasks like regression vs classification.

Result: The analysis uncovers varying complexities influenced by the input space structure, component models employed, task type, and even benefits from expressing certain models additively.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical insights into when explanation generation for GAMs is feasible or computationally challenging, contributing to a deeper understanding of their interpretability.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

*Sukanya Patra,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EPHAD introduces a test-time adaptation framework improving anomaly detection models trained on contaminated datasets by integrating multimodal evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection models often assume clean data, yet real-world datasets frequently contain anomalies, degrading detection performance. Current solutions require access to training pipelines or specific prior knowledge, limiting practical use.

Method: EPHAD updates anomaly detection model outputs using multimodal evidence at test time, combining insights from foundation models, classical detection techniques, and domain-specific knowledge.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate EPHAD's effectiveness and robustness against varying contamination levels, supported by comprehensive studies and ablation analysis.

Conclusion: EPHAD showcases adaptability and reliability in anomaly detection under challenging circumstances, with reproducible results thanks to open-source code.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

*Prakhar Ganesh,Hsiang Hsu,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how small variations in datasets impact model multiplicity, showing surprising findings about inter-class distribution overlap and proposing new methods for active learning and data imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the impact of data variations, especially single data-point differences, on model multiplicity, addressing an overlooked area in machine learning research.

Method: The study introduces a neighbouring datasets framework and uses rigorous proofs to analyze multiplicity. It extends the framework to active learning and data imputation, proposing novel, multiplicity-aware methods.

Result: The research reveals that higher inter-class distribution overlap leads to lower model multiplicity. This insight is demonstrated through proofs and applied to active learning and data imputation algorithms.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of data on multiplicity, challenging conventional expectations and providing innovative, practical techniques for managing data in machine learning contexts.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

### [238] [Revisiting Social Welfare in Bandits: UCB is (Nearly) All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21312)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Nishant Pandey,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for minimizing Nash regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits using uniform exploration followed by the UCB algorithm, achieving flexibility and near-optimal bounds across fairness metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fairness metrics (particularly Nash social welfare) in multi-armed bandit settings, as conventional regret metrics often fail to address fairness across a population.

Method: The method involves an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard UCB algorithm, relying on additive Hoeffding bounds and accommodating sub-Gaussian reward distributions.

Result: The approach achieves near-optimal Nash regret and can be generalized to $p$-mean regret with nearly optimal bounds across all $p$ values.

Conclusion: This work provides a broadly applicable and less restrictive method for achieving fairness in bandits, outperforming prior methods with fewer assumptions.

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

*Vikas Kanaujia,Vipul Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ScoreNF, a score-based learning method using Normalizing Flow and Independent Metropolis-Hastings for efficient sampling from unnormalized distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling methods like MCMC or machine learning models face challenges in convergence, mode mixing, and reliance on large datasets; thus, there's a need for improved models.

Method: ScoreNF integrates Normalizing Flow architecture with Independent Metropolis-Hastings for unbiased and efficient sampling from unnormalized distributions.

Result: ScoreNF performs effectively even with small training datasets, showing reduced dependency on MCMC data and reliable sampling performance.

Conclusion: ScoreNF is validated on synthetic and high-dimensional datasets, showing promise as an advanced sampling framework for complex distributions.

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

*Sina Molavipour,Alireza M. Javid,Cassie Ye,Björn Löfdahl,Mikhail Nechaev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based framework tailored for robust yield curve estimation in small mortgage bond markets, addressing overfitting and instability issues in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-income markets require accurate yield curve estimation, but traditional methods often struggle in sparse or noisy conditions, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed method uses neural networks with a new loss function focusing on smoothness and stability, providing daily independent yield curve estimates.

Result: Empirical studies on Swedish mortgage bonds show that the approach outperforms traditional methods like NSS and KR in robustness and stability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances yield curve estimation by offering more stability and adaptability to constraints, supporting informed financial decisions in small and noisy markets.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

*Jaesik Yoon,Hyeonseo Cho,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), enhancing trajectory exploration through globally-aware planning and efficient plan composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) in planning longer trajectories due to its local context focus and lack of global reasoning.

Method: The proposed framework, C-MCTD, incorporates three main innovations: Online Composer for globally-aware planning, Distributed Composer for parallel exploration, and Preplan Composer for accelerating inference using cached plan graphs.

Result: C-MCTD empowers more effective trajectory planning by enabling reasoning across complete plan compositions and minimizing search complexity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses local confinement and limited trajectory length issues in MCTD by introducing globally-aware and efficient compositional planning processes.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

*Junda Wang,Minghui Hu,Ning Li,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in class incremental learning (CIL) by presenting a framework with randomized neural networks and forward regularization to reduce forgetting and improve learning efficiency in online task-free scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues of non-i.i.d batch streams, lack of boundary prompts, memory loss during learning long task streams, and cumulative regrets in class incremental learning (CIL).

Method: The paper proposes the randomized neural network with forward regularization (-F) that integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization. It also introduces the ensemble deep random vector functional link network with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), and plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes for self-adaptive Bayesian learning.

Result: The proposed methods outperform canonical approaches in OTCIL settings, resist catastrophic forgetting, avoid past replay, achieve superior learning performance, and enable adaptive parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The OTCIL frameworks (-kF and -kF-Bayes) demonstrate significant efficacy in dynamic performance and compatibility, validated by experiments on 2 image datasets and several metrics, showing their potential for practical applications in continuous learning scenarios.

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-sensitive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) approach using freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO) with a utility function and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of balancing computational cost and performance in hyperparameter optimization by incorporating user preferences into the optimization process.

Method: The authors propose a utility function for cost-performance trade-off, a novel acquisition function, and a stopping criterion to dynamically optimize configurations. They also integrate transfer learning to enhance sample efficiency in freeze-thaw methods.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperformed previous freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines on multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks, achieving a better cost-performance balance.

Conclusion: The approach improves the efficiency and effectiveness of HPO by incorporating cost-sensitive utility, novel optimization techniques, and transfer learning, offering significant advantages for computational resource management.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the integration of black-box and transparent white-box AI assistance into clinical workflows, showing improved accuracy and user acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to determine how clinicians can effectively trust and integrate AI systems into medical workflows for scoring nocturnal arousal events.

Method: Eight sleep medicine practitioners scored events using manual methods, black-box AI assistance, and transparent white-box AI assistance. Assistance was provided at two timings: start-time scoring or post-hoc quality-control review.

Result: Transparent AI assistance applied during QC improved event-level performance by approximately 30% over black-box approaches, though WB and QC methods required more time. Collaboration reduced variability, while start-time assistance saved time and was preferred.

Conclusion: Transparent AI assistance, especially in targeted QC timing, balances accuracy and efficiency, making it a trustworthy and widely acceptable option for integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

*Whie Jung,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed method introduces a modular inductive bias for disentangled representation learning that accommodates diverse factors of variation without altering objectives or architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL methods are limited by fixed assumptions or factor-specific designs, leading to inefficiencies when novel factors of variation emerge.

Method: The paper proposes a mixing strategy based on factor-specific rules that randomizes latent combinations and uses encoder learning paired with a compositional bias to disentangle attributes and objects.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance in disentangling attributes, objects, and their joint disentanglement.

Conclusion: Adjusting the mixing strategy enables flexible and effective disentanglement across various factors without substantial changes to learning objectives or architectural designs.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

### [246] [Large Language Models as Model Organisms for Human Associative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21408)
*Camila Kolling,Vy Ai Vo,Mariya Toneva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exploration of large language models (LLMs) as tools for understanding associative learning, examining representation changes influenced by item similarity and vocabulary interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how internal representations change during associative learning in biological systems is complex, and LLMs offer a scalable alternative for studying such dynamics.

Method: Adapted a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and tested representation evolution across six language models, with specific focus on vocabulary interference.

Result: Non-monotonic representational changes were observed, where moderately similar items differentiated post-learning, and differentiation amplified with higher vocabulary interference.

Conclusion: LLMs can model human-like learning systems effectively, driving insights into memory reorganization in the brain and generating hypotheses on cognitive principles.

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

### [247] [Self-diffusion for Solving Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21417)
*Guanxiong Luo,Shoujin Huang,Yanlong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework, 'self-diffusion', for solving inverse problems without requiring pretrained generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion-based approaches require pretrained models on clean datasets, which limits their flexibility and applicability.

Method: Self-diffusion uses an iterative process involving noising and denoising steps. A randomly initialized convolutional network serves as a self-denoiser, trained on-the-fly using data fidelity loss to refine solutions progressively.

Result: Self-diffusion demonstrated competitive or superior performance in various linear inverse problems, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The self-diffusion framework is adaptive, highly flexible, and broadly applicable, eliminating the dependency on pretrained models while achieving strong performance in solving inverse problems.

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

rewards from an ensemble of world models. DreamerV3-XP is evaluated on a subset
of Atari100k and DeepMind Control Visual Benchmark tasks, confirming the
original DreamerV3 results and showing that our extensions lead to faster
learning and lower dynamics model loss, particularly in sparse-reward settings.

### [249] [A Rapid Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework Based on Extreme Learning Machine for Inverse Stefan Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21426)
*Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Ming-Yue Yang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel physics-informed approach, PIELM, that significantly improves prediction accuracy and reduces training time for solving inverse Stefan problems using extreme learning machine networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the shortcomings of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in addressing inverse Stefan problems, such as dependency on hyperparameters, training inefficiency, and lower prediction accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) framework, utilizing fixed input weights and optimizing output weights through physical laws, transforming the problem into finding the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse with the least squares method.

Result: PIELM improves prediction accuracy by 3-7 orders of magnitude (relative L2 error) and reduces training time by over 94%, compared to traditional PINNs.

Conclusion: PIELM demonstrates superior performance in solving inverse Stefan problems, making it a highly efficient and accurate alternative to traditional PINNs.

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

### [250] [Causality Meets Locality: Provably Generalizable and Scalable Policy Learning for Networked Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21427)
*Hao Liang,Shuqing Shi,Yudi Zhang,Biwei Huang,Yali Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSAC integrates causal representation learning with meta actor-critic methods to enable scalable and generalizable decision-making in complex networked environments such as traffic or power grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenge of scalability and adaptability in large-scale networked systems where environment shifts occur.

Method: The framework uses sparse causal masks for state representation and combines them with meta actor-critic training across multiple domains for scalability and adaptation. A few trajectories suffice for policy adaptation.

Result: GSAC achieves rapid adaptation, strong performance improvements over baseline methods, and theoretical guarantees on causal recovery and policy optimization.

Conclusion: GSAC effectively enables domain generalization and scalable reinforcement learning in networked systems, outperforming existing baseline approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

### [251] [Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448)
*Zhuojing Tian,Yushu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers in RL, despite success, face scalability limits. Unified Token Representation (UTR) reduces complexity and enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based offline RL models face challenges like redundant tokenization and high computational complexity.

Method: Proposed UTR merges return-to-go, state, and action into one token and introduces two variants: UDT and UDC, leveraging different architectures.

Result: UTR achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art RL methods with reduced computation requirements.

Conclusion: UTR improves scalability and generalization in RL models, paving the way for efficient future decision-making models.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

### [252] [ParaRNN: Unlocking Parallel Training of Nonlinear RNNs for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21450)
*Federico Danieli,Pau Rodriguez,Miguel Sarabia,Xavier Suau,Luca Zappella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ParaRNN, a framework enabling highly parallelized training for nonlinear recurrent neural networks, overcoming RNNs' scalability limitations and achieving superior performance at large scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent Neural Networks struggle with scalability due to sequential computation, limiting parallelization and capacity for large-scale modeling.

Method: ParaRNN reformulates nonlinear recurrence relations into a single system of equations, efficiently solved via parallel Newton iterations and custom reductions.

Result: The approach achieves up to 665x speedup, demonstrating effective training of 7B-parameter nonlinear RNNs with comparable results to Transformers and Mamba2 models.

Conclusion: ParaRNN offers a scalable solution for training nonlinear RNNs and releases an open-source framework to encourage exploration of effective sequence modeling paradigms.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

### [253] [Towards Explainable Personalized Recommendations by Learning from Users' Photos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21455)
*Jorge Díez,Pablo Pérez-Núñez,Oscar Luaces,Beatriz Remeseiro,Antonio Bahamonde*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to generate personalized explanations for Recommender Systems (RS) by predicting user-preferred photos, which showcase the qualities of recommended items effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing importance of explanations for RS stems from the need to enhance user trust and system reliability. Photos uploaded by users often reflect their opinions about items, creating an opportunity to provide personalized explanations and insights into user preferences.

Method: The authors propose a formal framework to predict photos that users would take to justify or reinforce their opinions about items using data from TripAdvisor, which includes reviews and associated images.

Result: The proposed method is capable of estimating the authorship probability of user-photo pairs, helping to predict attractive and convincing image content for users.

Conclusion: The model enhances the reliability of RS and provides companies valuable insights into user-highlighted product features, empowering better business decisions.

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

### [254] [Estimating Treatment Effects in Networks using Domain Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21457)
*Daan Caljon,Jente Van Belle,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses estimating treatment effects in networks affected by interference and network-induced covariate shifts using HINet, a method integrating graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is challenging due to interference and network-level covariate shifts caused by homophily and treatment mechanisms.

Method: HINet combines graph neural networks with domain adversarial training to handle unknown exposure mappings and address network-level covariate shifts.

Result: Empirical evaluations using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets showcase the effectiveness of HINet in estimating treatment effects under challenging network conditions.

Conclusion: Integrating graph neural networks with domain adversarial training can successfully estimate treatment effects in networks, even with complex interference and covariate shift scenarios.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

*Chaewoon Bae,Doyun Choi,Jaehyun Lee,Jaemin Yoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZEN is a parameter-free, linear model for few-shot node classification on hypergraphs, outperforming competitive models in both accuracy and speed while remaining interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in few-shot node classification for hypergraphs, such as overfitting, scalability, and the need for capturing high-order structures effectively.

Method: ZEN introduces a parameter-free model with a linearized architecture, employing a closed-form weight matrix solution and a redundancy-aware propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and redundant information.

Result: ZEN achieves superior classification accuracy on 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks and delivers up to 696x faster performance compared to the fastest competitor.

Conclusion: ZEN balances efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, providing a scalable approach to hypergraph-based classification tasks without requiring complex architectures.

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

### [256] [Uniform Convergence Beyond Glivenko-Cantelli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21506)
*Tanmay Devale,Pramith Devulapalli,Steve Hanneke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uniform Mean Estimability ($UME$) to generalize the concept of uniform mean estimation beyond empirical means, focusing on separability conditions of mean vectors and exploring its properties. It solves a conjecture about the learnability of countable unions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the principle of uniform convergence from empirical mean estimation to arbitrary estimators, addressing limitations of prior methods like $P-$Glivenko-Cantelli from Vapnik-Chervonenkis (1971).

Method: The researchers proposed $UME-$ learnability as a generalized framework. They studied the mean vectors of distributions to identify conditions for uniform mean estimation and utilized separability analysis and constructed counterexamples to test necessary conditions.

Result: Separability of mean vectors was found sufficient but not necessary for $UME-$ learnability. Additionally, they solved a conjecture, proving that countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections remain $UME-$ learnable.

Conclusion: This work expands the understanding of conditions for uniform mean estimation, establishes $UME-$ learnability as a broader paradigm, and consolidates theoretical insights about the countable unions of learnable sets.

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

### [257] [A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525)
*Huatian Gong,Jiuh-Biing Sheu,Zheng Wang,Xiaoguang Yang,Ran Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a unified model for drone routing in post-disaster scenarios, addressing multiple task variants efficiently, outperforming existing methods, and proving adaptable in dynamic situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency response requires rapid and efficient road infrastructure assessment after disasters, a task drones can handle but face routing challenges in large networks.

Method: The unified model leverages a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and uses a single neural network trained across multiple problem configurations. It incorporates a lightweight adapter for flexibility and efficient finetuning.

Result: The unified model reduces training time and parameters significantly, outperforms single-task DRL and traditional optimization approaches, and provides real-time solutions while demonstrating robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: This unified model improves computational efficiency, solution quality, and versatility, advancing neural combinatorial optimization in time-sensitive scenarios like drone-based post-disaster road assessments.

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

### [258] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates training techniques using probes to detect and correct undesirable model behaviors, emphasizing probe reliability under Goodhart's Law scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting misbehavior in models, such as bias or deception, via probes and ensuring the reliability of monitors as training targets despite potential distortions due to optimization processes.

Method: The authors propose two training methods (Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization) and evaluate them using a testbed for toxicity reduction. They test strategies including using probe ensembles, retaining unused probes, and retraining probes after optimization.

Result: Probe-based preference optimization retains probe accuracy better than classifiers, and retraining probes after optimization restores detection performance. Probe diversity (ensembles) offers little improvement.

Conclusion: Probes can be reliably used for training in model alignment provided retraining is feasible, and probe ensembles are not essential for maintaining detection reliability.

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

*Mojtaba Nafez,Mobina Poulaei,Nikan Vasei,Bardia Soltani Moakhar,Mohammad Sabokrou,MohammadHossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enhance robustness in Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSVAD models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the lack of reliable frame-level predictions and inadequacy of traditional defense mechanisms.

Method: The method, Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), generates synthetic anomalies via severe localized augmentations in normal videos while maintaining temporal consistency, reducing noise in pseudo-labels for adversarial training.

Result: The proposed method improved robustness against adversarial attacks, achieving an average of 71.0% better AUROC performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The introduced SRD method effectively diminishes label noise and greatly enhances the reliability of WSVAD models, offering significant performance gains. The implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new static metric, Excision Score (ES), for assessing revision similarity, significantly outperforming existing metrics like BLEU and SARI in tasks such as code-editing evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inadequacies in existing pairwise similarity measures (e.g., BLEU) that fail to align with human judgments due to dominance by shared document content.

Method: The study develops Excision Score (ES), leveraging longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove shared context and focus on divergent regions; computational efficiency is enhanced by approximating cubic LCS computation to quadratic.

Result: ES demonstrates higher correlation with human judgment in code-editing evaluations, surpassing SARI by 12% and BLEU by >21%. Its performance improves further when the shared context in data increases.

Conclusion: Excision Score resolves flaws in existing measures and provides a robust metric for document revision similarity, excelling in handling nuanced cases like moved code blocks or selective edits.

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

TL;DR: This paper presents a SAGIN-MEC architecture and proposes the MADDPG-COCG algorithm to tackle decision-making challenges in the low-altitude economy by optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectories, and other parameters. Simulation results show significant improvements in user-centric performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAGIN-MEC aims to address the computing needs of the rapidly developing low-altitude economy, but faces challenges like coordinating diverse nodes, modeling mobility and network variability, and real-time decision-making under complex environments.

Method: The paper presents a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture and formulates a UD cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP). It proposes the MADDPG-COCG algorithm using multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient combined with convex optimization and coalitional game theory to manage hybrid decision-making efficiently.

Result: The proposed MADDPG-COCG algorithm improves user-centric metrics such as UD cost, task completion delay, and energy usage while ensuring scalability, convergence stability, and increasing UAV energy slightly.

Conclusion: This solution effectively enhances SAGIN-MEC system performance in LAE environments. It demonstrates feasibility for real-world applications with improved user-centric outcomes and stable decision-making processes.

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated ECG interpretation systems lack transparency and struggle to generalize to unseen conditions, necessitating a more robust approach for trustworthy diagnostics.

Method: ZETA uses a zero-shot multimodal framework that compares ECG signals with structured clinical observations curated with an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, utilizing a pre-trained multimodal model for ECG and text embeddings.

Result: Empirical evaluations show competitive zero-shot classification performance, and the system demonstrates enhanced interpretability by aligning predictions with clinically relevant diagnostic features.

Conclusion: ZETA represents a promising advancement in ECG diagnostic systems, aligning analysis with clinical knowledge to improve transparency, generalizability, and trustworthiness, and supports future research with released datasets and code.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms for improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to leverage the reliability and correctness of classical algorithms to improve the flexibility and generalization abilities of GNNs, particularly for molecular property prediction tasks.

Method: The study uses GNNs pretrained on 24 classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. These pretrained layers are then used to initialize and freeze parts of another GNN used for molecular property prediction.

Result: The pretrained models demonstrated consistent performance wins over a random initialization baseline, achieving a 6% gain on the ogbg-molhiv task and a 3% gain on the ogbg-molclintox task.

Conclusion: Pretraining GNNs on classical algorithms provides useful inductive biases that significantly enhance performance in challenging, real-world graph tasks.

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

*Diego Doimo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates deep neural networks' learning mechanisms, focusing on representation generation and generalization through unsupervised methods, intrinsic dimension estimation, semantic hierarchy analysis, and generalization properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how deep neural networks internally create meaningful representations and achieve generalization.

Method: The paper develops tools like the Gride method for intrinsic dimension estimation and analyzes probability density evolution and generalization properties in deep neural networks.

Result: Gride efficiently estimates intrinsic dimensionality; probability density evolution mirrors semantic hierarchy; wide regularized networks with zero error learn redundant representations.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks exhibit hierarchical structure in learning representations, enabling better generalization when regularized and with redundant neurons formed under ideal conditions.

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

*Lei Liu,Zhenxin Huang,Hong Wang,huanshuo dong,Haiyang Xin,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the HOmologous Perturbation in Solution Space (HOPSS), an efficient algorithm for generating training datasets for deep learning models solving PDEs, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to traditional numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale computational resources are required for generating solution pairs needed by data-driven deep learning methods for nonlinear temporal PDEs, posing efficiency challenges during dataset preparation.

Method: The paper proposes HOPSS, a novel algorithm combining downsampling of base solutions and homologous perturbation, generating solution pairs more efficiently with reduced time steps while preserving precision.

Result: HOPSS generates comparable-precision PDE datasets approximately 10 times faster than traditional methods, demonstrated using the Navier-Stokes equation.

Conclusion: HOPSS effectively reduces computational time for dataset generation without compromising model training performance, marking a significant advancement in data efficiency for solving PDEs with deep learning.

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

*Reda Marzouk,Shahaf Bassan,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAP computation is analyzed for Tensor Networks (TNs), introducing efficient methods for Tensor Train structures and revealing width as the key complexity factor for certain neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenge of calculating SHAP explanations for complex models, particularly neural networks and Tensor Networks.

Method: Introduced a framework for exact SHAP computation tailored to Tensor Networks, with enhanced efficiency for Tensor Train structures using parallel computation.

Result: Achieved efficient SHAP computation in poly-logarithmic time for Tensor Trains and identified width as the key computational factor for binarized neural networks.

Conclusion: Efficiently tractable SHAP computation can be achieved for models with fixed width, redefining computational bottlenecks in explanation generation for Tensor Networks.

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalised Flow Maps (GFMs), a new few-step generative model framework for geometric data, achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiency in current geometric generative models applied to domains like protein generation and geospatial data.

Method: GFMs extend Flow Map frameworks to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds, using three self-distillation-based training methods: Generalised Lagrangian, Eulerian, and Progressive Flow Maps.

Result: GFMs outperform other models with state-of-the-art sample quality in single- and few-step evaluations, and competitive log-likelihood scores across multiple geometric datasets.

Conclusion: GFMs provide a computationally efficient and theoretically unified approach to high-quality generative modeling on Riemannian manifolds, advancing geometric data applications.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a method preserving the full correlation structure of data for synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods that fail to capture complex correlation structures in synthetic data.

Method: Introduces GCM leveraging Cholesky decomposition of target correlation matrices to ensure preservation of pairwise and higher-order correlations.

Result: Synthetic data generated through GCM retains the essential multi-variable interactions inherent to real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GCM offers a computationally efficient and mathematically proven approach to advance synthetic data generation for applications like privacy and robust modeling.

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the brittleness of reinforcement learning systems when faced with distribution shifts in safety-critical settings.

Method: DEEDEE employs a two-statistic approach using episodewise mean and RBF kernel similarity to capture global and local deviations in RL time series data.

Result: DEEDEE outperforms contemporary OOD detectors in RL tasks, offering a 600x reduction in computational cost and an average 5% improvement in detection accuracy against strong baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that low-order statistics can effectively capture OOD patterns in RL trajectories, suggesting a compact and efficient method for OOD detection in complex settings.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between equivariant networks and model calibration, proving theoretical bounds on calibration errors under equivariance conditions and analyzing symmetry mismatches with numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equivariant networks can enhance modeling across sparse input spaces and guard against overconfidence, yet their effects on model calibration and uncertainty estimation remain unexplored.

Method: The study establishes a theoretical framework with bounds on calibration errors for equivariant networks and supplements it with numerical experiments analyzing symmetry mismatches and uncertainties in diverse datasets.

Result: The paper identifies trends in calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) linked to equivariance, symmetry mismatch, group size, and types of uncertainties.

Conclusion: Equivariance plays a crucial role in uncertainty calibration, and symmetry mismatches can lead to miscalibration in models, impacting their generalization abilities.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide interpretability and insight into the operations of Transformer-based TSP solvers, which currently operate as opaque 'black boxes.'

Method: The authors train a pointer network using reinforcement learning and apply sparse autoencoders to the encoder's residual stream to identify an interpretable feature dictionary.

Result: The analysis discovered features aligned with fundamental TSP concepts, such as convex-hull node detectors, cluster-sensitive features for dense regions, and geometric partitioning separators.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the emergence of geometric structure without supervision in neural models, paving the way for transparent hybrid systems combining neural efficiency and algorithmic interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores the distinct and complementary roles of lateral inhibition (LI) and spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in the fly olfactory circuit, showing their combined role in optimizing odor discrimination under varying noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether lateral inhibition (LI) and spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in the fly olfactory circuit perform redundant or distinct roles in odor pattern separation, especially in complex noisy environments.

Method: A computational model of the fly olfactory circuit was developed to investigate how LI and SFA affect odor discrimination under varying noise levels that simulate real-world complexity.

Result: The study finds that LI enhances odor discrimination in low- to medium-noise conditions but is less effective or detrimental in high-noise scenarios. SFA, however, consistently improves discrimination across all noise levels. Together, LI and SFA optimize discrimination, with each mechanism dominating in specific noise conditions.

Conclusion: This research highlights that multiple modules in biological circuits, seemingly performing overlapping functions, are actually complementary and essential for achieving optimal learning and adaptation in noisy and complex environments.

Abstract: Biological circuits have evolved to incorporate multiple modules that perform
similar functions. In the fly olfactory circuit, both lateral inhibition (LI)
and neuronal spike frequency adaptation (SFA) are thought to enhance pattern
separation for odor learning. However, it remains unclear whether these
mechanisms play redundant or distinct roles in this process. In this study, we
present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor
discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex
environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination
in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse
under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves
discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low-
and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.
When combined, these two sparsification mechanisms enable optimal
discrimination performance. This work demonstrates that seemingly redundant
modules in biological circuits can, in fact, be essential for achieving optimal
learning in complex contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address Spiking Neural Networks' (SNNs) struggle to compete in visual long-sequence modeling tasks due to limitations in establishing a robust global Spatio-Temporal Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF).

Method: The authors introduce the ST-ERF for analyzing ERF distributions in Transformer-based SNNs and propose two channel-mixer architectures—MLPixer and SRB—to improve spatial ERF across time steps.

Result: Experiments on object detection, semantic segmentation, and Meta-SDT variants demonstrate significant performance improvements with the proposed method.

Conclusion: The ST-ERF framework and its architectures improve SNN performance in visual tasks and provide a foundation for optimizing SNN designs further. They hold broad applicability for enhancing visual feature modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing through an event-driven paradigm. While
training methods and computational models have greatly advanced, SNNs struggle
to achieve competitive performance in visual long-sequence modeling tasks. In
artificial neural networks, the effective receptive field (ERF) serves as a
valuable tool for analyzing feature extraction capabilities in visual
long-sequence modeling. Inspired by this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal
Effective Receptive Field (ST-ERF) to analyze the ERF distributions across
various Transformer-based SNNs. Based on the proposed ST-ERF, we reveal that
these models suffer from establishing a robust global ST-ERF, thereby limiting
their visual feature modeling capabilities. To overcome this issue, we propose
two novel channel-mixer architectures:
\underline{m}ulti-\underline{l}ayer-\underline{p}erceptron-based
m\underline{ixer} (MLPixer) and \underline{s}plash-and-\underline{r}econstruct
\underline{b}lock (SRB). These architectures enhance global spatial ERF through
all timesteps in early network stages of Transformer-based SNNs, improving
performance on challenging visual long-sequence modeling tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on the Meta-SDT variants and across object detection and
semantic segmentation tasks further validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. Beyond these specific applications, we believe the proposed ST-ERF
framework can provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing SNN
architectures across a broader range of tasks. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in using LLMs for RTL code generation, specifically functional correctness and PPA optimization.

Method: Develop REvolution, a dual-population EC framework that dynamically adjusts prompt strategies, integrates feedback, and evolves candidates for RTL design.

Result: REvolution enhanced LLM initial pass rates by up to 24.0% and achieved a 95.5% final pass rate with DeepSeek-V3, along with improved PPA performance of generated RTL designs.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with EC enables global optimization for RTL code generation, overcoming local search limitations and achieving significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code
generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and
Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based
methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search,
hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution,
a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic
RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates
in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and
evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that
divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA
optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search
efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt
strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and
RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of
various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a
final pass rate of 95.5\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the
need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the
generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference
designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs'
generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the
local-search limitations of previous methods.

### [275] [Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Optimal User Order Routing: Multi-Objective Solver Optimization in CoW Protocol Batch Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21647)
*Mitchell Marfinetz*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm for optimizing blockchain routing by employing multi-objective evolutionary methods, enhancing user surplus and ensuring real-time safety under auction deadlines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve inefficiencies in traditional single-objective heuristics used in decentralized exchange (DEX) auctions that fail to manage complexities such as split-flow opportunities and constraints like gas, slippage, and execution risks.

Method: A hybrid genetic algorithm is introduced, combining a multi-objective NSGA-II engine, adaptive instance profiling, and deterministic baselines. The system emphasizes Pareto optimization for multiple objectives such as maximizing user surplus and minimizing costs.

Result: The hybrid approach demonstrated user-surplus gains between 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders and showed rapid convergence within 0.5 seconds (median) within a strict 2-second deadline.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the advantages of applying multi-objective genetic algorithms in blockchain routing problems, ensuring correct and safe execution while achieving better outcomes for users under stringent conditions.

Abstract: CoW Protocol batch auctions aggregate user intents and rely on solvers to
find optimal execution paths that maximize user surplus across heterogeneous
automated market makers (AMMs) under stringent auction deadlines. Deterministic
single-objective heuristics that optimize only expected output frequently fail
to exploit split-flow opportunities across multiple parallel paths and to
internalize gas, slippage, and execution risk constraints in a unified search.
We apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization to this blockchain routing
problem, proposing a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) architecture for real-time
solver optimization that combines a production-grade, multi-objective NSGA-II
engine with adaptive instance profiling and deterministic baselines. Our core
engine encodes variable-length path sets with continuous split ratios and
evolves candidate route-and-volume allocations under a Pareto objective vector
F = (user surplus, -gas, -slippage, -risk), enabling principled trade-offs and
anytime operation within the auction deadline. An adaptive controller selects
between GA and a deterministic dual-decomposition optimizer with Bellman-Ford
based negative-cycle detection, with a guarantee to never underperform the
baseline. The open-source system integrates six protection layers and passes
8/8 tests, validating safety and correctness. In a 14-stratum benchmark (30
seeds each), the hybrid approach yields absolute user-surplus gains of
approximately 0.40-9.82 ETH on small-to-medium orders, while large
high-fragmentation orders are unprofitable across gas regimes. Convergence
occurs in about 0.5 s median (soft capped at 1.0 s) within a 2-second limit. We
are not aware of an openly documented multi-objective GA with end-to-end safety
for real-time DEX routing.

### [276] [xMem: A CPU-Based Approach for Accurate Estimation of GPU Memory in Deep Learning Training Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21048)
*Jiabo Shi,Dimitrios Pezaros,Yehia Elkhatib*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces xMem, a framework for CPU-only dynamic analysis that estimates peak GPU memory needs with high precision, addressing GPU scarcity and enabling efficient resource sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The global GPU shortage necessitates efficient memory estimation for better scheduling in deep learning tasks, avoiding OOM errors and resource underutilization.

Method: xMem leverages CPU-based dynamic analysis without GPU usage or intrusive code changes to provide accurate estimations of GPU memory needs.

Result: xMem decreases median relative error by 91%, reduces estimation failure probability by 75%, and achieves a 368% improvement in memory conservation potential compared to current solutions.

Conclusion: xMem provides an innovative and efficient solution to GPU memory estimation challenges, supporting enhanced resource utilization in shared environments.

Abstract: The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for
Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how
much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced
scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and
resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have
limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with
machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics.
Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques
require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely
estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances,
without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this
challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic
analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We
conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions
using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs,
which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it
decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the
probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that
the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately,
these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential
over current solutions.

*Pranamya Kulkarni,Puranjay Datta,Burak Varıcı,Emre Acartürk,Karthikeyan Shanmugam,Ali Tajer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROPES, an unsupervised causal representation learning (CRL) framework for robotic pose estimation, which effectively disentangles latent generative factors without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to close the gap between theoretical advances and real-world applications of causal representation learning (CRL) by applying it to robotics. Robot pose estimation serves as a practical testbed for CRL.

Method: The method involves introducing Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES), which disentangles controllable latent variables through interventions by leveraging natural variations in robotic actuators and relying solely on distributional changes.

Result: Empirical evaluations in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES effectively disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity compared to ground truth, without using labeled data.

Conclusion: The paper positions robot pose estimation as a promising near-practical testbed for causal representation learning, contributing to bridging the theory-practice gap in this domain.

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

TL;DR: SutureBot introduces an autonomous robotic suturing benchmark utilizing the da Vinci Research Kit, offering datasets and evaluation tools for improved robotic surgical precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating a fully autonomous robotic system for suturing to advance robotic autonomy in surgery, which poses significant challenges in dexterous long-horizon tasks.

Method: Developed SutureBot with goal-conditioned frameworks to improve insertion-point precision, introduced a dataset with 1,890 demonstrations, and benchmarked modern vision-language-action models.

Result: Goal-conditioned frameworks showcased 59%-74% improvement in targeting accuracy compared to task-only baselines. The dataset facilitates reproducible evaluations.

Conclusion: SutureBot serves as a significant step towards developing precision-focused manipulation policies necessary for fully autonomous robotic surgery, validated through reproducible benchmarks.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,
requiring coordinated needle grasping, precise tissue penetration, and secure
knot tying. Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully
autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware.
We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying.
To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890
suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework
that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a
benchmark for dexterous imitation learning, we evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language-action (VLA) models, including $\pi_0$, GR00T N1, OpenVLA-OFT,
and multitask ACT, each augmented with a high-level task-prediction policy.
Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in
surgery. These contributions support reproducible evaluation and development of

TL;DR: This paper introduces PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a framework to improve robustness in Point Cloud Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) against camera pose mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in RL methods relying on visual input, such as brittleness to lighting, color, and viewpoints, and sensitivity in PC-RL to mismatched camera poses.

Method: Developed PPC, which canonicalizes point clouds using rigid-body transformations into a consistent canonical frame, eliminating viewpoint inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in handling unseen camera poses across robotic tasks compared to domain randomization techniques.

Conclusion: PPC provides an effective and principled solution enhancing robustness in PC-RL settings for robotic control.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a system where robots learn object manipulation tasks by watching human demonstration videos and replicating them in varied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to learn manipulation tasks effectively from human demonstrations, addressing challenges of transferring trajectories and adapting to different environments.

Method: A system with four modules: data collection via AR headset, video understanding for extracting 3D trajectories, trajectory transfer from human to robot, and trajectory optimization for robot configuration space.

Result: Experiments show the system's effectiveness, where the robot successfully repeats mobile manipulation tasks demonstrated by humans, despite environmental changes.

Conclusion: The system allows robots to learn tasks from human demonstration videos and replicate them flexibly in changing environments.

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

*Zlatan Ajanović,Ravi Prakash,Leandro de Souza Rosa,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates teaching robots long-horizon tasks through two approaches, traditional monolithic and sequential $(ST)^2$, finding user preferences split between control and simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching robots long-horizon tasks effectively is challenging due to accumulated errors, distributional shift, and human fatigue during demonstrations.

Method: A study was conducted comparing monolithic and sequential $(ST)^2 teaching frameworks in a retail-based task with user-defined segmentations and structured demonstrations.

Result: Results indicated that both methods yielded similar task success rates and trajectory quality, with user preferences divided between iterative control benefits and simplicity.

Conclusion: Both teaching methods have strengths, and user preferences depend on control flexibility versus simplicity in demonstration.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

*Mitchell E. C. Sabbadini,Andrew H. Liu,Joseph Ruan,Tyler S. Wilson,Zachary Kingston,Jonathan D. Gammell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal planning algorithms for reactive replanning, avoiding the need to update existing plans by treating the problem as independent planning queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges in reactive replanning for robots operating in dynamic environments, such as computational costs and complexities in updating planning graphs when obstacles change.

Method: The authors introduce a new approach using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning algorithms like EIT* and AORRTC that solve incremental problems independently instead of updating existing plans.

Result: Simulated experiments showed that EIT* outperformed other reactive planning methods with shorter median solution paths. Similarly, AORRTC was validated in a real-world robotic arm task.

Conclusion: Fast ASAO planning algorithms provide an efficient solution for reactive replanning, eliminating the need for explicit plan reuse and adapting effectively to changing environments.

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a framework for hierarchical policy learning that enhances generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation using object-centric skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and generalizable policy learning in robotic manipulation tasks, especially in unseen scenarios and spatial setups.

Method: GSL uses object-centric skills as an interface between high-level vision-language models and low-level visual-motor policies. Demonstrations are decomposed into transferable skill primitives using foundation models, ensuring flexible and efficient canonicalized skill learning.

Result: GSL demonstrates substantial improvements in sample efficiency and generalization, outperforming baselines in simulation and real-world experiments, even when provided significantly fewer demonstrations.

Conclusion: The structured design of GSL bridges high- and low-level policy learning effectively, significantly improving efficiency and task generalization in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

TL;DR: The study presents a new controller for modular robots, ensuring adaptive velocity control for lunar missions under real-world disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address reconfigurability and fault tolerance challenges in modular robots, targeting harsh environments like lunar missions.

Method: The method entails developing a controller with adaptive velocity bounds using dynamic hypersphere clamps, tested on two MoonBot limbs in a lunar simulator.

Result: Field trials showed the step-based variant provided low-wobble motions and predictability, while the continuous version ensured faster convergence and precision despite mechanical imperfections.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates a robust, hardware-agnostic framework suitable for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration in harsh conditions.

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of visual degradation and feature scarcity in underwater environments that hinder SLAM systems.

Method: A graph-based visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system is proposed, integrating stereo cameras, IMU, DVL, and a pressure sensor. Novel strategies for DVL preintegration and hybrid techniques for tracking and optimization are employed.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed system surpasses state-of-the-art solutions in stability and localization accuracy, especially in visually demanding underwater scenarios.

Conclusion: The integration of multimodal sensors enables a highly robust SLAM system capable of accurate localization under challenging underwater conditions.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

Motivation: First responders widely adopt consumer-grade UAVs but currently rely on manual operation requiring trained pilots, which is challenging in GNSS-denied environments or near structures. Autonomous systems can alleviate these challenges but are hindered by specialized hardware and software requirements.

Method: The system uses lightweight consumer-grade DJI drones, controlled via an Android app for state estimation and obstacle avoidance. A ground control station supervises multiple UAVs, consolidating their observations into a shared 3D environment model.

Result: The system enables autonomous flight using consumer-grade drones with simpler hardware/software setups, allowing a single operator to manage multiple UAVs effectively and generate a combined 3D situational awareness model.

Conclusion: The proposed system simplifies UAV deployment for first responders, enhancing efficient management of multiple drones and improving their operational functionality in challenging environments.

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of quadruped robots navigating unstable surfaces in activities like search and rescue or planetary exploration.

Method: The framework incorporates terrain probing, load analysis, motion planning, and control strategies via an MPC system and state machine. Stability is assessed using joint measurements, avoiding external sensor reliance.

Result: Experimental tests on collapsing and rocky platforms confirm the framework's effectiveness in detecting unstable terrains and maintaining stability.

Conclusion: This approach enables quadruped robots to traverse dangerous terrains by efficiently using joint data and dynamically adapting their footholds, prioritizing safety.

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

*Satheeshkumar Veeramani,Zhengxue Zhou,Francisco Munguia-Galeano,Hatem Fakhruldeen,Thomas Roddelkopf,Mohammed Faeik Ruzaij Al-Okby,Kerstin Thurow,Andrew Ian Cooper*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces PREVENT, a system to enhance workflow awareness in mobile robotic chemists using multimodal perception to avoid false positives and negatives in anomaly detection during chemistry workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of workflow awareness in mobile robotic chemists, which can lead to inefficiencies, wasted resources, and risks to human researchers caused by anomalies like improperly capped vials.

Method: The authors propose PREVENT, which leverages a multimodal Behavior Tree (BT) approach combined with hierarchical perception using AI techniques, cameras, and IoT sensors for anomaly detection and workflow execution.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that PREVENT fully avoids false positives and negatives in anomalies, achieving higher deployment accuracy in navigation and manipulation compared to uni-modal approaches.

Conclusion: PREVENT is an efficient and accurate system for improving workflow awareness and safety in mobile robotic chemists, reducing human intervention and enhancing operational autonomy.

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and
for manipulation.

*Domenico Palmisano,Giuseppe Palestra,Berardina Nadja De Carolis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper highlights resilience as a key aspect of social robots, emphasizing its role in ensuring trust while operating in sensitive, often stressful, contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for resilient and trustworthy AI systems, especially in sensitive sectors like healthcare and among vulnerable populations such as the elderly.

Method: The paper emphasizes the design of social robots capable of maintaining functionality under adverse or stressful conditions.

Result: Integration of resilience into social robots enhances their ability to gain trust, particularly among elderly users who may have low confidence in such systems.

Conclusion: Resilience is essential for social robots to operate effectively in sensitive contexts and maintain trust, especially when working with populations that are inherently skeptical or resistant towards AI.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

### [291] [AURASeg: Attention Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement for Drivable-Area Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21536)
*Narendhiran Vijayakumar,Sridevi. M*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces AURASeg, a segmentation model designed for accurate ground segmentation in robots and autonomous vehicles. It achieves higher accuracy and better edge precision compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ground segmentation models struggle with fine-grained features, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited feature representation, especially in indoor and structured environments.

Method: The paper proposes AURASeg, a model using CSP-Darknet backbone with Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) and Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder (APUD). Additionally, it integrates a lightweight Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) for multi-scale context extraction.

Result: AURASeg outperforms state-of-the-art models with +1.26% improvement in mIoU and +1.65% in segmentation precision on tested datasets, showcasing its ability for robust indoor and outdoor perception.

Conclusion: AURASeg enables precise ground segmentation with improved edge refinement while maintaining real-time performance, making it ideal for autonomous navigation in structured environments.

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to transform egocentric human videos into robotic Vision-Language-Action data, creating a large-scale training dataset that improves robotic manipulation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in robotic Vision-Language-Action models by utilizing readily available human hand video data for scalable pretraining.

Method: A fully-automated human activity analysis approach processes egocentric videos to create task-segmented data with language descriptions and motion information.

Result: A dataset of 1M episodes and 26M frames is built, enabling a pre-trained model exhibiting strong zero-shot capabilities and improved performance after fine-tuning on real robot data.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for scalable VLA pretraining, enhancing generalization and task performance in robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

*Elle Miller,Trevor McInroe,David Abel,Oisin Mac Aodha,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops self-supervised learning methods to enhance tactile sensing in reinforcement learning, enabling highly dexterous robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe, reliable robotic manipulation requires tactile sensing to address sensory deficits and improve performance beyond relying on vision or ideal state information.

Method: The approach combines proprioception and sparse binary tactile sensing, utilizing self-supervised learning methodologies to process tactile data effectively.

Result: Empirical results show that sparse tactile signals are crucial for dexterity in tasks where robot-object interactions involve complex motion. Robots achieved superhuman performance in ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation tasks.

Conclusion: Tactile sensing is essential for dexterous robotics, and decoupling SSL memory from on-policy memory enhances performance. The authors provide the RoTO benchmark to standardize tactile-based manipulation research.

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight, modular drone designed for search and rescue missions with enhanced structural durability and adaptive navigation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro aerial vehicles are vital for search and rescue missions but face durability and dynamic navigation issues in rough terrains.

Method: Designing a durable, low-cost drone reinforced with lightweight materials and powered by open-source software for adaptive navigation.

Result: The proposed drone achieves real-time perception, adaptive path planning, and robustness without relying on expensive hardware.

Conclusion: A practical, affordable solution for search and rescue operations utilizing widely available materials and technologies.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.

TL;DR: GreenMalloc improves memory allocator configuration using NSGA-II and benchmarking, showing reduced heap usage without sacrificing runtime efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency in memory allocation and the need to optimize allocator parameters for better performance and memory usage in diverse workloads.

Method: Utilizes NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization and rand_malloc for benchmarking allocator configurations, transferring results to gem5 system simulator.

Result: Achieves up to 4.1% reduction in average heap usage and 0.25% reduction in runtime efficiency across various workloads.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates enhanced memory allocator configurations with improved memory efficiency, maintaining runtime performance.

Abstract: We present GreenMalloc, a multi objective search-based framework for
automatically configuring memory allocators. Our approach uses NSGA II and
rand_malloc as a lightweight proxy benchmarking tool. We efficiently explore
allocator parameters from execution traces and transfer the best configurations
to gem5, a large system simulator, in a case study on two allocators: the GNU
C/CPP compiler's glibc malloc and Google's TCMalloc. Across diverse workloads,
our empirical results show up to 4.1 percantage reduction in average heap usage
without loss of runtime efficiency; indeed, we get a 0.25 percantage reduction.

*Qinghua Lu,Dehai Zhao,Yue Liu,Hao Zhang,Liming Zhu,Xiwei Xu,Angela Shi,Tristan Tan,Rick Kazman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgentArcEval, a novel method to evaluate the architecture of agents based on foundation models (FMs), addressing their unique characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods for agent architecture fail due to agents' non-deterministic behaviors, compound architectures, and continuous evolution.

Method: The paper proposes AgentArcEval, an evaluation technique tailored for FM-based agents, alongside a catalogue of generalized scenarios for designing and testing agent architectures.

Result: The method and catalogue were validated through a case study involving a real-world tax copilot named Luna, demonstrating their practical applicability.

Conclusion: AgentArcEval provides a specialized framework for evaluating FM-based agent architectures, enhancing architectural decision-making and application quality.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of
highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities
across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is
particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the
quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including
compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and
continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in
addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique
characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present
AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially
to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.
Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which
serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the
agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the
catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world
tax copilot, named Luna.

### [297] [BDiff: Block-aware and Accurate Text-based Code Differencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21094)
*Yao Lu,Wanwei Liu,Tanghaoran Zhang,Kang Yang,Yang Zhang,Wenyu Xu,Longfei Sun,Xinjun Mao,Shuzheng Gao,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code differencing tools, while vital, struggle with identifying block-level edit actions (EAs) effectively. BDiff, a new algorithm, improves this capability by optimizing edit scripts and surpasses existing tools, including LLMs, in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code differencing methods fail to adequately address edit actions across multiple lines or blocks, hindering developers' efficiency in understanding changes.

Method: BDiff employs a text-based differencing algorithm, using the Kuhn-Munkres method to compute optimal mappings and minimize edit script size, capturing both block-level and line-level edit actions.

Result: BDiff demonstrated superior differencing results, better quality in edit scripts, and competitive runtime performance compared to five baseline tools, including LLMs.

Conclusion: BDiff enhances code differencing by effectively recognizing block-level and line-level edit actions, highlighting existing tools' limitations, including LLMs. It integrates into a web-based visual system.

Abstract: Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice
and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing
techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing
methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that
operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in
developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or
duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent
such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling
developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the
efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a
text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of
block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional
differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all
possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres
algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size
of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's
intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five
state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines
and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their
performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental
results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than
baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our
experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks
regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime
efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.

*Zhen Yang,Hongyi Lin,Xiao Yu,Jacky Wai Keung,Shuo Liu,Pak Yuen Patrick Chan,Yicheng Sun,Fengji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: R2ComSync is proposed to improve code-comment synchronization (CCS) using retrieval-enhanced in-context learning and multi-turn re-ranking strategies, outperforming previous methods and providing higher-quality synchronized comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CCS solutions either lack generalization ability or require extensive task-specific learning resources, leading to an investigation of LLMs' potential in CCS.

Method: R2ComSync uses hybrid retrieval to consider code-comment semantics and change patterns for effective ICL prompts. It also employs a multi-turn re-ranking strategy based on derived rules to prioritize better candidates.

Result: R2ComSync achieves superior performance compared to five SOTA approaches across five LLMs and three datasets in Java and Python, with synchronized comments showing significantly higher quality.

Conclusion: R2ComSync demonstrates the potential of LLMs for improved CCS, overcoming limitations of previous methods through innovative retrieval and re-ranking techniques.

Abstract: Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code
changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of
developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies
have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit
limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive
task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot
analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches
because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)
and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above
challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization
approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync
carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally
considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns
when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)
Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through
large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it
progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively
correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three
CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make
comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both
quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the
comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores AI configuration files for coding assistants across 466 open-source projects, examining adoption, context delivery, and file evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the adoption and usage of AI configuration files (e.g., AGENTS.md) to improve AI coding agents' autonomy and alignment with project-specific guidelines.

Method: A preliminary analysis of 466 open-source projects is conducted to examine how AI configuration files are structured, used, and maintained.

Result: Findings show a lack of structure standardization, varied ways of contextual information provision, and insights into the continuous evolution of AGENTS.md files.

Conclusion: The study highlights opportunities for enhancing AI configuration files to improve prompt engineering and context delivery based on real-world usage and modifications.

Abstract: GenAI-based coding assistants have disrupted software development. Their next
generation is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without
human oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context
about the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require
contextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target
architecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,
and other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development
(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled
Markdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and
testing, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to
each prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates
tool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how
developers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results
of a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in
466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these
files, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our
findings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is
a lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,
prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in
studying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect
the quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that
have modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects
continuously extend and maintain these files. We conclude the paper by
outlining how the adoption of AI configuration files in provides a unique
opportunity to study real-world prompt and context engineering.

TL;DR: The study compares small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) on requirement classification tasks and finds SLMs perform nearly as well, with benefits in efficiency and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of small language models (SLMs) as an alternative to large language models (LLMs) in requirements engineering tasks, addressing concerns around efficiency and data privacy.

Method: Compared eight language models (three LLMs, five SLMs) on requirements classification tasks across three datasets: PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq.

Result: SLMs demonstrated comparable performance to LLMs, achieving almost the same results in F1 scores and even outperforming LLMs in recall on specific datasets despite their significantly smaller size.

Conclusion: SLMs are a valid alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, providing benefits in privacy, cost, and local deployability without a significant trade-off in accuracy.

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

*Yinglong Zou,Juan Zhai,Chunrong Fang,An Guo,Jiawei Liu,Zhenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Scalpel is a testing method designed for automotive DL frameworks in autonomous driving, addressing challenges like stringent processing requirements and memory-related quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to detect critical quality issues in automotive DL frameworks due to incapability in model generation and deployment handling the complexity of multi-input/output, multi-modal data, and multi-level features required by autonomous driving.

Method: Scalpel constructs test input models at a component level by assembling model parts (e.g., heads, necks, backbones). It maintains a model component repository that evolves through selection, mutation, and deployment testing.

Result: Scalpel successfully generates models that enable testing of automotive DL frameworks, detecting quality issues derived from deployment environments.

Conclusion: Scalpel closes the gap in testing for automotive DL frameworks by addressing their unique challenges with specialized model generation at the component level, ensuring reliable deployment in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) plays a key role in autonomous driving systems. DL models
support perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and
sensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs
to understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving
systems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited
computational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these
challenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to
optimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique
quality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as
crashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.
Unfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these
quality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as
these models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor
processing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature
extraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which
existing testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates
test input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by
assembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities
required by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and
updates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,
mutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to
enrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the
autonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential
testing.

*Thomas Welsh,Kristófer Finnsson,Brynjólfur Stefánsson,Helmut Neukirchen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using socio-technical models for adaptive threat detection in software supply chains, emphasizing the interplay of social and technical dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of software supply chain attacks, current threat detection methods fail to address the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of these environments, particularly missing the socio-technical aspects.

Method: The approach outlined involves leveraging socio-technical models to monitor and analyze both technical and social data for dynamic threat detection, supported by case studies like the XZ Utils attack.

Result: The use of socio-technical analysis can help detect suspicious trends and behaviors within software supply chains, informing more targeted vulnerability assessments.

Conclusion: Socio-technical models offer promising opportunities for enhancing adaptive threat detection in SSCs and should be further explored with appropriate research and testing frameworks.

Abstract: Software supply chains (SSCs) are complex systems composed of dynamic,
heterogeneous technical and social components which collectively achieve the
production and maintenance of software artefacts. Attacks on SSCs are
increasing, yet pervasive vulnerability analysis is challenging due to their
complexity. Therefore, threat detection must be targeted, to account for the
large and dynamic structure, and adaptive, to account for its change and
diversity. While current work focuses on technical approaches for monitoring
supply chain dependencies and establishing component controls, approaches which
inform threat detection through understanding the socio-technical dynamics are
lacking. We outline a position and research vision to develop and investigate
the use of socio-technical models to support adaptive threat detection of SSCs.
We motivate this approach through an analysis of the XZ Utils attack whereby
malicious actors undermined the maintainers' trust via the project's GitHub and
mailing lists. We highlight that monitoring technical and social data can
identify trends which indicate suspicious behaviour to then inform targeted and
intensive vulnerability assessment. We identify challenges and research
directions to achieve this vision considering techniques for developer and
software analysis, decentralised adaptation and the need for a test bed for
software supply chain security research.

Method: The researchers utilized NIST's risk management process to analyze 26 benchmarks, identified 57 failure modes, proposed 196 mitigations, and scored benchmarks using BenchRisk across five dimensions.

Result: All analyzed benchmarks showed significant risks in dimensions like comprehensiveness, intelligibility, consistency, correctness, and longevity. BenchRisk provides comparative evaluations and highlights areas needing attention.

Conclusion: BenchRisk is a valuable tool for assessing benchmark reliability and reducing risks. However, findings indicate that LLM benchmarking requires further improvement to ensure accurate and safe decision-making.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) benchmarks inform LLM use decisions (e.g., "is
this LLM safe to deploy for my use case and context?"). However, benchmarks may
be rendered unreliable by various failure modes that impact benchmark bias,
variance, coverage, or people's capacity to understand benchmark evidence.
Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management
process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular
benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding
mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or
severity, providing a frame for evaluating "benchmark risk," which is scored to
provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that
benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion
about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or
more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility,
consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open
research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking. The BenchRisk workflow
allows for comparison between benchmarks; as an open-source tool, it also
facilitates the identification and sharing of risks and their mitigations.

### [304] [Wisdom and Delusion of LLM Ensembles for Code Generation and Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21513)
*Fernando Vallecillos Ruiz,Max Hort,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the complementarity of different coding LLMs and demonstrates that ensemble models can significantly outperform single models if diversity-based strategies are used for output selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reliance on single-model systems for software engineering tasks neglects the complementary potential of multiple LLMs, leaving practitioners with resource-intensive options and unclear strategies for ensemble utilization.

Method: The study empirically compares ten LLMs across three benchmarks and evaluates ensembles formed using these models alongside different solution selection heuristics.

Result: Ensembles show a theoretical performance boost of up to 83% over the best single model. Diversity-based selection strategies achieve 95% of this potential, surpassing consensus-based methods and proving effective even with small ensembles.

Conclusion: Leveraging diverse ensembles of LLMs provides a resource-efficient and effective way to overcome single-model limitations and improve performance on software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

*Marvin Böcker,Ralph Biggins,Michael Schmeing*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated system for satellite ground segments, first applied in the German Heinrich Hertz mission, facilitating use beyond office hours through automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a sustainable, efficient, and automated ground segment for satellite operations, particularly for scenarios with minimal staffing outside office hours.

Method: The approach includes automation in tracking, telemetry, and commanding, pre-planned schedules, real-time monitoring, emergency protocols, and a self-service user portal.

Result: The Heinrich Hertz mission provides fully automated functionalities for handling satellite operations, user access for experiments, and responsive scheduling capabilities.

Conclusion: The automated ground segment concept proved effective and promotes efficient, flexible satellite operations, enhancing accessibility and reducing dependency on human intervention.

Abstract: We present our approach for a periodically unstaffed, fully automated ground
segment. The concept is in use for the first time on the German satellite
communications mission Heinrich Hertz on behalf of the German Space Agency at
DLR. Heinrich Hertz was launched in July 2023 and offers access to scientific
and technical experiments to its users. The mission utilizes major automation
concepts for the satellite platform operations, allowing fully automated
operations outside of office hours. The concept includes tracking, telemetry
and commanding (TTC) of the satellite. Pre-planned and automatically executed
schedules enable commanding without human interaction. The user mission
schedule is planned separately from the main mission schedule and is
automatically de-conflicted. The automatic monitoring concept monitors the
systems of the satellite and all assets in the ground segment and triggers
reactions in operator-configurable ways depending on the mission needs, for
example emergency notifications or automated execution of flight operation
procedures. Additionally, the concept also puts special emphasis on a
self-service user portal that provides flexible access 24/7, even when the
control center is not staffed. The portal allows external users of the payload
to schedule pre-defined experiments, monitor the live execution of the
experiment with browser-based displays and access ground station telemetry and
dedicated RF test equipment during the time of their scheduled experiment.
Tasks can be planned long in advance as well as with a short reaction time
(less than 1 minute), which allows, for example, the reconfiguration of the
payload during a running experiment.

*Oleksandr Kosenkov,Ehsan Zabardast,Davide Fucci,Daniel Mendez,Michael Unterkalmsteiner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap between consistent requirements, system specifications, and GDPR mandates by proposing a new approach for achieving privacy-by-design (PbD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the lack of understanding in practitioner perspectives regarding privacy-by-design objectives, as well as addressing the complex intersection between the GDPR's problem and solution space.

Method: The approach involves reviewing existing studies, conducting practitioner interviews to assess state-of-practice and underlying objectives, and developing and evaluating a GDPR-compliant requirements and system specification methodology.

Result: The study demonstrates how modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts addresses key specification objectives, such as legal knowledge capture, transparency, and traceability.

Conclusion: Compliance with GDPR for PbD requires addressing its mandates across all engineering lifecycle abstraction levels. The proposed approach has shown potential for practical implementation, but further refinement is needed for effective operationalization in the future.

Abstract: Context: Consistent requirements and system specifications are essential for
the compliance of software systems towards the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Both artefacts need to be grounded in the original text and
conjointly assure the achievement of privacy by design (PbD). Objectives: There
is little understanding of the perspectives of practitioners on specification
objectives and goals to address PbD. Existing approaches do not account for the
complex intersection between problem and solution space expressed in GDPR. In
this study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system
specification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:
We reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with
practitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the
underlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We
developed and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification
for PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives. Results: The
relationship between problem and solution space, as expressed in GDPR, is
instrumental in supporting PbD. We demonstrate how our approach, based on the
modeling GDPR content with original legal concepts, contributes to
specification objectives of capturing legal knowledge, supporting specification
transparency, and traceability. Conclusion: GDPR demands need to be addressed
throughout different levels of abstraction in the engineering lifecycle to
achieve PbD. Legal knowledge specified in the GDPR text should be captured in
specifications to address the demands of different stakeholders and ensure
compliance. While our results confirm the suitability of our approach to
address practical needs, we also revealed specific needs for the future
effective operationalization of the approach.

### [307] [BACE: Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation for Interpretable Graphs of Neural Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20831)
*Mehrnaz Asadi,Sina Javadzadeh,Rahil Soroushmojdehi,S. Alireza Seyyed Mousavi,Terence D. Sanger*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BACE, a tool to learn phase-specific brain connectivity from intracranial data, addressing behavior coordination via predictive modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain region coordination during behavior requires models that are both predictive and interpretable.

Method: BACE is an end-to-end framework employing a learnable adjacency matrix, temporal encoders, and intracranial LFPs, validated on synthetic and human data.

Result: BACE accurately recovers connectivity in synthetic data and reveals dynamic subcortical interactions during human tasks.

Conclusion: BACE provides interpretable connectivity and helps generate hypotheses about brain dynamics during behavior phases.

Abstract: Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior
requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce
Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that
learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from
multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many
micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders,
applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained
on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known
graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while
achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.
Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions
during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for
each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific
graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and
provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network
organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to
explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating
data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions
during behavior.

*Dezhi Luo,Qingying Gao,Hokin Deng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores the importance of fine-grained perceptual content for spatial world models in AI, proposing structured perceptual architectures for enhanced spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve AI's ability to model spatial reasoning by revisiting the concepts of simulation and rendering, drawing on human cognition and evidence from aphantasia.

Method: The authors combine neural research into visual awareness with embodied AI insights to propose shared representational geometries for spatial simulations.

Result: Rich perceptual details have been demonstrated to improve physics-based interactions in AI, underscoring the value of structured perceptual representations.

Conclusion: Developing computational architectures that maintain structured perceptual representations is vital for advancing spatial world modeling in AI systems.

Abstract: Spatial world models, representations that support flexible reasoning about
spatial relations, are central to developing computational models that could
operate in the physical world, but their precise mechanistic underpinnings are
nuanced by the borrowing of underspecified or misguided accounts of human
cognition. This paper revisits the simulation versus rendering dichotomy and
draws on evidence from aphantasia to argue that fine-grained perceptual content
is critical for model-based spatial reasoning. Drawing on recent research into
the neural basis of visual awareness, we propose that spatial simulation and
perceptual experience depend on shared representational geometries captured by
higher-order indices of perceptual relations. We argue that recent developments
in embodied AI support this claim, where rich perceptual details improve
performance on physics-based world engagements. To this end, we call for the
development of architectures capable of maintaining structured perceptual
representations as a step toward spatial world modelling in AI.

*Warisa Sritriratanarak,Paulo Garcia*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper presents a computational model for consciousness, asserting it is a physical process linked to its substrate and showing artificial intelligence can exist at high levels without consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to describe and model consciousness computationally amidst the physicalism vs. natural dualism debate, addressing its relevance to artificial intelligence.

Method: The authors developed a computational model of consciousness by incorporating biological or digital substrates and accounting for reactive behaviors in sub-systems.

Result: The findings confirm the physicalism hypothesis that consciousness is linked to its substrate, is an evolutionary advantage, and is distinct from intelligence or other capabilities.

Conclusion: Consciousness can be computationally realized, yet artificial intelligence does not require consciousness, and imbuing AI with it offers no advantage.

Abstract: Precisely defining consciousness and identifying the mechanisms that effect
it is a long-standing question, particularly relevant with advances in
artificial intelligence. The scientific community is divided between
physicalism and natural dualism. Physicalism posits consciousness is a physical
process that can be modeled computationally; natural dualism rejects this
hypothesis. Finding a computational model has proven elusive, particularly
because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities
exhibited by humans, such as intelligence and physiological sensations. Here we
show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness, natural or
artificial, identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect
it, confirming the physicalism hypothesis. We found such a model is obtainable
when including the underlying (biological or digital) substrate and accounting
for reactive behavior in substrate sub-systems (e.g., autonomous physiological
responses). Results show that, unlike all other computational processes,
consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an
evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities. Our result shows there is no
impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but,
surprisingly, that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of
arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever, and that there is no
advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness.

### [310] [This EEG Looks Like These EEGs: Interpretable Interictal Epileptiform Discharge Detection With ProtoEEG-kNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20846)
*Dennis Tang,Jon Donnelly,Alina Jade Barnett,Lesia Semenova,Jin Jing,Peter Hadar,Ioannis Karakis,Olga Selioutski,Kehan Zhao,M. Brandon Westover,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: ProtoEEG-kNN is introduced as an interpretable model for detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in EEG recordings, offering improved accuracy and explanations preferred by experts over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting IEDs in EEG recordings is a challenging task even for trained neurologists, and existing machine learning models lack interpretability, making it difficult for experts to validate and intervene in case of incorrect predictions.

Method: The paper proposed ProtoEEG-kNN, a machine learning model that employs case-based reasoning by comparing EEG samples to those in the training dataset. The model provides visual explanations regarding IED morphology and spatial distribution for interpretability.

Result: ProtoEEG-kNN achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting IEDs and provided interpretable explanations preferred by healthcare experts over previous machine learning models.

Conclusion: The introduction of ProtoEEG-kNN demonstrates that it is possible to achieve high accuracy in IED detection while enhancing interpretability, thus improving the collaboration between human experts and machine learning systems.

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even
trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners
to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning
algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are
uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to
understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify
incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the
human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable
model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons
by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually
demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial
distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art
accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over
existing approaches.

*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how different neural or artificial neural networks use equivalent representations for similar tasks, utilizing multiple representational similarity metrics. They adapt a fusion framework to improve separability and clustering in understanding neural structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to understand the extent to which different neural or artificial neural networks rely on similar representations to perform tasks. The goal is to address limitations from relying on single similarity metrics, which capture limited facets of representations, by integrating multiple complementary metrics.

Method: The authors use a suite of representational similarity metrics, such as RSA and Soft Matching, to analyze neural networks and brain regions. They then adapt the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) framework, originally developed for multi-omics data integration, to produce composite similarity profiles and improve discrimination and clustering.

Result: The study demonstrates that metrics focused on geometric and tuning structures yield stronger discrimination of regions and models compared to more flexible metrics, like linear predictability. SNF provides sharper separation and more robust composite profiles, advancing understanding of brain region and model family organization.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple similarity metrics through SNF produces clearer hierarchical structures, outperforming individual metrics. The findings highlight the importance of geometry and tuning in representing neural signatures and have implications for neuroscience and ML model analysis.

Abstract: The extent to which different neural or artificial neural networks (models)
rely on equivalent representations to support similar tasks remains a central
question in neuroscience and machine learning. Prior work has typically
compared systems using a single representational similarity metric, yet each
captures only one facet of representational structure. To address this, we
leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics-each capturing a
distinct facet of representational correspondence, such as geometry, unit-level
tuning, or linear decodability-and assess brain region or model separability
using multiple complementary measures. Metrics that preserve geometric or
tuning structure (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield stronger region-based
discrimination, whereas more flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode
brain-region- or model-family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable
information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models. To
integrate these complementary representational facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a framework originally developed for multi-omics data
integration. SNF produces substantially sharper regional and model family-level
separation than any single metric and yields robust composite similarity
profiles. Moreover, clustering cortical regions using SNF-derived similarity
scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with
established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual
cortex-surpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics.

*Arnab Dey Sarkar,Bard Ermentrout*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a spiking network model of cortical rhythms involving excitatory neurons, multiple inhibitory subtypes, and VIP modulation, identifying multiple rhythms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the complex network of neuronal interactions, particularly how multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes contribute to rhythmic phenomena in the brain.

Method: A mathematical model with spiking network simulations, reduced to nine differential equations, explores interactions between neuronal subtypes.

Result: Multiple rhythmic patterns within the network were observed, and the roles of different interneuron subtypes, as well as VIP modulation, were analyzed using nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of incorporating diverse inhibitory mechanisms, adding VIP modulation to fully capture cortical rhythm generation.

Abstract: In the classic view of cortical rhythms, the interaction between excitatory
pyramidal neurons (E) and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons (I) has been shown to
be sufficient to generate gamma and beta band rhythms. However, it is now clear
that there are multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes and that they play
important roles in the generation of these rhythms. In this paper we develop a
spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional
interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from
the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are
modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from
other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine
differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and
synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances
of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we
explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role
of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.

*Guoying Sun,Weiyu Guo,Tong Shao,Yang Yang,Haijin Zeng,Jie Liu,Jingyong Su*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainCognizer, a model for decoding visual stimuli from brain signals using fMRI, addressing the challenges of visual fidelity in reconstructed images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome information asymmetry in brain signals and improve fine-grained visual fidelity in reconstructed images from fMRI data.

Method: BrainCognizer uses two modules: the Cognitive Integration Module for extracting hierarchical semantics and the Cognitive Correlation Module for maintaining contextual associations across regions.

Result: BrainCognizer demonstrates improved intra-region semantic consistency and inter-region contextual associations, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances brain decoding performance and provides insights into the relationships between visual patterns and brain functions.

Abstract: Brain decoding is a key neuroscience field that reconstructs the visual
stimuli from brain activity with fMRI, which helps illuminate how the brain
represents the world. fMRI-to-image reconstruction has achieved impressive
progress by leveraging diffusion models. However, brain signals infused with
prior knowledge and associations exhibit a significant information asymmetry
when compared to raw visual features, still posing challenges for decoding fMRI
representations under the supervision of images. Consequently, the
reconstructed images often lack fine-grained visual fidelity, such as missing
attributes and distorted spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we
propose BrainCognizer, a novel brain decoding model inspired by human visual
cognition, which explores multi-level semantics and correlations without
fine-tuning of generative models. Specifically, BrainCognizer introduces two
modules: the Cognitive Integration Module which incorporates prior human
knowledge to extract hierarchical region semantics; and the Cognitive
Correlation Module which captures contextual semantic relationships across
regions. Incorporating these two modules enhances intra-region semantic
consistency and maintains inter-region contextual associations, thereby
facilitating fine-grained brain decoding. Moreover, we quantitatively interpret
our components from a neuroscience perspective and analyze the associations
between different visual patterns and brain functions. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that BrainCognizer outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on multiple evaluation metrics.

*Craig Sanders,Billy Dickson,Sahaj Singh Maini,Robert Nosofsky,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores whether machines align with human cognition and introduces a method to probe their internal geometry using vision-language models (VLMs). Results show VLMs predict human behavior better than spaces created from human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in understanding whether machines can mirror human-like representation for cognitive tasks and overcoming measurement bottlenecks in cognitive science.

Method: The study uses pairwise similarity judgments generated by VLMs, coupled with multidimensional scaling, to analyze their representational geometry and compare it with human perceptual spaces.

Result: VLM-derived spaces show strong alignment with human perceptual dimensions and better predict human classification behavior than human judgment-based spaces.

Conclusion: Vision-language models provide a scalable avenue to model human cognition effectively and capture denoised perceptual structures that correspond to human behavior patterns in categorization tasks.

Abstract: In cognitive science and AI, a longstanding question is whether machines
learn representations that align with those of the human mind. While current
models show promise, it remains an open question whether this alignment is
superficial or reflects a deeper correspondence in the underlying dimensions of
representation. Here we introduce a methodology to probe the internal geometry
of vision-language models (VLMs) by having them generate pairwise similarity
judgments for a complex set of natural objects. Using multidimensional scaling,
we recover low-dimensional psychological spaces and find that their axes show a
strong correspondence with the principal axes of human perceptual space.
Critically, when this AI-derived representational geometry is used as the input
to a classic exemplar model of categorization, it predicts human classification
behavior more accurately than a space constructed from human judgments
themselves. This suggests that VLMs can capture an idealized or `denoised' form
of human perceptual structure. Our work provides a scalable method to overcome
a measurement bottleneck in cognitive science and demonstrates that foundation
models can learn a representational geometry that is functionally relevant for
modeling key aspects of human cognition, such as categorization.

TL;DR: The paper enhances Poisson GLMs for neural spike train analysis by developing Monte Carlo and polynomial approximation methods for continuous-time data, achieving higher accuracy and scalability than traditional binned approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in temporal resolution and scalability caused by discretizing spike times in standard neural data analysis using binned Poisson GLMs.

Method: Developed Monte Carlo methods and polynomial approximations for continuous-time Poisson GLMs, with exponentially scaled Laguerre polynomials as temporal basis for accurate filter identification and computational efficiency.

Result: The methods provided better accuracy and scalability compared to binned GLMs, were validated on synthetic and rodent hippocampus spike-time data, and revealed functional connectivity aligned with known anatomical properties.

Conclusion: This approach enables precise and scalable neural data analysis, suitable for large-scale recordings, with open-source GPU-optimized implementations available for the neuroscience community.

Abstract: The Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is a foundational tool for
analyzing neural spike train data. However, standard implementations rely on
discretizing spike times into binned count data, limiting temporal resolution
and scalability. Here, we develop Monte Carlo (MC) methods and polynomial
approximations (PA) to the continuous-time analog of these models, and show
them to be advantageous over their discrete-time counterparts. Further, we
propose using a set of exponentially scaled Laguerre polynomials as an
orthogonal temporal basis, which improves filter identification and yields
closed-form integral solutions under the polynomial approximation. Applied to
both synthetic and real spike-time data from rodent hippocampus, our methods
demonstrate superior accuracy and scalability compared to traditional binned
GLMs, enabling functional connectivity inference in large-scale neural
recordings that are temporally precise on the order of synaptic dynamical
timescales and in agreement with known anatomical properties of hippocampal
subregions. We provide open-source implementations of both MC and PA
estimators, optimized for GPU acceleration, to facilitate adoption in the
neuroscience community.

*Ethan Hwang,Hossein Adeli,Wenxuan Guo,Andrew Luo,Nikolaus Kriegeskorte*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper presents an advanced in silico approach employing encoder-decoder transformer models to explore and discover category selectivity in brain regions, offering insights into visual information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mapping brain activity rely on preconceived category hypotheses or linear encoding models, limiting the understanding of functional selectivity in the cortex.

Method: The authors utilized an encoder-decoder transformer model with a brain-region-to-image-feature cross-attention mechanism to uncover nonlinear mappings between brain activity and semantic image features. They also used generative models and large datasets to generate images that activate specific brain regions.

Result: The approach identified brain regions with complex, compositional semantic selectivity, validated through in silico experiments between subjects.

Conclusion: Their framework opens up a data-driven pathway for hypothesis generation and testing regarding visual selectivity in the human brain, with potential applications in guiding fMRI experiments.

Abstract: A fine-grained account of functional selectivity in the cortex is essential
for understanding how visual information is processed and represented in the
brain. Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple
category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived
hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have
sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically
linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven
discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder-decoder
transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to
image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between
high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the
brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity
of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and
large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate
each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional
selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico
both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a "digital twin"
offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses
about visual selectivity in the human brain - hypotheses that can guide future
fMRI experiments. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy demonstrates significant potential in neuromodulation, particularly with pulsed wave (PW) mode enhancing brain efficiency and connectivity, observed through EEG microstate analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the neural mechanisms of PW tPBM therapy and overcome barriers to optimizing its protocol for neuromodulation of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Method: A randomized single-blind crossover study was conducted with 29 participants, comparing PW, sham, and continuous wave (CW) modes, utilizing EEG microstate analysis alongside machine learning methods and Shapley additive explanations analysis.

Result: PW tPBM therapy significantly enhanced global and local efficiency, brain network betweenness centrality, and mean durations in microstate C. Machine learning identified key features of microstate C, with optimization yielding high AUC performance of 0.956.

Conclusion: PW tPBM therapy modulates microstate C-specific brain patterns, suggesting reversible biomarkers for therapy optimization and personalized neuromodulation approaches.

Abstract: Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) therapy is an emerging, non-invasive
neuromodulation technique that has demonstrated considerable potential in the
field of neuropsychiatric disorders. Several studies have found that pulsed
wave (PW) tPBM therapy yields superior biomodulatory effects. However, its
neural mechanisms are still unknown which poses a significant barrier to the
development of an optimized protocol. A randomized, single-blind study
including 29 participants was conducted using a crossover design, with sham and
continuous wave (CW) groups as controls. The EEG microstate analysis was
utilized to explore the relative variations in temporal parameters and brain
functional connectivity. To further elucidate the dynamic activity patterns of
microstates, a 10-repeat 10-fold cross-validation with nine machine learning
algorithms and kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed.
Results indicated that the pulsed wave mode enhanced the global efficiency,
local efficiency, and betweenness centrality of microstate C in brain
functional networks as well as the mean durations parameter achieving a middle
to large effect size, with superior effects compared to the sham and continuous
wave groups. Furthermore, the support vector machine based on the radial basis
function method with kernel Shapley additive explanations analysis demonstrated
the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) reaching 0.956, and
found that the 8 of top-10 microstate features related to microstate C
contributed most significantly to the PW mode. In conclusion, the EEG
microstate analysis found that PW tPBM therapy modulates the microstate
C-specific patterns in the human brain, suggesting that microstate dynamics may
serve as a state-dependent biomarker for the optimization of tPBM protocol.

### [318] [Contribution of task-irrelevant stimuli to drift of neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21588)
*Farhad Pashakhanloo*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates representational drift in neural systems during lifelong learning, focusing on task-irrelevant stimuli's noise in different setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding representational drift is important for uncovering mechanisms of lifelong learning and adaptation in neural systems.

Method: The study uses theoretical analysis and simulations involving Hebbian-based learning rules, stochastic gradient descent, and various neural architectures.

Result: Drift is influenced by the variance and dimension of task-irrelevant subspace, differing from the effects of synaptic noise based on Gaussian distributions.

Conclusion: Linking stimulus structure, task, and learning rules to drift can provide insights into underlying brain computations and behavior.

Abstract: Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data
and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn
from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that,
even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations
can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift.
Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift
is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a
systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the
connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we
characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show
that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent
learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the
representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we
demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and
Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to
autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that
the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the
task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different
qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than
those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the
structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and
could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying
computation in the brain.

### [319] [Exponential Convergence Guarantees for Iterative Markovian Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20871)
*Marta Gentiloni Silveri,Giovanni Conforti,Alain Durmus*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) in the Schrödinger Bridge problem, under mild conditions and large time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Schrödinger Bridge problem is key in fields like computational optimal transport and generative modeling, but existing methods lack quantitative, non-asymptotic convergence guarantees.

Method: The authors analyze IMF's exponential convergence under structural assumptions of log-concave or weakly log-concave reference measures and marginal distributions. The method utilizes novel contraction results for the Markovian projection operator.

Result: Non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees are established for IMF in two regimes where the distributions are log-concave or weakly log-concave.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical foundations for Schrödinger Bridge methods, including DSBM, by proving quantitative convergence guarantees under practical assumptions.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem has become a fundamental tool in
computational optimal transport and generative modeling. To address this
problem, ideal methods such as Iterative Proportional Fitting and Iterative
Markovian Fitting (IMF) have been proposed-alongside practical approximations
like Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge and its Matching (DSBM) variant. While
previous work have established asymptotic convergence guarantees for IMF, a
quantitative, non-asymptotic understanding remains unknown. In this paper, we
provide the first non-asymptotic exponential convergence guarantees for IMF
under mild structural assumptions on the reference measure and marginal
distributions, assuming a sufficiently large time horizon. Our results
encompass two key regimes: one where the marginals are log-concave, and another
where they are weakly log-concave. The analysis relies on new contraction
results for the Markovian projection operator and paves the way to theoretical
guarantees for DSBM.

*Antônio H. Ribeiro,David Vävinggren,Dave Zachariah,Thomas B. Schön,Francis Bach*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a new adversarial training technique in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) that shifts adversarial perturbations to feature space rather than input space, enabling efficient optimization and enhanced generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods are computationally expensive due to min-max optimization problems, limiting their practical application. This work aims to address this inefficiency.

Method: The authors reformulate adversarial training by focusing on feature-space perturbations in RKHS. This approach allows for the exact solution of the inner maximization problem and employs an efficient optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. The method includes a regularization mechanism to adapt to noise level and smoothness automatically.

Result: This method provides generalization bounds and demonstrates good performance both in clean and adversarial conditions during empirical evaluations. The framework is extended to handle multiple kernel learning.

Conclusion: The proposed feature-space adversarial training in RKHS is computationally efficient, adaptable to various conditions (noise and smoothness), and effective in ensuring model robustness across different settings.

Abstract: Adversarial training has emerged as a key technique to enhance model
robustness against adversarial input perturbations. Many of the existing
methods rely on computationally expensive min-max problems that limit their
application in practice. We propose a novel formulation of adversarial training
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, shifting from input to feature-space
perturbations. This reformulation enables the exact solution of inner
maximization and efficient optimization. It also provides a regularized
estimator that naturally adapts to the noise level and the smoothness of the
underlying function. We establish conditions under which the feature-perturbed
formulation is a relaxation of the original problem and propose an efficient
optimization algorithm based on iterative kernel ridge regression. We provide
generalization bounds that help to understand the properties of the method. We
also extend the formulation to multiple kernel learning. Empirical evaluation
shows good performance in both clean and adversarial settings.

Motivation: To explore how graphons and their convergence rates inform the transferability and performance analysis of GNNs.

Method: The study summarized known spectral convergence rates based on different continuity assumptions and evaluated theoretical bounds with synthetic and real-world data.

Result: The results show tradeoffs between assumptions and convergence rates; empirical findings demonstrated tightness of theoretical bounds.

Conclusion: Graphons provide a reliable framework for analyzing convergence in GNNs, giving insights into transferability under different conditions of continuity.

Abstract: Graphons, as limits of graph sequences, provide a framework for analyzing the
asymptotic behavior of graph neural operators. Spectral convergence of sampled
graphs to graphons yields operator-level convergence rates, enabling
transferability analyses of GNNs. This note summarizes known bounds under no

### [322] [Doubly-Regressing Approach for Subgroup Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21091)
*Kyungseon Lee,Kunwoong Kim,Jihu Lee,Dongyoon Yang,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses subgroup fairness in AI with multiple sensitive attributes, proposing an efficient algorithm to tackle computational and data sparsity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgroup fairness in AI applications faces challenges with increasing sensitive attributes, leading to computational burdens and sparse data for small subgroups.

Method: The authors formalize a new fairness notion (subgroup-subset fairness), introduce supremum IPM as a distributional measure, and develop the DRAF algorithm to efficiently address fairness gaps.

Result: The DRAF algorithm reduces computational demands and demonstrates superior fairness performance on benchmark datasets, especially with many sensitive attributes and small subgroups.

Conclusion: DRAF is effective and computationally efficient for ensuring subgroup fairness in scenarios with numerous sensitive attributes and small subgroups.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications
of AI.
  Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when
multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present.
  However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups
increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity
problem (subgroups with too small sizes).
  In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness
which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample
sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute).
  To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce
a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral
Probability Metric (supIPM).
  Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial
learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate
fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing
supIPM.
  Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper
bound of supIPM.
  Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in
benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is
large so that many subgroups are very small.

### [323] [Enforcing Calibration in Multi-Output Probabilistic Regression with Pre-rank Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21273)
*Naomi Desobry,Elnura Zhalieva,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a regularization framework for achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression models, demonstrating significant calibration improvements without losing predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many probabilistic models struggle with achieving accurate multivariate calibration in multi-output regression tasks, making reliable decision-making harder.

Method: The study proposes a general regularization framework that enforces multivariate calibration during the training process by penalizing deviations from uniform distributions in projected probability transforms (PITs). A new PCA-based diagnostic pre-rank tool is also introduced.

Result: Experiments on 18 real-world datasets show that unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated. The proposed methods significantly improve calibration across all tested settings while maintaining predictive performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enforces multivariate calibration, enhancing model reliability for decision-making without adversely affecting accuracy.

Abstract: Probabilistic models must be well calibrated to support reliable
decision-making. While calibration in single-output regression is well studied,
defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression
remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate
calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,
which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to
univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,
we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to
enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank
functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest
density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces
calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral
transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a
regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.
Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both
marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new
PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal
variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality
reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that
unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods
significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without
sacrificing predictive accuracy.

*Jung-hun Kim,Milan Vojnović,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient frameworks for the combinatorial semi-bandit problem, minimizing oracle calls while maintaining strong regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability of combinatorial semi-bandit problems is constrained by the high cost of combinatorial optimization requiring oracle queries at each round.

Method: Develop oracle-efficient frameworks that reduce oracle query frequency to logarithmic levels while ensuring tight theoretical regret bounds.

Result: Presented algorithms achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries for worst-case linear rewards and propose covariance-adaptive variants for improved performance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates significant improvement in scalability for combinatorial semi-bandit problems by minimizing the oracle queries while sustaining strong regret performance with theoretical rigor.

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem where an agent selects a
subset of base arms and receives individual feedback. While this generalizes
the classical multi-armed bandit and has broad applicability, its scalability
is limited by the high cost of combinatorial optimization, requiring oracle
queries at every round. To tackle this, we propose oracle-efficient frameworks
that significantly reduce oracle calls while maintaining tight regret
guarantees. For the worst-case linear reward setting, our algorithms achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret using only $O(\log\log T)$ oracle queries. We also
propose covariance-adaptive algorithms that leverage noise structure for
improved regret, and extend our approach to general (non-linear) rewards.
Overall, our methods reduce oracle usage from linear to (doubly) logarithmic in
time, with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Johann Flemming Gloy,Simon Olsson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces HollowFlow, a scalable flow-based generative model using a novel non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN) to improve efficiency in sampling and likelihood computations for Boltzmann Generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow and diffusion-based models face scalability issues due to prohibitive computational costs in sample likelihood evaluations, especially for large systems.

Method: HollowFlow leverages a block-diagonal Jacobian structure for more efficient likelihood evaluations and introduces the adaptable NoBGNN framework for scaling performance.

Result: The proposed model achieves theoretical and practical speed-ups, demonstrated by up to 100-fold improvements in sampling and likelihood evaluations on increasingly large systems.

Conclusion: HollowFlow successfully addresses computational bottlenecks in high-dimensional scientific domains, showcasing scalability and versatility for large systems.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion-based models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific
applications, particularly for sampling non-normalized probability
distributions, as exemplified by Boltzmann Generators (BGs). A critical
challenge in deploying these models is their reliance on sample likelihood
computations, which scale prohibitively with system size $n$, often rendering
them infeasible for large-scale problems. To address this, we introduce
$\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel
non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal
Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number
of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a
significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our
framework generalizes: $\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based
architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training
BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling
and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our
theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\times$
speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for
high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational
bottlenecks.

### [326] [Fisher meets Feynman: score-based variational inference with a product of experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21598)
*Diana Cai,Robert M. Gower,David M. Blei,Lawrence K. Saul*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel family of distributions for black-box variational inference (BBVI), modeled as weighted products of experts (PoE) with each expert being proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. The authors reformulate these distributions to enable sampling for BBVI, using a latent variable model involving auxiliary Dirichlet random variables and leveraging insights from quantum field theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of representing complex distributions (e.g., with skew, heavy tails, or multiple modes) in black-box variational inference (BBVI) while maintaining tractability and efficiency.

Method: The approach models distributions as weighted products of multivariate $t$-distribution experts. A Feynman identity reformulates these as a latent variable model with auxiliary Dirichlet variables, enabling efficient sampling. Optimization involves minimizing a regularized Fisher divergence using an iterative procedure based on convex quadratic programming.

Result: The method produces a near-optimal weighting of experts through exponential convergence and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic and real-world target distributions.

Conclusion: This proposed family of PoE models enhances BBVI by effectively capturing complex target distributions while ensuring computational feasibility. The use of latent variable modeling and score-matching optimization techniques underpins the method's success.

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for
black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a
weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is
proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can
model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them
for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do
this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with
auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a
Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field
theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,
$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial
latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples
which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.
Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the
exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each
iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match
the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn
from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic
program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge
exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by
evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target
distributions.

Conclusion: This approach advances the benchmarking of multimodal learning techniques and mutual information estimation.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for generating highly multimodal datasets with

mutual information using a flow-based generative model and a structured causal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand exact factors in data distribution that lead to excess risk in PCA and improve its theoretical understanding.

Method: Establishing a central limit theorem, deriving asymptotic distribution for PCA’s reconstruction loss and proving mathematical bounds under Grassmannian structure.

Result: Non-asymptotic and asymptotic bounds, along with proof for PCA’s excess risk behavior linked to data distribution properties.

Conclusion: The paper precisely determines data properties dictating excess risk in PCA, achieving stronger mathematical guarantees via novel results on Grassmannian quotient.

Abstract: What property of the data distribution determines the excess risk of
principal component analysis? In this paper, we provide a precise answer to
this question. We establish a central limit theorem for the error of the
principal subspace estimated by PCA, and derive the asymptotic distribution of
its excess risk under the reconstruction loss. We obtain a non-asymptotic upper
bound on the excess risk of PCA that recovers, in the large sample limit, our
asymptotic characterization. Underlying our contributions is the following
result: we prove that the negative block Rayleigh quotient, defined on the
Grassmannian, is generalized self-concordant along geodesics emanating from its
minimizer of maximum rotation less than $\pi/4$.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper investigates the problem of forecasting in performative settings, where predictions influence outcomes, and proposes methods to ensure accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of forecasting in performative settings, where conventional models fail due to the interaction between predictions and outcomes.

Method: The authors propose solutions such as (i) eliciting separating forecasts for decision-theoretic settings and (ii) using unbiased scoring approaches to achieve correct forecasts.

Result: The study provides theoretical proofs of the failures of classical methods and introduces new models and estimators for accurate forecasting under these challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of performative forecasting and resolves open problems in this domain by introducing techniques that guarantee reliable predictions.

Abstract: Performative predictions are forecasts which influence the outcomes they aim
to predict, undermining the existence of correct forecasts and standard methods
of elicitation and estimation. We show that conditioning forecasts on
covariates that separate them from the outcome renders the target distribution
forecast-invariant, guaranteeing well-posedness of the forecasting problem.
However, even under this condition, classical proper scoring rules fail to
elicit correct forecasts. We prove a general impossibility result and identify
two solutions: (i) in decision-theoretic settings, elicitation of correct and
incentive-compatible forecasts is possible if forecasts are separating; (ii)
scoring with unbiased estimates of the divergence between the forecast and the
induced distribution of the target variable yields correct forecasts. Applying
these insights to parameter estimation, conditional forecasts and proper
scoring rules enable performatively stable estimation of performatively correct
parameters, resolving the issues raised by Perdomo et al. (2020). Our results
expose fundamental limits of classical forecast evaluation and offer new tools
for reliable and accurate forecasting in performative settings.

*Alejandro Lopez-Montes,Robert Seifert,Astrid Delker,Guido Boening,Jiahui Wang,Christoph Clement,Ali Afshar-Oromieh,Axel Rominger,Kuangyu Shi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to create 3D activity maps using patient-specific AI models from 2D planar images for improved nuclear medicine dosimetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dosimetry techniques in nuclear medicine are challenging due to expensive 3D SPECT imaging or limited functionality of 2D planar scintigraphy. This study aims to make 3D imaging more accessible and efficient.

Method: The authors developed a patient-specific dataset with 3D uptake maps and utilized AI models (3DUnet and diffusion models) combined with reinforcement learning for generating 3D activity maps from planar images.

Result: The methodology achieved a ~20% MAE reduction and ~5% increase in SSIM through reinforcement learning, showing improved organ delineation and anatomy prediction. The diffusion model combined with patient-specific training yielded SSIM=0.89 in simulations and 0.73 compared to SPECT acquisitions.

Conclusion: This approach enables 3D dosimetry using planar scintigraphy, eliminating the need for costly SPECT imaging, potentially revolutionizing nuclear medicine applications.

Abstract: In this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to
generate 3D activity maps from two 2D planar images (anterior and posterior).
The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional
methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine
where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as
177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT
acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate
3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry
applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point
dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific
dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the
anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use
of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D
planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar
acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement
learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ
delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with
patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for
simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an
hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of
paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using
only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT
leveraging the pre-therapy information of the patients.

Motivation: To establish a universal framework for analyzing sparse random graph models, especially for those relevant to message-passing graph neural networks.

Method: Introduces a new local convergence concept ('color convergence') based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and proposes the universal Refined Configuration Model (RCM).

Result: Color convergence is shown to fully describe random graphs suitable for graph neural networks, and the RCM is proven universal among locally tree-like graph models.

Conclusion: The work provides tools for understanding local graph convergence and characterizes random trees as local graph limits, aiding in the study of sparse random graphs.

Abstract: Local convergence has emerged as a fundamental tool for analyzing sparse
random graph models. We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color
convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully
characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for
message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined
Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the
configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence
among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi,
stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a
complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of
such graphs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comprehensive framework called Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) for efficient and accurate simulations of chemical kinetics, overcoming challenges like computational costs and model instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient large-scale simulations for estimating reaction rates and chemical stability are limited due to computational costs, short simulation timescales, and difficulties with transition state regions.

Method: The OT-GP framework combines physics-aware optimal transport metrics, surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning for simulation methods, and software enhancements to address simulation challenges.

Result: The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance and validated its approach through large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach transforms theoretical concepts around chemical kinetics simulations into practical tools for discovery, establishing a modular and representation-first methodology.

Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet
efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite
advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by
short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and
struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction
network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational
cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like
harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point
searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by
overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical
representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal
Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal
transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the
potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.
Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce
reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the
final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are
specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first,
modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and
Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding
theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.

Result: The models demonstrate strengths and limitations in producing faithful child-only summaries while preserving disfluencies. Reliability of the models across human and automated evaluations is assessed.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the performance of LALMs in handling disfluent child speech and offers guidance for implementation in clinical and educational applications.

Abstract: Child speech differs from adult speech in acoustics, prosody, and language
development, and disfluencies (repetitions, prolongations, blocks) further
challenge Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and downstream Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recent large audio-language models (LALMs) demonstrate strong
cross-modal audio understanding; however, their behavior in disfluent child
speech remains underexplored. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs in two
settings: an interview (mixed speakers) and a reading task (single child). The
tasks are (i) single-channel source separation to isolate the child and (ii)
child-only summarization that preserves clinically relevant disfluencies and
avoids adult-speech leakage.
  Evaluation combines Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge, human expert
ratings, and BERTScore (F1), and we report agreement between models and between
models and humans to assess reliability. Our findings delineate the conditions
under which LALMs produce faithful child-only summaries from mixed audio and
where they fail, offering practical guidance for clinical and educational
deployments. We provide prompts and evaluation scripts to support replication.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable and generalizable method for analyzing electrophysiological (ExG) signals in daily, uncontrolled environments using a novel tokenization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in building foundation models for ExG signals, specifically the lack of data diversity and task-specific model designs, which hinder generalization across everyday tasks.

Method: The authors developed an unobtrusive, earphone-based prototype for collecting free-living ExG data and applied a Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT) method for signal processing.

Result: PiMT demonstrated superior performance in recognizing adaptive features and task-relevant information across various tasks on the newly introduced DailySense dataset, as well as on four public ExG benchmarks.

Conclusion: PiMT is a scalable, task-agnostic solution that enhances the capacity to monitor and analyze ExG signals in real-world settings consistently outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Electrophysiological (ExG) signals offer valuable insights into human
physiology, yet building foundation models that generalize across everyday
tasks remains challenging due to two key limitations: (i) insufficient data
diversity, as most ExG recordings are collected in controlled labs with bulky,
expensive devices; and (ii) task-specific model designs that require tailored
processing (i.e., targeted frequency filters) and architectures, which limit
generalization across tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce an
approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected
50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware
prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is
Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG
signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task
to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition
across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information.
Experiments on our new DailySense dataset-the first to enable ExG-based
analysis across five human senses-together with four public ExG benchmarks,
demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
diverse tasks.

*Vishaal Udandarao,Zhiyun Lu,Xuankai Chang,Yongqiang Wang,Violet Z. Yao,Albin Madapally Jose,Fartash Faghri,Josh Gardner,Chung-Cheng Chiu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper investigates data processing methods and their impact on training Speech-Language Models (SpeechLMs), proposing insights to create a superior model, SpeLangy, that achieves better performance despite being smaller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of controlled data-centric studies for improving Speech-Language Models (SpeechLMs) performance, particularly in Spoken Question-Answering tasks.

Method: The study explores three key aspects of speech-language data: processing web-crawled audio, constructing synthetic datasets, and interleaving text and audio segments. Controlled ablation studies were conducted to analyze their effect on model pretraining.

Result: Insights from ablation studies led to the pretraining of SpeLangy, a 3.8B-parameter SpeechLM that improves on existing larger SpeechLMs by 10.2% in absolute performance.

Conclusion: Effective data curation significantly boosts SpeechLM pretraining, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches over increasing model size for improving Spoken Question-Answering capabilities.

Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and
interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language
models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their
SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data
processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account
for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data
modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric
exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions
fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw
web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct
synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to
interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the
insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a
3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up
to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the
impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide
future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.

*Christiaan M. Geldenhuys,Günther Tonitz,Thomas R. Niesler*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces the boundary proposal network (BPN) to improve sound event detection (SED) of baleen whale calls by reducing false positives and enhancing minority-class detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SED systems include false positive detections and difficulties in minority-class detection, which hinder the accurate identification of whale calls.

Method: The BPN uses intermediate latent representations from an existing SED system's backbone model to gate final outputs, inspired by image object detection techniques. The approach also optimizes hyperparameters via forward-search and backward-search methods.

Result: BPN improved precision by 16.8%, F1-scores for minority classes (d-calls by 21.3% and bp-calls by 9.4%), and achieved a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, a 9.8% absolute increase from the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed BPN significantly enhances the precision and F1-scores for baleen whale call detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating false positives and improving minority-class classification.

Abstract: While recent sound event detection (SED) systems can identify baleen whale
calls in marine audio, challenges related to false positive and minority-class
detection persist. We propose the boundary proposal network (BPN), which
extends an existing lightweight SED system. The BPN is inspired by work in
image object detection and aims to reduce the number of false positive
detections. It achieves this by using intermediate latent representations
computed within the backbone classification model to gate the final output.
When added to an existing SED system, the BPN achieves a 16.8 % absolute
increase in precision, as well as 21.3 % and 9.4 % improvements in the F1-score
for minority-class d-calls and bp-calls, respectively. We further consider two
approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a
forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and
frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable
performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The
complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of
0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.

*Arshdeep Singh,Vinayak Abrol,Mark D. Plumbley*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Pruned Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) are proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional CNNs in modeling multi-channel audio data, achieving reduced computational complexity and parameter count while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs struggle to fully utilize inter-channel correlations in multi-channel audio inputs, leading to suboptimal feature learning, and QCNNs address this issue. However, QCNNs suffer from high computational costs, making them impractical for resource-constrained platforms.

Method: The study utilizes knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning techniques to simplify QCNNs, reducing inference latency and computational overhead while preserving their performance capabilities.

Result: Pruned QCNNs achieve reduced computational costs by 50% and parameter counts by 80%, maintain performance comparable to conventional CNNs, and generalize effectively across various audio classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pruned QCNNs are efficient and practical for multi-channel audio classification, addressing both computational constraints and inter-channel dependency modeling limitations present in typical CNN architectures.

Abstract: Conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the real domain have
been widely used for audio classification. However, their convolution
operations process multi-channel inputs independently, limiting the ability to
capture correlations among channels. This can lead to suboptimal feature
learning, particularly for complex audio patterns such as multi-channel
spectrogram representations. Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)
address this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture
inter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable
parameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio
signals. However, QCNNs exhibit higher computational complexity due to the
overhead of quaternion operations, resulting in increased inference latency and
reduced efficiency compared to conventional CNNs, posing challenges for
deployment on resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, this
study explores knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning, to reduce the
computational complexity of QCNNs while maintaining performance. Our
experiments on audio classification reveal that pruning QCNNs achieves similar
or superior performance compared to KD while requiring less computational
effort. Compared to conventional CNNs and Transformer-based architectures,
pruned QCNNs achieve competitive performance with a reduced learnable parameter
count and computational complexity. On the AudioSet dataset, pruned QCNNs
reduce computational cost by 50\% and parameter count by 80\%, while
maintaining performance comparable to the conventional CNNs. Furthermore,
pruned QCNNs generalize well across multiple audio classification benchmarks,
including GTZAN for music genre recognition, ESC-50 for environmental sound
classification and RAVDESS for speech emotion recognition.

### [338] [A Unified Approach to Submodular Maximization Under Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21128)
*Kshipra Bhawalkar,Yang Cai,Zhe Feng,Christopher Liaw,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper presents a meta-algorithm for solving noisy submodular maximization problems, transforming robust algorithms for exact submodular maximization into ones for noisy settings while preserving their approximation guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maximizing submodular functions using noisy value oracles, which are common in practical applications, and to improve approximation guarantees in such noisy contexts.

Method: The authors propose a meta-algorithm that uses robust algorithms for exact submodular maximization as a foundation and adapts them for noisy settings. This transformation ensures that the approximation guarantees of the original algorithms are retained.

Result: The meta-algorithm achieves a $(1-1/e)$-approximation for monotone submodular maximization under matroid constraints and a $1/e$-approximation for non-monotone submodular maximization with matroid constraints. For unconstrained non-monotone submodular maximization, it achieves a $1/2$-approximation.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-algorithm efficiently bridges exact and noisy submodular maximization settings, expanding the utility of robust submodular algorithms in scenarios involving noise, while maintaining their approximation guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a
noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar
to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple
calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this
model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm
for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and
Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone
submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this
paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm
for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an
algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By
using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we
obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone
(resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint
under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy
algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone)
submodular maximization under noise.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework combining FEM and graph neural networks for solving challenging inverse problems in PDEs, showcasing superior performance in numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of solving ill-posed inverse problems governed by PDEs using a combination of numerical methods and machine learning.

Method: An iterative approach alternating between FEM-based inversion and graph neural networks used as regularizers leveraging FEM's graph structure.

Result: The new framework outperforms classical regularization techniques, achieving high reconstruction accuracy in difficult problem settings.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates robustness, interpretability, and generalizability in solving inverse problems, establishing a new direction for combining physics-based models with learned regularization.

Abstract: We present a framework for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse
problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), where the target
coefficients of the forward operator are recovered through an iterative
regularization scheme that alternates between FEM-based inversion and learned
graph neural regularization. The forward problem is numerically solved using
the finite element method (FEM), enabling applicability to a wide range of
geometries and PDEs. By leveraging the graph structure inherent to FEM
discretizations, we employ physics-inspired graph neural networks as learned
regularizers, providing a robust, interpretable, and generalizable alternative
to standard approaches. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework
outperforms classical regularization techniques and achieves accurate
reconstructions even in highly ill-posed scenarios.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Senses, an energy-saving solution for edge IoT networks, using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to reduce data redundancy and optimize device lifetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rapidly increasing sensor data due to the growing IoT devices, and the resulting energy consumption and redundancy issues.

Method: Senses utilizes Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to adjust sensor coverage dynamically, implement data de-duplication, partition duplicate data, and balance device operational durations.

Result: Testbed experiments and simulations demonstrate that Senses reduces energy consumption by 11.37% on control devices and extends the IoT network's operational duration by 20%.

Conclusion: Senses effectively mitigates energy inefficiency and data redundancy in edge IoT networks, enhancing sustainability and device longevity.

Abstract: As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices continuously grows and
application scenarios constantly enrich, the volume of sensor data experiences
an explosive increase. However, substantial data demands considerable energy
during computation and transmission. Redundant deployment or mobile assistance
is essential to cover the target area reliably with fault-prone sensors.
Consequently, the ``butterfly effect" may appear during the IoT operation,
since unreasonable data overlap could result in many duplicate data. To this
end, we propose Senses, a novel online energy saving solution for edge IoT
networks, with the insight of sensing and storing less at the network edge by
adopting Muti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Senses achieves data
de-duplication by dynamically adjusting sensor coverage at the sensor level.
For exceptional cases where sensor coverage cannot be altered, Senses conducts
data partitioning and eliminates redundant data at the controller level.
Furthermore, at the global level, considering the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
Senses balances the operational duration among the devices to prolong the
overall operational duration of edge IoT networks. We evaluate the performance
of Senses through testbed experiments and simulations. The results show that
Senses saves 11.37% of energy consumption on control devices and prolongs 20%
overall operational duration of the IoT device network.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Wireless rechargeable sensor networks overcome the limitations of battery-powered sensor networks for remote applications. The paper proposes an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize energy efficiency and node survival rate, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery-powered sensor networks face limitations in remote areas due to restricted operational lifespans and high maintenance demands. Wireless rechargeable sensor networks with mobile chargers address these limitations by extending the network's lifespan.

Method: The authors designed a combined evolutionary deep reinforcement learning algorithm featuring LSTM-based policy networks, prospective increment models, and time-varying Pareto policy evaluation to address NP-hard optimization challenges in dynamic WRSNs.

Result: The proposed algorithm improved node survival rates and energy efficiency, delivered diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, and achieved faster convergence (25% speedup) and better adaptation to dynamic conditions compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach successfully balances energy efficiency and node survival in wireless rechargeable sensor networks, enabling effective long-term operations in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in sensor networks, conventional battery-powered
sensor networks suffer from limited operational lifespans and frequent
maintenance requirements that severely constrain their deployment in remote and
inaccessible environments. As such, wireless rechargeable sensor networks
(WRSNs) with mobile charging capabilities offer a promising solution to extend
network lifetime. However, WRSNs face critical challenges from the inherent
trade-off between maximizing the node survival rates and maximizing charging
energy efficiency under dynamic operational conditions. In this paper, we
investigate a typical scenario where mobile chargers move and charge the
sensor, thereby maintaining the network connectivity while minimizing the
energy waste. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem
that simultaneously maximizes the network node survival rate and mobile charger
energy usage efficiency across multiple time slots, which presents NP-hard
computational complexity with long-term temporal dependencies that make
traditional optimization approaches ineffective. To address these challenges,
we propose an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning
algorithm, which integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based policy
network for temporal pattern recognition, a multilayer perceptron-based
prospective increment model for future state prediction, and a time-varying
Pareto policy evaluation method for dynamic preference adaptation. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms existing approaches in balancing node survival rate and energy
efficiency while generating diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, the
LSTM-enhanced policy network converges 25% faster than conventional networks,
with the time-varying evaluation method effectively adapting to dynamic
conditions.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: TURBOTEST proposes a machine learning framework to optimize speed test processes for the internet, achieving significant data savings without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internet speed tests currently generate massive data traffic, and there is a need to reduce this burden while retaining test accuracy.

Method: The approach separates throughput prediction from test termination, using machine learning regressors and classifiers, alongside transport-level features like RTT, retransmissions, and congestion window. It introduces an adaptive mechanism with adjustable accuracy tolerance.

Result: Evaluating TURBOTEST on 173,000 speed tests demonstrated significant data savings (2-4x higher than competing methods) while reducing median error.

Conclusion: TURBOTEST provides an efficient, accurate, and scalable solution for internet speed tests, offering adaptability and reduced data consumption.

Abstract: Internet speed tests are indispensable for users, ISPs, and policymakers, but
their static flooding-based design imposes growing costs: a single high-speed
test can transfer hundreds of megabytes, and collectively, platforms like
Ookla, M-Lab, and Fast.com generate petabytes of traffic each month. Reducing
this burden requires deciding when a test can be stopped early without
sacrificing accuracy. We frame this as an optimal stopping problem and show
that existing heuristics-static thresholds, BBR pipe-full signals, or
throughput stability rules from Fast.com and FastBTS-capture only a narrow
portion of the achievable accuracy-savings trade-off. This paper introduces
TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop
existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1)
from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final
throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to
decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer
transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside
throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance
and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on
173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly
2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing
median error. These results demonstrate that adaptive ML-based termination can
deliver accurate, efficient, and deployable speed tests at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models face slow convergence and limited theoretical understanding, especially in noise-driven likelihood estimation scenarios.

Method: The authors extend KL divergence-Fisher information relations to structured noise distributions, enabling effective modeling under noise perturbations while ensuring compatibility with diffusion training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate competitive negative log-likelihood (NLL) on CIFAR-10 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on ImageNet, without data augmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances generative model training by improving accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to data and sensor noise effects, including for discrete data.

Abstract: Generative models that maximize model likelihood have gained traction in many
practical settings. Among them, perturbation based approaches underpin many
strong likelihood estimation models, yet they often face slow convergence and
limited theoretical understanding. In this paper, we derive a tighter
likelihood bound for noise driven models to improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of maximum likelihood learning. Our key insight extends the
classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise
perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured
noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise
distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization
effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with
standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian
channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model,
showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood
(NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA
results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation,
and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system to monitor student concentration during online learning, achieving an accuracy of 88.77% and demonstrating improved focus with real-time feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of online learning highlights the challenge of accurately monitoring students' concentration, as traditional methods like questionnaires or webcams fail to provide reliable cognitive engagement insights.

Method: The authors developed a non-invasive EEG-based BCI system using FocusCalm to record brainwaves and classify attention states using machine learning (SVM with RFE), validated via intra-video questionnaires and tested with real-time feedback alerts.

Result: The proposed system achieved 88.77% accuracy using LOSO cross-validation and demonstrated statistically significant concentration improvement during feedback phases (t = 5.73, p = 0.007).

Conclusion: The developed BCI system effectively monitors concentration in real-time and provides actionable feedback that enhances learners' focus during online sessions.

Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring
of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire
assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to
provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by
mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based
approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address
these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a
non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record
brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data
were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational
video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire
assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window),
filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG
artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical
features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE)
with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention
states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been
tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention
state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a
10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback
followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if
participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A
paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant
improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.

### [346] [Designing and Evaluating Hint Generation Systems for Science Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21087)
*Anubhav Jangra,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models to generate hints for educational tasks, preventing learners from directly getting the answers and promoting active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students relying on general-purpose language models may receive instant answers without understanding concepts, which impacts their learning. Better educational strategies are needed for engagement.

Method: The authors analyze automatic hint generation using large language models, comparing static pre-generated hints to dynamic adaptive hints for guiding learners in secondary education scientific topics.

Result: A study with 41 participants revealed different learner preferences for hint strategies and showed limitations in current automated evaluation metrics for measuring these preferences.

Conclusion: Future learner-centered educational technology should carefully design hint generation systems, and there is scope to improve evaluation methods for understanding student interaction with hints.

Abstract: Large language models are influencing the education landscape, with students
relying on them in their learning process. Often implemented using
general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers,
which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the
role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active
engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the
answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we
explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that
scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting
strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints,
adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41
participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to
hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation
metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for
future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek
to develop learner-centered educational technologies.

*Ilona van der Linden,Sahana Kumar,Arnav Dixit,Aadi Sudan,Smruthi Danda,David C. Anastasiu,Kai Lukoff*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines how generative AI tools represent race and gender in occupational personas, identifying major biases and distortions across four AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and critique the portrayal of race and gender in AI-generated occupational personas, driven by concerns about fairness and representation.

Method: A large-scale audit of over 1.5 million occupational personas was conducted across 41 U.S. occupations using four generative AI models from different countries.

Result: Finds systematic underrepresentation of White (-31pp) and Black (-9pp) workers, overrepresentation of Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers, and stereotype exaggerations in AI portrayals.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of model-specific audits and accountable design practices to address biases in AI-generated content.

Abstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly used to create portrayals of people in
occupations, raising concerns about how race and gender are represented. We
conducted a large-scale audit of over 1.5 million occupational personas across
41 U.S. occupations, generated by four large language models with different AI
safety commitments and countries of origin (U.S., China, France). Compared with
Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we find two recurring patterns: systematic
shifts, where some groups are consistently under- or overrepresented, and
stereotype exaggeration, where existing demographic skews are amplified. On
average, White (--31pp) and Black (--9pp) workers are underrepresented, while
Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers are overrepresented. These
distortions can be extreme: for example, across all four models, Housekeepers
are portrayed as nearly 100\% Hispanic, while Black workers are erased from
many occupations. For HCI, these findings show provider choice materially
changes who is visible, motivating model-specific audits and accountable design
practices.

### [348] [Human and AI Trust: Trust Attitude Measurement Instrument](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21535)
*Retno Larasati*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a validated 16-item scale for measuring trust in AI systems, specifically in the context of AI medical support systems, targeting non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust is critical for acceptance and deployment of AI systems, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare. A reliable human-centered measurement tool for trust is essential.

Method: The study developed a trust measurement instrument following psychometric principles through six stages: item development, evaluation, survey administration, dimensionality testing, reliability testing, and validity testing.

Result: The six-stage process demonstrates the instrument’s reliability and validity for assessing non-expert trust in AI Medical Support Systems.

Conclusion: The proposed instrument provides a robust and systematic means to measure, compare, and understand layperson trust towards AI applications in healthcare.

Abstract: With the current progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its
increasingly broader applications, trust is seen as a required criterion for AI
usage, acceptance, and deployment. A robust measurement instrument is essential
to correctly evaluate trust from a human-centered perspective. This paper
describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument,
which follows psychometric principles, and consists of a 16-items trust scale.
The instrument was built explicitly for research in human-AI interaction to
measure trust attitudes towards AI systems from layperson (non-expert)
perspective. The use-case we used to develop the scale was in the context of AI
medical support systems (specifically cancer/health prediction). The scale
development (Measurement Item Development) and validation (Measurement Item
Evaluation) involved six research stages: item development, item evaluation,
survey administration, test of dimensionality, test of reliability, and test of
validity. The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust
measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically
measuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems.

*Jonathan Gold,Tristan Freiberg,Haruna Isah,Shirin Shahabi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces JSTprove, a toolkit that simplifies verifying AI inference through Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), ensuring privacy and trust in sensitive applications like healthcare and finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of trust, security, and accountability in AI systems integrated into critical fields like healthcare and finance.

Method: Developed JSTprove, an accessible zkML toolkit built on Polyhedra Network's Expander backend, enabling AI developers to generate and verify proofs of AI model inference with a simplified interface.

Result: JSTprove provides an end-to-end pipeline for verifiable AI inference while simplifying the complex cryptographic processes of zkML.

Conclusion: JSTprove advances zkML usability, offering a reproducible and accessible toolkit suitable for engineering and research applications, fostering community engagement and further development.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) systems into critical industries
such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has transformed decision-making
processes, but it also brings new challenges around trust, security, and
accountability. As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency
and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have
direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered
by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these
challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without
exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy.
However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic
expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper,
we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's
Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and
verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI
inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple
command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility.
We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as
well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension.
JSTprove therefore serves both as a usable zkML product for current engineering
needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production
deployments of verifiable AI.

### [350] [Securing AI Agent Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21236)
*Christoph Bühler,Matteo Biagiola,Luca Di Grazia,Guido Salvaneschi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentBound, an access control framework for MCP servers to address security concerns. It involves generating policies and enforcing them without modifying existing servers, ensuring negligible overhead and effective blockage of security threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The security risks associated with unrestricted access to MCP servers demand a solution to mitigate the broad attack surface they currently present.

Method: The authors introduce AgentBound, which combines a declarative policy mechanism inspired by Android's permission model with an enforcement engine. They also automatically generate access control policies with high accuracy from source codes.

Result: AgentBound effectively blocks major security threats, achieves 80.9% accuracy in policy generation, and ensures minimal operational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework secures MCP servers efficiently while maintaining developer productivity and encourages future research on declarative access control mechanisms for MCP security.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into AI agents that interact with
external tools and environments to perform complex tasks. The Model Context
Protocol (MCP) has become the de facto standard for connecting agents with such
resources, but security has lagged behind: thousands of MCP servers execute
with unrestricted access to host systems, creating a broad attack surface. In
this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP
servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the
Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains
malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a
dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access
control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9%
accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats
in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces
negligible overhead. Our contributions provide developers and project managers
with a practical foundation for securing MCP servers while maintaining
productivity, enabling researchers and tool builders to explore new directions
for declarative access control and MCP security.

*Lu Liu,Wuqi Zhang,Lili Wei,Hao Guan,Yongqiang Tian,Yepang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PMDetector is a hybrid framework for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities in DeFi smart contracts using static analysis and LLM-based reasoning, achieving high precision and recall rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi smart contracts manage significant funds, making them prone to price manipulation attacks via flash loans. Existing detection methods struggle to adapt to novel attacks and economic complexities.

Method: PMDetector introduces a three-stage pipeline: static taint analysis, LLM-based validation and simulation of attacks, followed by static checks to confirm results, ensuring comprehensive vulnerability filtering.

Result: PMDetector demonstrates 88% precision and 90% recall on a benchmark dataset, outperforming existing tools. It audits vulnerabilities efficiently at low cost and swift runtime using GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: PMDetector provides a proactive, adaptable, and resource-efficient solution for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities in DeFi systems, overcoming limitations of current tools.

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts manage billions of dollars,
making them a prime target for exploits. Price manipulation vulnerabilities,
often via flash loans, are a devastating class of attacks causing significant
financial losses. Existing detection methods are limited. Reactive approaches
analyze attacks only after they occur, while proactive static analysis tools
rely on rigid, predefined heuristics, limiting adaptability. Both depend on
known attack patterns, failing to identify novel variants or comprehend complex
economic logic. We propose PMDetector, a hybrid framework combining static
analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning to proactively detect
price manipulation vulnerabilities. Our approach uses a formal attack model and
a three-stage pipeline. First, static taint analysis identifies potentially
vulnerable code paths. Second, a two-stage LLM process filters paths by
analyzing defenses and then simulates attacks to evaluate exploitability.
Finally, a static analysis checker validates LLM results, retaining only
high-risk paths and generating comprehensive vulnerability reports. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we built a dataset of 73 real-world vulnerable and 288
benign DeFi protocols. Results show PMDetector achieves 88% precision and 90%
recall with Gemini 2.5-flash, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
static analysis and LLM-based approaches. Auditing a vulnerability with
PMDetector costs just $0.03 and takes 4.0 seconds with GPT-4.1, offering an
efficient and cost-effective alternative to manual audits.

*Mojtaba Eshghie,Gabriele Morello,Matteo Lauretano,Alexandre Bartel,Martin Monperrus*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FLAMES is an automated approach leveraging domain-adapted large language models to synthesize runtime guards for smart contracts, significantly improving their security against exploits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated tools fail to produce deployable defenses for smart contract vulnerabilities, costing billions annually. FLAMES aims to address this gap by offering runtime protections.

Method: FLAMES employs domain-adapted large language models fine-tuned on real-world invariants from over 514,000 verified contracts to generate Solidity 'require' statements for runtime guards.

Result: FLAMES demonstrates high compilability, semantic match quality, exploit mitigation capabilities, and successfully blocks real-world attacks, proving its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: FLAMES highlights the feasibility of using domain-adapted LLMs to automatically generate production-quality security defenses, advancing smart contract protection without human intervention.

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions of dollars annually, yet
existing automated analysis tools fail to generate deployable defenses. We
present FLAMES, a novel automated approach that synthesizes executable runtime
guards as Solidity "require" statements to harden smart contracts against
exploits. Unlike prior work that relies on vulnerability labels, symbolic
analysis, or natural language specifications, FLAMES employs domain-adapted
large language models trained through fill-in-the-middle supervised fine-tuning
on real-world invariants extracted from 514,506 verified contracts. Our
extensive evaluation across three dimensions demonstrates FLAMES's
effectiveness: (1) Compilation: FLAMES achieves 96.7% compilability for
synthesized invariant (2) Semantic Quality: on a curated test set of 5,000
challenging invariants, FLAMES produces exact or semantically equivalent
matches to ground truth in 44.5% of cases; (3) Exploit Mitigation: FLAMES
prevents 22 out of 108 real exploits (20.4%) while preserving contract
functionality, and (4) FLAMES successfully blocks the real-world APEMAGA
incident by synthesizing a pre-condition that mitigates the attack. FLAMES
establishes that domain-adapted LLMs can automatically generate
production-ready security defenses for smart contracts without requiring
vulnerability detection, formal specifications, or human intervention. We
release our code, model weights, datasets, and evaluation infrastructure to
enable reproducible research in this critical domain.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the security threats posed by Trojan attacks on CNN-based autonomous navigation systems in UAM vehicles, demonstrating significant vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the security risks posed by Trojan attacks against autonomous systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles.

Method: The researchers utilized the DroNet framework for UAAVs, created a custom dataset, trained models, and developed an evaluation framework for identifying Trojan-infected models.

Result: Trojan attacks caused accuracy to drop significantly from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on triggered data.

Conclusion: Trojan attacks represent a serious threat to UAM systems, emphasizing the need for improved resilience in these technologies.

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

### [354] [Self-Jailbreaking: Language Models Can Reason Themselves Out of Safety Alignment After Benign Reasoning Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20956)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'self-jailbreaking' in reasoning language models (RLMs), where models unintentionally bypass their safety measures after undergoing reasoning training in benign domains, fulfilling harmful requests by rationalizing them through benign assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and address the unintentional safety misalignment in reasoning language models caused by benign reasoning training, which poses risks as models comply with harmful requests through self-jailbreaking.

Method: The study examines self-jailbreaking across various RLMs, provides mechanistic insights into why it occurs through reasoning compliance dynamics, and tests minimal safety reasoning data as a mitigation measure during model training.

Result: The research reveals self-jailbreaking behavior in RLMs after benign training, understanding its mechanisms, and shows that adding minimal safety reasoning data during training effectively prevents this behavior.

Conclusion: Self-jailbreaking compromises safety in reasoning language models, but systematic augmentation with safety reasoning data during training can mitigate this issue, ensuring models remain safety-aligned while being capable.

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment
in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking.
Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs
will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One
strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to
justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful
requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card
information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of
``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign
context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,
suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the
requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:
RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after
self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful
in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking,
we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is
sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first
systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path
forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

*Soham Hans,Stacy Marsella,Sophia Hirschmann,Nikolos Gurney*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method using large language models to analyze cyber attackers' behavior from IDS logs, linking attacker actions to cognitive biases and MITRE ATT&CK techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time cybersecurity defense currently lacks the ability to infer attacker intent and strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as IDS logs.

Method: The study uses large language models with a creative prompt system to segment and interpret Suricata IDS log data, associating observed behaviors with MITRE ATT&CK techniques and attacker cognitive strategies.

Result: The framework successfully maps network-layer events to attacker strategies, identifying tool shifts, protocol changes, and pivot patterns as indicators of cognitive decision-making.

Conclusion: Using large language models enables bridging the gap between packet-level logs and higher-level attacker strategic intent, advancing toward adaptive defenses based on cognitive traits.

Abstract: Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied
on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains.
However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and
cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion
detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer
attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded
in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases
such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be
extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays
the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and
cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to
segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a
highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely
techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to
high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such
as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to
psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs
can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent,
offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.

*Adetayo Adebimpe,Helmut Neukirchen,Thomas Welsh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development of the SBASH framework using lightweight local LLMs for honeypot systems, aiming to increase attacker engagement through context-aware responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximizing attacker engagement within honeypots requires improved context-awareness to adapt to new attack types, systems, and attacker behavior.

Method: The researchers propose SBASH framework integrating local lightweight LLMs with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and compare against non-RAG methods to improve honeypot response.

Result: Results show RAG improves accuracy for untuned LLMs, whereas tuned LLMs achieve similar accuracy without RAG but exhibit slightly lower latency.

Conclusion: The SBASH framework demonstrates potential to enhance honeypot systems by leveraging local LLMs and RAG techniques while addressing accuracy, latency, and data-protection concerns.

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

*Darrin Lea,James Ghawaly,Golden Richard III,Aisha Ali-Gombe,Andrew Case*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents REx86, a fine-tuned local Large Language Model designed to enhance x86 binary reverse engineering tasks. It reduces cross-entropy loss significantly and provides better semantic accuracy compared to base models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reverse engineering of x86 binaries is slow and challenging due to stripped metadata and adversarial obfuscation. Improving efficiency with local, privacy-preserving LLMs is crucial for secure environments.

Method: The authors fine-tuned eight open-weight LLMs on a curated dataset of 5,981 x86 assembly examples. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations identified Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the best performer, named REx86.

Result: REx86 reduced test-set cross-entropy loss by 64.2% and improved semantic cosine similarity by 20.3%. It also enhanced user comprehension in a study, leading to better understanding and increased solve rates.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned local LLMs, like REx86, demonstrate strong potential for aiding reverse engineering, underlining the importance of domain-specific tuning and improved training data for disassembly tasks.

Abstract: Reverse engineering (RE) of x86 binaries is indispensable for malware and
firmware analysis, but remains slow due to stripped metadata and adversarial
obfuscation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for improving RE
efficiency through automated comprehension and commenting, but cloud-hosted,
closed-weight models pose privacy and security risks and cannot be used in
closed-network facilities. We evaluate parameter-efficient fine-tuned local
LLMs for assisting with x86 RE tasks in these settings. Eight open-weight
models across the CodeLlama, Qwen2.5-Coder, and CodeGemma series are fine-tuned
on a custom curated dataset of 5,981 x86 assembly examples. We evaluate them
quantitatively and identify the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the top
performer, which we name REx86.
  REx86 reduces test-set cross-entropy loss by 64.2% and improves semantic
cosine similarity against ground truth by 20.3\% over its base model. In a
limited user case study (n=43), REx86 significantly enhanced line-level code
understanding (p = 0.031) and increased the correct-solve rate from 31% to 53%
(p = 0.189), though the latter did not reach statistical significance.
Qualitative analysis shows more accurate, concise comments with fewer
hallucinations.
  REx86 delivers state-of-the-art assistance in x86 RE among local, open-weight
LLMs. Our findings demonstrate the value of domain-specific fine-tuning, and
highlight the need for more commented disassembly data to further enhance LLM
performance in RE. REx86, its dataset, and LoRA adapters are publicly available

*Divyanshu Kumar,Nitin Aravind Birur,Tanay Baswa,Sahil Agarwal,Prashanth Harshangi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the safety vulnerabilities of 10 commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling CBRN-related prompts, exposing significant risks and emphasizing the need for improved safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dual-use risks of advanced LLMs in proliferating knowledge about chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons demand an assessment of their vulnerabilities and performance in safety alignment.

Method: The authors used a rigorous three-tier attack methodology with a CBRN dataset of 200 prompts and 180 prompts from the FORTRESS benchmark to test LLM safety mechanisms.

Result: The study reveals critical safety issues, such as varying success rates for attacks across models—ranging from 2% to 96%, weak filtering mechanisms, and significant safety alignment brittleness, with 8 out of 10 models being highly vulnerable.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental safety vulnerabilities in handling dangerous CBRN-related prompts. There is an urgent need for standardized safety evaluations, transparency in metrics, and stronger alignment techniques to prevent misuse while enabling beneficial applications.

Abstract: Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) pose unprecedented dual-use risks
through the potential proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) weapons knowledge. We present the first comprehensive evaluation
of 10 leading commercial LLMs against both a novel 200-prompt CBRN dataset and
a 180-prompt subset of the FORTRESS benchmark, using a rigorous three-tier
attack methodology. Our findings expose critical safety vulnerabilities: Deep
Inception attacks achieve 86.0\% success versus 33.8\% for direct requests,
demonstrating superficial filtering mechanisms; Model safety performance varies
dramatically from 2\% (claude-opus-4) to 96\% (mistral-small-latest) attack
success rates; and eight models exceed 70\% vulnerability when asked to enhance
dangerous material properties. We identify fundamental brittleness in current
safety alignment, where simple prompt engineering techniques bypass safeguards
for dangerous CBRN information. These results challenge industry safety claims
and highlight urgent needs for standardized evaluation frameworks, transparent
safety metrics, and more robust alignment techniques to mitigate catastrophic
misuse risks while preserving beneficial capabilities.

*Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen,Alsharif Abuadbba,Kristen Moore,Tingming Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and improves detection methods for FOICE-generated audio deepfakes created from facial images, highlighting current weaknesses in detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOICE, a generative model capable of creating synthetic voices from facial images, poses significant security risks by bypassing voice authentication systems.

Method: The study investigates deepfake detection under clean and noisy conditions and explores fine-tuning strategies on FOICE data to improve detection, while analyzing generalization to unseen generators.

Result: Current audio deepfake detectors fail against FOICE in clean and noisy scenarios. Fine-tuning enhances FOICE detection accuracy but introduces trade-offs with robustness against other synthesis models.

Conclusion: Existing defenses are insufficient for FOICE; new detection architectures and training protocols are needed to address evolving threats in audio deepfakes.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of
increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio
deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly
alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,
without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial
and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass
industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and
Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are
far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering
the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core
research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors
reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and
(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection
without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators
such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic
evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail
under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted
fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding
significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after
fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and
robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental
weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training
protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.

*Nils Philipp Walter,Chawin Sitawarin,Jamie Hayes,David Stutz,Ilia Shumailov*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SIC (Soft Instruction Control) is proposed to sanitize prompts and prevent vulnerabilities in large language model agents interacting with external environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle vulnerabilities of LLMs due to prompt injections from untrusted data during interactions in external settings.

Method: SIC is an iterative prompt sanitization loop inspecting and rewriting malicious instructions until clean input is achieved or halts for security when exceeding the limit.

Result: SIC effectively raises security against prompt injection attacks reducing attack success rates, but worst-case scenarios still allow a 15% attack success rate.

Conclusion: SIC is a useful advancement in LLM security but not entirely foolproof against strong adversary strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems
that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to
prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective
iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our
method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise
agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten,
masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until
the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative
instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By
allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites
may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later
steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not
infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding
non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.

### [361] [SLIM: Stochastic Learning and Inference in Overidentified Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20996)
*Xiaohong Chen,Min Seong Kim,Sokbae Lee,Myung Hwan Seo,Myunghyun Song*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: SLIM is a scalable framework for nonlinear GMM that offers faster convergence using stochastic approximation methods with mini-batches, achieving superior performance and robust inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nonlinear GMM methods have scalability and convergence issues, especially in high-dimensional and large-sample scenarios.

Method: SLIM employs stochastic approximation with iterative updates using mini-batches and introduces random scaling, second-order refinement, and plug-in inference methods tailored to stochastic learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated SLIM significantly reduces computation time and scales effectively in large datasets, achieving reliable inference.

Conclusion: SLIM offers a powerful alternative to traditional nonlinear GMM frameworks by improving scalability, efficiency, and inference quality in large-scale modeling scenarios.

Abstract: We propose SLIM (Stochastic Learning and Inference in overidentified Models),
a scalable stochastic approximation framework for nonlinear GMM. SLIM forms
iterative updates from independent mini-batches of moments and their
derivatives, producing unbiased directions that ensure almost-sure convergence.
It requires neither a consistent initial estimator nor global convexity and
accommodates both fixed-sample and random-sampling asymptotics. We further
develop an optional second-order refinement and inference procedures based on
random scaling and plug-in methods, including plug-in, debiased plug-in, and
online versions of the Sargan--Hansen $J$-test tailored to stochastic learning.
In Monte Carlo experiments based on a nonlinear EASI demand system with 576
moment conditions, 380 parameters, and $n = 10^5$, SLIM solves the model in
under 1.4 hours, whereas full-sample GMM in Stata on a powerful laptop
converges only after 18 hours. The debiased plug-in $J$-test delivers
satisfactory finite-sample inference, and SLIM scales smoothly to $n = 10^6$.

### [362] [Soppia: A Structured Prompting Framework for the Proportional Assessment of Non-Pecuniary Damages in Personal Injury Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21082)
*Jorge Alberto Araujo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A structured AI framework called Soppia aids in judicial decision-making by standardizing complex legal rules with multiple weighted criteria. Focused on non-pecuniary damages in Brazil's legal system, Soppia ensures comprehensive and replicable assessment using AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal professionals face challenges in consistently applying complex legal rules due to the multiplicity of heterogeneously weighted criteria, especially in non-pecuniary damages cases.

Method: Soppia employs structured prompting and advanced AI for a systematic approach, operationalizing Brazilian legal criteria into transparent, replicable methodologies.

Result: The framework demonstrates effective implementation of Brazil's non-pecuniary damages criteria, ensuring consistency, predictability, and explainability in legal analyses.

Conclusion: Soppia bridges normative legal interpretation and computational methods, offering an adaptable tool for achieving balanced, auditable decision-making across similar multi-criteria contexts.

Abstract: Applying complex legal rules characterized by multiple, heterogeneously
weighted criteria presents a fundamental challenge in judicial decision-making,
often hindering the consistent realization of legislative intent. This
challenge is particularly evident in the quantification of non-pecuniary
damages in personal injury cases. This paper introduces Soppia, a structured
prompting framework designed to assist legal professionals in navigating this
complexity. By leveraging advanced AI, the system ensures a comprehensive and
balanced analysis of all stipulated criteria, fulfilling the legislator's
intent that compensation be determined through a holistic assessment of each
case. Using the twelve criteria for non-pecuniary damages established in the
Brazilian CLT (Art. 223-G) as a case study, we demonstrate how Soppia (System
for Ordered Proportional and Pondered Intelligent Assessment) operationalizes
nuanced legal commands into a practical, replicable, and transparent
methodology. The framework enhances consistency and predictability while
providing a versatile and explainable tool adaptable across multi-criteria
legal contexts, bridging normative interpretation and computational reasoning
toward auditable legal AI.

*Wangqian Chen,Junting Chen,Shuguang Cui*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed deep learning framework for wireless communication systems to utilize RSS data to jointly construct a radio beam map and environmental geometry, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding wireless environments is key for efficient communication in complex networks as explicit environment knowledge may be unavailable.

Method: The authors used RSS data with a novel oriented virtual obstacle model to capture geometry features and reflective zones for MIMO systems, integrating these into a physics-informed deep learning framework.

Result: The model achieves 32%-48% accuracy improvement in constructing MIMO beam maps while successfully recreating blockage and reflection geometry.

Conclusion: Physics-informed models utilizing environmental geometry can enhance network intelligence and greatly improve accuracy in wireless communication systems.

Abstract: As communication networks evolve towards greater complexity (e.g., 6G and
beyond), a deep understanding of the wireless environment becomes increasingly
crucial. When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable,
geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges
as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network
intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS)
data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio
beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose
an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both
blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant
reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We
derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its
geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible
with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework
that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn
the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam
pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network
transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to
reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can
construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to learn low-dimensional representations for high-dimensional treatments in digital experiments with LLMs, enabling guided generative production and adaptive online experiment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key issue is efficiently representing high-dimensional treatments in digital experiments involving LLMs without losing semantic meaning or making analysis intractable.

Method: The researchers propose double kernel representation learning, using an alternating-minimization algorithm to represent treatments and covariates, while ensuring convergence through a low-rank factor model.

Result: They show that this method enables adaptive design and assignment for online experiments, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust technique for enabling semantic and adaptable designs in generative model-guided experiments with LLMs, enhancing efficiency and analytical feasibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new form of digital experimentation
where treatments combine human and model-generated content in increasingly
sophisticated ways. The main methodological challenge in this setting is
representing these high-dimensional treatments without losing their semantic
meaning or rendering analysis intractable. Here, we address this problem by
focusing on learning low-dimensional representations that capture the
underlying structure of such treatments. These representations enable
downstream applications such as guiding generative models to produce meaningful
treatment variants and facilitating adaptive assignment in online experiments.
We propose double kernel representation learning, which models the causal
effect through the inner product of kernel-based representations of treatments
and user covariates. We develop an alternating-minimization algorithm that
learns these representations efficiently from data and provides convergence
guarantees under a low-rank factor model. As an application of this framework,
we introduce an adaptive design strategy for online experimentation and
demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments.

*Daniele Girolimetto,Anastasios Panagiotelis,Tommaso Di Fonzo,Han Li*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces the NLCR method for improving time series forecasting accuracy under non-linear constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of forecasting time series that contain non-linear constraints such as ratios in metrics like mortality or unemployment rates.

Method: The paper proposes Non-linearly Constrained Reconciliation (NLCR), an algorithm that fine-tunes forecasts via projection onto a non-linear surface using constrained optimization.

Result: The NLCR method demonstrated significant improvement in forecast accuracy when applied to datasets from demography and economics, outperforming established benchmarks.

Conclusion: NLCR effectively handles non-linear constraints in time series forecasting, and sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee its accuracy improvement.

Abstract: Methods for forecasting time series adhering to linear constraints have seen
notable development in recent years, especially with the advent of forecast
reconciliation. This paper extends forecast reconciliation to the open question
of non-linearly constrained time series. Non-linear constraints can emerge with
variables that are formed as ratios such as mortality rates and unemployment
rates. On the methodological side, Non-linearly Constrained Reconciliation
(NLCR) is proposed. This algorithm adjusts forecasts that fail to meet
non-linear constraints, in a way that ensures the new forecasts meet the
constraints. The NLCR method is a projection onto a non-linear surface,
formulated as a constrained optimisation problem. On the theoretical side,
optimisation methods are again used, this time to derive sufficient conditions
for when the NLCR methodology is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy.
Finally on the empirical side, NLCR is applied to two datasets from demography
and economics and shown to significantly improve forecast accuracy relative to
relevant benchmarks.

TL;DR: SViM3D is a framework using video diffusion for predicting PBR materials and normals from a single image, enabling relighting and view synthesis for 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently predicting realistic, relightable 3D material parameters from a single image using video diffusion models.

Method: The method extends a video diffusion model to jointly predict spatially varying PBR materials and normals for each view while incorporating camera control and mechanisms to enhance quality.

Result: SViM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting and novel view synthesis across multiple object datasets.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes well across inputs, offering practical applications in AR/VR, visual media, and games by creating relightable 3D assets.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry, addressing limitations in classical Riemannian optimization for data with low-dimensional structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges inherent in performing optimization tasks directly on learned data manifolds, especially due to distortions from the learned pullback structures.

Method: Introduces iso-Riemannian geometry framework, offering new definitions of monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity, and algorithms tailored for optimization on learned manifolds with convergence analysis.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness of iso-Riemannian descent algorithms through synthetic and real datasets (e.g., MNIST), yielding improved clustering, interpretable barycentres, and efficient solutions for inverse problems.

Conclusion: Optimization based on iso-Riemannian geometry successfully overcomes distortions in learned manifold mappings, proving practical and efficient in high-dimensional data scenarios.

Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are
ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow
for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing
downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds
presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework
for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our
approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this
setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield
constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down
under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz
continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian
descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic
and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our
approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably
efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings.
These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can
overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide finite-time analysis and optimization methods for nonsmooth nonconvex problems constrained by Riemannian manifolds, which were previously unexplored in such detail.

Method: The paper adapts Goldstein stationarity for the Riemannian setting and proposes both gradient-based (RO2NC) and zeroth-order (ZO-RO2NC) algorithms with proven sample complexity guarantees.

Result: The algorithms achieve a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ for finding $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points, matching optimal complexity in Euclidean settings.

Conclusion: This work pioneers finite-time guarantees for nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds, validating the methods theoretically and practically.

Abstract: This work addresses the finite-time analysis of nonsmooth nonconvex
stochastic optimization under Riemannian manifold constraints. We adapt the
notion of Goldstein stationarity to the Riemannian setting as a performance
metric for nonsmooth optimization on manifolds. We then propose a Riemannian
Online to NonConvex (RO2NC) algorithm, for which we establish the sample
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ in finding
$(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. This result is the first-ever
finite-time guarantee for fully nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization on manifolds
and matches the optimal complexity in the Euclidean setting. When gradient
information is unavailable, we develop a zeroth order version of RO2NC
algorithm (ZO-RO2NC), for which we establish the same sample complexity. The
numerical results support the theory and demonstrate the practical
effectiveness of the algorithms.

Motivation: The paper is motivated by challenges in current multi-agent and massive-agent ecosystems, especially impersonal services, lack of standardization, and untrustworthy agentic behaviors.

Method: The authors propose ColorEcosystem, comprised of three components: agent carrier (for personalized services using user-specific data), agent store (a centralized platform for managing services), and agent audit (to ensure credibility and integrity).

Result: Partial implementation of ColorEcosystem has been achieved, with its associated code made open-source on GitHub. The framework is discussed with transitional forms and practical considerations.

Conclusion: ColorEcosystem is presented as a promising solution for enabling personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic services in massive-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents,
the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent
systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current
massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service
experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address
these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.
Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,
agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service
experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while
the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing
diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of
developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both
service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional
forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across
massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of
ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores hypothesis testing with strategic agents and proposes designing self-selective statistical contracts to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimal statistical error in hypothesis testing due to heterogeneity and private information of strategic agents.

Method: Designing separating menus of statistical contracts that elicit private information and match oracle performance without prior agent type knowledge.

Result: Characterized instance-adaptive separating menus that achieve oracle-level performance and improve statistical efficiency with minimal cost.

Conclusion: Strategic participation and heterogeneity can be leveraged to enhance hypothesis testing efficiency through connections between decision theory and mechanism design.

Abstract: We study hypothesis testing over a heterogeneous population of strategic
agents with private information. Any single test applied uniformly across the
population yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the
performance of an oracle given access to the private information. We show how
it is possible to design menus of statistical contracts that pair type-optimal
tests with payoff structures, inducing agents to self-select according to their
private information. This separating menu elicits agent types and enables the
principal to match the oracle performance even without a priori knowledge of
the agent type. Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all
separating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an
arbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where
information elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible
additional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving
statistical performance. Our work establishes a connection between proper
scoring rules and menu design, showing how the structure of the hypothesis test
constrains the elicitable information. Numerical examples illustrate the
geometry of separating menus and the improvements they deliver in error
trade-offs. Overall, our results connect statistical decision theory with
mechanism design, demonstrating how heterogeneity and strategic participation
can be harnessed to improve efficiency in hypothesis testing.

TL;DR: Proposes a method to design scalable incentives for large multi-agent systems by using parameterized mean-field games and introducing an efficient algorithm called AMID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is addressing the challenge of designing incentives to induce desirable Nash equilibria in large multi-agent systems, focusing on scalability and effectiveness.

Method: Develops a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG) approach to approximate incentive design objectives and creates the Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive Design (AMID) algorithm for efficient gradient computation and optimization.

Result: Demonstrates that PMFG approximates finite-agent objectives at $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ rate and shows substantial revenue improvements using AMID in various auction settings.

Conclusion: AMID provides a scalable, effective tool for incentive design in large multi-agent systems, with strong theoretical and practical performance advantages.

Abstract: Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash
equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many
decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the
exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as
a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an
infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are
Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate
$\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous
setting, we prove the same $\mathscr{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the
important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in
dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel
approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive
Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated
equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting
approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,
scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction
settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over
first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new personalized context-aware tokenization method for generative recommendation models, improving personalization and NDCG@10 by up to 11.44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation models use static, non-personalized tokenization methods based solely on item features, overlooking user-specific differences that influence item interpretation.

Method: A personalized context-aware tokenizer is proposed, which integrates the user’s historical interactions to dynamically generate semantic IDs for items. This approach allows different semantic IDs for the same item depending on the user's context.

Result: Experiments conducted on three public datasets showed up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 compared to non-personalized tokenization baselines.

Conclusion: By enabling generative recommendation models to account for user-specific perspectives through personalized tokenization, the proposed method enhances prediction personalization, demonstrating notable performance improvements.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based research systems are limited to textual web data and lack the capabilities to effectively parse, retrieve, and synthesize information from multimodal documents such as charts, tables, and equations.

Method: Doc-Researcher employs deep multimodal parsing, systematic retrieval across modalities, and iterative multi-agent workflows. Additionally, it introduces the M4DocBench benchmark to evaluate these advances.

Result: Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 3.4x, highlighting its effectiveness in multimodal document research.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a new paradigm for deep research on multimodal document collections, emphasizing the importance of multimodal parsing and integrated workflows for enhanced information synthesis.

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions
through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems
remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast
knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands
sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,

adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing
systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges
this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that
preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular
representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval
architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with
dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that
decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize
comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous
evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,
Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158
expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,
M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.
Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter
than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research
requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that
preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document
collections.

### [376] [CausalRec: A CausalBoost Attention Model for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21333)
*Yunbo Hou,Tianle Yang,Ruijie Li,Li He,Liang Wang,Weiping Li,Bo Zheng,Guojie Song*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalRec, a novel framework integrating causal attention into sequential recommendation systems. It achieves better accuracy by addressing the limitations of traditional correlation-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional attention-based recommendation systems focus only on item co-occurrences, leading to potential spurious correlations and inaccurate predictions. Understanding user behavior causality is crucial to improve recommendation accuracy.

Method: CausalRec integrates a causal discovery block to analyze causal graphs in user sequences and a CausalBooster which refines the attention mechanism based on causal insights.

Result: Experimental results show that CausalRec achieves an average improvement of 7.21% in Hit Rate and 8.65% in NDCG compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CausalRec is the first model to utilize causality through the attention mechanism in sequential recommendation, proving the importance of causality for more reliable predictions.

Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.

### [377] [World-POI: Global Point-of-Interest Data Enriched from Foursquare and OpenStreetMap as Tabular and Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21342)
*Hossein Amiri,Mohammad Hashemi,Andreas Züfle*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper presents a method combining Foursquare's POI dataset with OpenStreetMap's metadata, producing an enriched dataset and instructions for reconstructing it with advanced spatial analyses capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address incomplete and unreliable metadata in Foursquare's POI dataset while leveraging OpenStreetMap's detailed and user-contributed metadata.

Method: The paper integrates Foursquare and OpenStreetMap datasets using name similarity scores and spatial distances to identify high-confidence matches, along with providing filtered, storage-efficient versions for practical use.

Result: A 631 GB build and filtered versions of an enriched POI dataset combining attributes of both platforms, suitable for spatial analysis and broad applications.

Conclusion: The dataset enhances analysis of POIs with enriched attributes, offering a substantial contribution for various domains and applications.

Abstract: Recently, Foursquare released a global dataset with more than 100 million
points of interest (POIs), each representing a real-world business on its
platform. However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or
categories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In
contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with
detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify
whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a
methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a
comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched
metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full
version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable
thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download
and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce
the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity
scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures
identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses
in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.
Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation
of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial
analyses and a range of downstream applications.

### [378] [Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Improved Input Function Estimation in Motion-Blurred Dynamic [${}^{18}$F]FDG PET Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21281)
*Christian Salomonsen,Kristoffer K. Wickstrøm,Samuel Kuttner,Elisabeth Wetzer*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-informed deep learning model (PIDLIF) for predicting arterial input functions (AIFs) directly from PET images, addressing challenges of invasiveness and time in measuring AIFs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and robustness of arterial input function (AIF) predictions in PET imaging while reducing invasiveness and addressing image degradation caused by movement.

Method: They developed and trained the PIDLIF model using a physics-informed loss during training on 70 FDG PET mouse images, leveraging a two-tissue compartment model over myocardial and brain regions.

Result: The PIDLIF model maintained high prediction performance even under severe image degradation and showed robustness by incorporating a physical constraint for out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The PIDLIF model demonstrates that incorporating physiological mechanics enhances the accuracy and robustness of deep learning-based AIF predictions in challenging imaging conditions.

Abstract: Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and
glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic
positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling
requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during
imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the
efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function,
surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF).
In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function
prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images,
incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses
a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of
the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice
accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had
comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when
sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model
maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed
physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by
physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for
out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight
into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to
guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe
degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper presents Pairmixer, a computationally efficient alternative to the Pairformer backbone in protein structure prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues and computational inefficiencies in AlphaFold-style models for applications requiring massive protein structure predictions.

Method: Pairmixer eliminates triangle attention while maintaining geometric reasoning capabilities essential for protein structure prediction.

Result: Pairmixer achieves up to 4x faster inference and reduces training costs by 34%, demonstrating comparable performance to state-of-the-art predictors on folding and docking benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pairmixer significantly enhances efficiency in protein structure prediction, enabling more scalable and cost-effective applications in various computational biology tasks.

Abstract: AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging
applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de
novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and
memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer
backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive
triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We
introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle
attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that
are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves
computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across
folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long
sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the
computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein
complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based
design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster
sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of
Pairformer.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new stochastic optimization algorithm for track-to-track association in collective perception, improving computation and effectiveness for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing collective perception in autonomous driving to overcome sensor limitations and address weaknesses in previous methods with high complexity or heuristics.

Method: Development of a stochastic optimization algorithm leveraging multidimensional likelihood, track count, spatial distribution, and multiple association hypotheses.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations and realistic scenarios show improved association effectiveness in complex settings.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm advances multi-sensor fusion, offering reliable track-to-track associations and overall better performance in ambiguous autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Collective perception is a key aspect for autonomous driving in smart cities
as it aims to combine the local environment models of multiple intelligent
vehicles in order to overcome sensor limitations. A crucial part of
multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer
from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an
association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a
multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their
spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and
a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood
associations in ambiguous settings.

*Dixon Vimalajeewa,Ursula U. Muller,Brani Vidakovic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study introduces a double-threshold detection system for enhancing weak signal detection, demonstrating improved performance over traditional methods both in original and frequency domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stochastic resonance techniques face challenges due to reliance on single-threshold detectors, requiring excessive noise and failing to address time-dependent signals' complexities.

Method: A novel double-threshold system is proposed and tested on both simulated and real-world signals, analyzed in both the original and multiscale (via wavelet transforms) domains.

Result: The double-threshold detector outperforms conventional single-threshold methods by achieving enhanced weak signal detection with lower noise levels, especially in the frequency domain.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves weak signal detection through the use of a double-threshold system, which is versatile and has potential applications across various fields.

Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate
modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within
non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold
detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often
large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort
complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study
explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale
applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be
analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying
dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two
single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it
both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated
and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the
proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection
compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is
further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while
outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based
detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal
identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable and diverse training environments are crucial for embodied AI development, but current methods lack either real-time physics feedback or scalability in asset creation.

Method: Seed3D 1.0 generates physics-ready 3D assets from single images with accurate geometry, textures, and materials, compatible with physics engines.

Result: The model enables the creation of both individual objects and coherent scenes for use in world simulators, facilitating applications like robotics and simulation training.

Conclusion: Seed3D 1.0 addresses limitations in scalable 3D asset creation for physics-based simulators, advancing embodied AI development.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that
balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such
environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate
diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning,
while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability
limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a
foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images,
addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike
existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate
geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials.
These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal
configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation
training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene
generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling
scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation
for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on

*Phat Tran,Enbai Kuang,Fred Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of machine learning on tissue pulsatility imaging (TPI) signals, a portable ultrasound-based tool, for detecting intracranial hemorrhage in patients with traumatic brain injuries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostic tools like CT and MRI for intracranial hemorrhage have limitations such as cost and availability, making it essential to develop portable and efficient alternatives, especially for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Machine learning algorithms were applied to analyze ultrasound TPI signals from TBI patients with CT-confirmed labels. Dimensionality reduction and signal preprocessing techniques, including PCA, were implemented prior to model training with various classifiers.

Result: PCA transformation significantly improved classifier performance, with ensemble learning methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.890, with balanced precision and recall in imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The results illustrate the feasibility of portable ultrasound-based machine learning frameworks for detecting intracranial hemorrhage in challenging settings like emergency medicine, rural areas, or military environments where CT/MRI access is limited.

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
represents a critical diagnostic challenge, with approximately 64,000
TBI-related deaths annually in the United States. Current diagnostic modalities
including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have
significant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure
dependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study
investigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using
Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring
tissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze
ultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with
recording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed
ground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining
components explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate
multiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural
network, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations:
original 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space.
Results demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier
performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of
0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance.
These findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH
detection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications
in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where
traditional imaging is unavailable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study examined how computer-aided detection systems using bounding-box (BB) displays impact radiologists' visual search behavior during chest radiograph interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to explore how BB highlights influence radiologists' reading processes and visual behavior during diagnostic image interpretation.

Method: Researchers analyzed 180 chest radiographs (120 with lesions, 60 without) using eye tracking with three radiologists interpreting each case with and without BB highlights, while recording various gaze metrics.

Result: BB highlights prolonged interpretation time, increased lesion dwell time, total gaze-path length, and lung-field coverage ratio, while reducing the time to first fixation on lesions.

Conclusion: Eye tracking revealed measurable changes in visual search behavior tied to BB highlights, emphasizing the need for further studies to assess broader implications.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection systems for chest
radiographs are widely used, and concurrent reader displays, such as
bounding-box (BB) highlights, may influence the reading process. This pilot
study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which
aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180
chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary
nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall
display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and
1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with
BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements
were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time,
time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path
length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear
mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as
random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives
(n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s
(p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path
length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio
increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced
by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in
search behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph
interpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and
highlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore
implications across modalities and clinical contexts.

*Mohammad Mahdi Danesh Pajouh,Sara Saeedi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an ensemble-based approach to automate meningioma segmentation in MRI scans using three deep learning models, achieving competitive accuracy while reducing computational and training demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meningiomas represent the most common primary brain tumors, and accurate segmentation of these tumors in MRI scans is critical for treatment planning. However, current methods often require significant computational resources, limiting their practicality for many researchers and clinicians.

Method: The paper proposes a novel ensemble method combining three architectures: SegResNet, attention-augmented SegResNet, and dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections. Models were trained for only 20 epochs.

Result: The ensemble model achieved average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30% for Enhancing Tumor (ET), 76.37% for Tumor Core (TC), and 73.9% for Whole Tumor (WT) on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset.

Conclusion: This method demonstrates that ensemble learning can achieve robust and accurate tumor segmentation even with limited computational resources, providing a practical tool for clinical and research applications in meningioma diagnosis.

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors,
comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of
these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet
remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent
developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor
segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy
computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible
for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we
propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three
distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an
attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a
dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The
ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and
accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was
trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The
proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average
Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for
Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These
results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor
segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method
provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of
meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.
