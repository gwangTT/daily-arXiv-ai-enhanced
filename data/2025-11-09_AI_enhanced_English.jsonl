Recent observations suggest that the internal\nactivations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,\nonly part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity\ncould reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,\nwhich remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained\nhardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of\ntechniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.\nThe method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes\nweights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory\nlocality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully\nutilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that\ngathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and\nhardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding\nthroughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,\nshowing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on\ncommodity GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes techniques to make large language models (LLMs) efficient on resource-constrained devices by combining dynamic sparsity and low-bit quantization for faster execution without losing accuracy.", "motivation": "Deploying LLMs on edge devices like mobile phones and desktops is vital for privacy, cost efficiency, and responsiveness, but hardware limitations in memory and compute capability make this challenging.", "method": "The paper introduces techniques including a zigzag-patterned quantization layout, a specialized GEMV kernel for optimizing computing resources, and a runtime mechanism to process sparse indices efficiently.", "result": "The proposed method achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput with accuracy similar to dense quantized models across multiple hardware setups and model sizes.", "conclusion": "Dynamic sparsity and low-bit quantization can be effectively combined to optimize LLMs for deployment on edge devices, overcoming hardware constraints while retaining performance."}}

We then validated the\nrepresentativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the\nDSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three\noptimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction\nperformance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to\n75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty\nin measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and\nimproves with the number of sensors deployed.

Existing\nevaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to\ncapture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge\napproaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper\nintroduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for\nthe rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an\nagentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)\ndatasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to\nensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge\nmetrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to\nachieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to\nevaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military\noperations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is\nhighly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter\nconfiguration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis\non the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG.
