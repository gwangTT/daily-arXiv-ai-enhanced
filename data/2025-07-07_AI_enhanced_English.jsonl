At the receiver,\nzero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for\nunseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational\noverhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the\nclassification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our\nevaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians\noutperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency\ndetails like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular\nreflections.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes HyperGaussians, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for generating high-quality animatable face avatars from videos, outperforming existing methods in realism and detail.", "motivation": "The motivation is to overcome challenges in creating realistic, animatable 3D face avatars from monocular videos, which are crucial for applications in augmented and virtual reality.
