However, the conflict problem between classes is\ndifficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem\nthrough prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of\nhard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we\npropose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which\nconsists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning\nmodule. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability\nthat the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the\nprototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing\nprototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different\ntransformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples\nrespectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic\ninformation and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable\nguarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five\ndatasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA.

In this paper, we propose a\nBidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small\ntarget Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy\nsimultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.\nSpecifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design\na Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal\ndependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the\nbidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head\nfor detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the\ntraditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)\nloss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference\nspeed.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a method, BIRD, for detecting small moving infrared targets in videos, utilizing both local and global temporal information for improved performance and efficiency.", "motivation": "Existing methods in moving infrared small target detection use sliding windows for temporal data aggregation but lack consideration of entire video optimization and global temporal information.", "method": "The BIRD approach uses bidirectional temporal propagation, combining both local (via LTMF) and global (via GTMF) temporal motion fusion.

While recent\nretrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space\nfor similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails\nto capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations\nintrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a\nhyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein\npockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the\nexponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek\nenables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model\nboth global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in\nchallenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands\nexhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity\nranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower\narchitecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early\nenrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and\naffinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),\ndemonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and\nhighlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand\nmodeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes HypSeek, a hyperbolic representation learning framework enhancing protein-ligand binding prediction for drug discovery, significantly improving virtual screening and affinity ranking performance.", "motivation": "Current protein-ligand binding prediction methods struggle with modeling hierarchical structures and fine-grained molecular interaction variations using Euclidean embeddings.", "method": "HypSeek embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, leveraging its negative curvature and geometry while employing a protein-guided three-tower architecture.", "result": "HypSeek improves performance on DUD-E virtual screening (+20.7%) and JACS affinity ranking correlation (+25.4%), showcasing hyperbolic geometry's modeling advantages.", "conclusion": "Hyperbolic geometry is a beneficial inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling, unifying affinity ranking and virtual screening in a single framework with enhanced accuracy."}}
