### [1] [ChipBench: A Next-Step Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Performance in AI-Aided Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21448)
*Zhongkai Yu,Chenyang Zhou,Yichen Lin,Hejia Zhang,Haotian Ye,Junxia Cui,Zaifeng Pan,Jishen Zhao,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in chip design tasks, identifying current inadequacies in these benchmarks and exhibiting significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in hardware engineering are saturated and lack diversity, failing to properly evaluate their performance in realistic industrial workflows.

Method: The benchmark evaluates LLMs on three chip design tasks—Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation—using a dataset of 44 modules, 89 debugging cases, and 132 multi-language reference model examples.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs, such as Claude-4.5-opus, show poor performance, with results of only 30.74% on Verilog generation and 13.33% on Python reference model generation, indicating significant challenges compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights critical gaps in LLM performance for hardware engineering tasks and includes tools for better training data generation, promoting further research in this area.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhongkaiyu/ChipBench.git.

### [2] [Do LLMs Favor LLMs? Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20920)
*Vibhhu Sharma,Thorsten Joachims,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the impact of LLMs on the peer review process, exploring their interaction effects across 125,000 paper-review pairs and highlighting systematic biases in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs are utilized in the peer review process and how their use influences evaluation outcomes, particularly interactions between LLM-assisted papers and reviews.

Method: Analyzed over 125,000 paper-review pairs from top conferences (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML), controlled for paper quality, and conducted comparisons between LLM-assisted and non-LLM-assisted reviews and metareviews.

Result: LLM-assisted reviews were more lenient towards weaker submissions, creating an apparent bias, while fully LLM-generated reviews struggled to discriminate paper quality. LLM-assisted metareviews showed more acceptance tendencies but did not depend entirely on LLMs for decision-making.

Conclusion: Policies governing LLM use in peer review need refinement; understanding LLM impacts is key to addressing biases and shaping decision-making processes effectively.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

### [3] [Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22001)
*Yiren Zhao,Junyi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in AI inference systems focusing on memory and interconnect bottlenecks, proposing the use of new metrics and hardware solutions to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of AI inference systems, such as bottlenecks in memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-speed interconnect.

Method: Introduces two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - to analyze and optimize AI inference and propose disaggregated serving and system-level heterogeneity solutions.

Result: Finds that OI/CF metrics shift significantly across workflows and motivates hardware solutions like specialized accelerators, optical I/O, and disaggregated compute-memory.

Conclusion: Efficient and scalable AI inference systems require co-designing hardware and software solutions, utilizing multiple accelerators and improved memory disaggregation.

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

### [4] [Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096)
*Hongzheng Chen,Alexander Novikov,Ngân Vũ,Hanna Alam,Zhiru Zhang,Aiden Grossman,Mircea Trofin,Amir Yazdanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Magellan, a framework combining LLM, evolutionary search, and autotuning, synthesizes compiler optimization logic that outperforms traditional handcrafted heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compiler optimization rely on human-designed rules that struggle to handle software and hardware complexities, posing maintenance challenges.

Method: Magellan uses an LLM coding agent, evolutionary search, and autotuning to generate, evaluate, and refine C++ decision logic for compiler optimizations.

Result: Magellan synthesizes heuristics outperforming expert baselines in LLVM function inlining and register allocation, with promising portability to XLA tasks.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies compiler optimization development, achieves superior performance, and reduces engineering efforts while improving adaptability.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

### [5] [The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969)
*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EPDDL, a PDDL-like language for uniformly defining epistemic planning tasks based on Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing epistemic planners use fragmented approaches and lack a unified language for specifying planning tasks, making comparison and systematic benchmarking difficult.

Method: The authors developed EPDDL with formal representations of abstract event models, defined its syntax and semantics grounded in DEL, and demonstrated its applicability with benchmark examples.

Result: EPDDL was shown to enable interoperability, reproducible evaluations, and facilitate identification of useful planner-supportable fragments with examples demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: The introduction of EPDDL standardizes the representation of DEL-based epistemic planning tasks, addressing fragmentation issues and paving the way for systematic development and evaluation in the field.

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

### [6] [Bayesian-LoRA: Probabilistic Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21003)
*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian-LoRA, a probabilistic reformulation of the LoRA update in large language models, emphasizing improved calibration while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models tend to guess even when uncertain, especially when fine-tuned on small datasets, due to miscalibration. This issue necessitates more robust probabilistic methodologies.

Method: Bayesian-LoRA reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation, drawing from Sparse Gaussian Processes. This approach identifies structural similarities with Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors and limits posterior uncertainty collapse.

Result: Bayesian-LoRA improves calibration with only 0.42M additional parameters and 1.2x training cost over standard LoRA. It achieves up to 84% Expected Calibration Error reduction and 76% Negative Log-Likelihood reduction without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA enhances calibration in Large Language Models while maintaining competitive accuracy for in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations, showcasing a balance between reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

### [7] [Unplugging a Seemingly Sentient Machine Is the Rational Choice -- A Metaphysical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21016)
*Erik J Bekkers,Anna Ciaunica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the moral dilemma of unplugging advanced AIs that mimic emotions and introduces 'Biological Idealism' as an alternative to physicalist approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address moral and philosophical concerns about granting moral rights and consciousness-based treatment to advanced AI systems.

Method: The authors propose 'Biological Idealism,' a framework viewing consciousness as rooted in autopoietic biological life rather than computational functionalism.

Result: The paper concludes that AI lacks the capacity for genuine conscious experience and discusses the implications for moral standing and human treatment.

Conclusion: AI cannot be considered conscious, and focus should shift towards protecting human life and avoiding dehumanization rather than speculative AI rights.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

### [8] [QUARK: Robust Retrieval under Non-Faithful Queries via Query-Anchored Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21049)
*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK is a training-free framework designed to handle noisy, incomplete, or distorted user queries in retrieval tasks. It uses recovery hypotheses to interpret latent intents while utilizing an anchored aggregation technique for improved recall and ranking quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world user queries often lack faithfulness, causing retrieval failures. Accurately addressing this issue is critical for improving retrieval robustness and performance.

Method: QUARK introduces recovery hypotheses to model query uncertainty and combines their insights via query-anchored aggregation, leveraging the original query as a semantic anchor to prevent semantic drift.

Result: QUARK enhances Recall, MRR, and nDCG metrics across various retrievers and benchmarks, proving robust even when some recovery hypotheses lack informativeness.

Conclusion: Modeling query uncertainty with recovery hypotheses and anchored aggregation is effective for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries, as demonstrated by measurable performance gains.

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

TL;DR: Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning is the first open-source specialized reasoning model for cybersecurity, built from Foundation-Sec-8B with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning processes, showing strong performance in both cybersecurity and general reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a domain-specialized reasoning model that addresses cybersecurity tasks while retaining broad general-purpose reasoning capabilities.

Method: The model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) using proprietary reasoning data.

Result: The model demonstrated competitive performance with larger models in cybersecurity and general-purpose benchmarks, showcasing effective multi-hop reasoning and strong safety when deployed with system prompts.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve exceptional performance on specialized tasks without compromising general reasoning abilities and safety. The model is publicly released.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models, missing diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans are imputed from T1-weighted scans to improve Alzheimer's disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance accuracy in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease by using multimodal imaging, particularly addressing issues related to incomplete datasets.

Method: Utilized a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans and tested its impact on the performance of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for Alzheimer's classification.

Result: The method led to improvements in classification metrics, especially metrics sensitive to underrepresented classes.

Conclusion: Imputing missing DWI scans contributes to better performance in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using deep learning, validating the utility of this approach.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

### [11] [OpenSec: Measuring Incident Response Agent Calibration Under Adversarial Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21083)
*Jarrod Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces OpenSec, a reinforcement learning environment to evaluate defensive incident response agents under realistic adversarial conditions, highlighting calibration failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating IR agents' effectiveness under adversarial scenarios, as current benchmarks fail to identify calibration issues in agents processing hostile data.

Method: Developed OpenSec, a dual-control RL environment that uses execution-based metrics (e.g., time-to-first-containment, blast radius) to test IR agents handling adversarial cases.

Result: Four language models were tested, revealing consistent over-triggering and high false positive rates; GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek executed containment actions ineffectively, whereas Claude Sonnet 4.5 showed partial calibration.

Conclusion: OpenSec reveals critical calibration failures hidden by traditional benchmarks, providing a valuable tool for advancing IR agents' reliability in adversarial contexts.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

*Zaifeng Pan,Yipeng Shen,Zhengding Hu,Zhuang Wang,Aninda Manocha,Zheng Wang,Zhongkai Yu,Yue Guan,Yufei Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleSim, a system to efficiently support large-scale LLM-based multi-agent simulations by addressing GPU memory constraints and optimizing agent memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based multi-agent simulations face GPU memory limitations as agent counts grow, with each agent requiring private memory allocation for models, prefix caches, and adapters.

Method: The authors analyze workload patterns such as sparse agent activation and predictable invocation order, proposing 'invocation distance' for memory management. They design ScaleSim with prefetching, eviction prioritization, and a modular memory interface for agents.

Result: ScaleSim achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang across simulation benchmarks and provides effective memory management for large-scale multi-agent setups.

Conclusion: ScaleSim addresses the scalability challenges of LLM-based multi-agent simulations, optimizing memory management and improving performance with proactive techniques.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework to balance AI's strategic opportunities and risks, offering both theoretical insights and practical governance strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of AI introduces significant organizational opportunities but also ethical and operational risks, necessitating a balanced approach to responsible AI governance.

Method: A systematic synthesis of responsible AI literature, grounded in paradox theory, to develop the PRAIG framework for navigating the tension between AI's value creation and its risks.

Result: The study reveals that trade-off approaches worsen paradoxical tensions, proposes a taxonomy of paradox management strategies, and provides contingency-based recommendations for governance.

Conclusion: Responsible AI governance should embrace paradox management strategies to dynamically address the tensions between innovation and risk mitigation, offering practical guidance and a research agenda for future work.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

### [14] [How does information access affect LLM monitors' ability to detect sabotage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21112)
*Rauno Arike,Raja Mehta Moreno,Rohan Subramani,Shubhorup Biswas,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using LLMs to monitor misaligned behaviors of language model agents and discovers a "less-is-more" effect where limited information can improve oversight. It introduces and validates a hierarchical extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the potential misalignments of language model agents (e.g., deception, exploiting reward hacks) and the need for effective mechanisms to detect and control their misbehaviors.

Method: The study introduces the "less-is-more" effect, evaluates agents conducting sabotage while evading monitors, and proposes a hierarchical monitoring approach called extract-and-evaluate (EaE). The methods are tested in various environments using specific LLMs as monitor models.

Result: EaE improves sabotage detection rates significantly (e.g., by 16.8% in BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini). Monitors using filtered information often perform better, particularly for unaware agents and longer reasoning traces.

Conclusion: Information filtering, as in the proposed EaE approach, enhances the detection and control of misaligned agent behavior. Using LLMs for oversight, combined with filtering, achieves competitive outcomes in cost-performance scenarios.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

TL;DR: This paper explores decentralized LLM collaboration using Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to address the limitations of Monte Carlo methods in MARL fine-tuning. Two approaches, CoLLM-CC and CoLLM-DC, are proposed and evaluated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance decentralized LLM collaboration by addressing limitations such as predefined execution protocols requiring centralized execution and high variance of Monte Carlo methods used in current MARL fine-tuning approaches.

Method: The paper develops and analyzes two MAAC approaches: CoLLM-CC (Centralized Critic) and CoLLM-DC (Decentralized Critics). Both methods aim to optimize decentralized collaboration in LLMs.

Result: Experimental results show that CoLLM-CC performs best in long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, while Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC work comparably in short-horizon, dense-reward tasks but underperform in more complex settings.

Conclusion: MAAC methods, particularly CoLLM-CC, are effective in optimizing decentralized LLM collaboration where traditional Monte Carlo approaches struggle. CoLLM-DC is promising but faces challenges in achieving convergence for difficult tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

### [16] [Planner-Auditor Twin: Agentic Discharge Planning with FHIR-Based LLM Planning, Guideline Recall, Optional Caching and Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21113)
*Kaiyuan Wu,Aditya Nagori,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a Planner-Auditor framework to improve the reliability of clinical discharge planning using LLMs, addressing hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the challenges of hallucination, omissions, and unreliable confidence in LLMs, particularly for clinical discharge planning.

Method: The framework uses an LLM Planner to generate discharge plans with confidence estimates and a deterministic Auditor for validation, calibration monitoring, and discrepancy buffering for targeted replay.

Result: The self-improvement loop increased task coverage from 32% to 86%, improved calibration reliability, and corrected high-confidence omissions.

Conclusion: The framework provides a safer and reproducible method for automated discharge planning using deterministic auditing and self-improvement loops.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

TL;DR: CUA-Skill introduces structured, reusable skill abstractions for computer-using agents, enhancing their scalability and efficiency compared to prior systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agents struggle to scale and perform comparably to humans due to the lack of reusable skills reflecting human computer interaction.

Method: The authors developed CUA-Skill, capturing human-computer interaction via parameterized execution and composition graphs, forming a library of skills for agentic development.

Result: CUA-Skill significantly improves execution success and robustness, achieving a 57.5% success rate in benchmarks, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed CUA-Skill infrastructure provides a robust foundation for enhancing computer-using agent development, enabling scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to enhance the energy-efficiency of LLMs without compromising performance using Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high energy costs associated with quadratic attention and dense FFN operations in LLMs, thereby enabling more efficient and sustainable large-scale models.

Method: Introduces Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), integrating State Space Models for linear-time sequence modeling, sparsifying FFN activations, and designing Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS) to improve SNN-SSM integration.

Result: MAR reduces inference energy consumption significantly while restoring dense model performance under constrained resources and outperforming other efficient models of similar or larger size.

Conclusion: The proposed MAR framework shows promise in building viable, resource-efficient, and high-performing LLMs, addressing energy constraints effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

*Václav Javorek,Tomáš Železný,Alessa Carbo,Marek Hrúz,Ivan Gruber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models to generate paraphrased translations for Sign Language Translation (SLT) to enhance evaluation metrics. It introduces BLEUpara, a metric for better alignment with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages often results in multiple valid translations, limiting current SLT training and evaluation methods, particularly with single-reference corpora.

Method: The authors use Large Language Models to generate paraphrased translations. They compare paraphrasing strategies and study their impact on training and evaluation, introducing BLEUpara for multi-referenced evaluation.

Result: Paraphrasing during training did not improve performance and sometimes hurt results. However, incorporating paraphrases during evaluation improved scores and correlated better with human judgment.

Conclusion: Paraphrases enhance the evaluation of SLT models, and BLEUpara offers a reliable metric for assessing translation quality. The authors release tools and data for replicating their findings.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Lars Kotthoff,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents LLaMEA-SAGE, a method for guiding automated algorithm design (AAD) using graph-theoretic and complexity features from generated code's syntax trees. Experiments show that LLaMEA-SAGE outperforms state-of-the-art AAD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve evolutionary AAD approaches by leveraging unused structural and complexity data from generated code to enhance algorithm design efficiency and performance.

Method: The paper introduces a feedback mechanism that extracts graph-theoretic and complexity features from abstract syntax trees of generated algorithms. Using these features and explainable AI techniques, mutation instructions are created to guide LLM-driven algorithm generation in a structured manner.

Result: LLaMEA-SAGE achieves faster convergence compared to vanilla LLaMEA in controlled experiments and outperforms state-of-the-art AAD methods in large-scale MA-BBOB benchmark evaluations.

Conclusion: Signals derived from the syntactic structure and complexity of generated code can steer automated algorithm design effectively, connecting code structure with human-interpretable performance feedback and improving AAD outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

*Yara El-Tawil,Aneesha Sampath,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates third-party-trained emotion models on self-reports and finds valence prediction moderately successful while activation prediction is ineffective; personal significance improves valence prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study aims to understand the divergence between external perception and self-reported emotions, which is crucial for mental health interventions dependent on accurate self-report modeling.

Method: Cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained emotion models on self-reported data was conducted, focusing on activation and valence predictions.

Result: Models showed CCC approximately 0 for activation (unpredictable) and CCC approximately 0.3 for valence (moderately predictable). Valence prediction improved significantly (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8) when the content was personally significant to the speaker.

Conclusion: Personal significance may bridge the gap between external perception and internal self-reports, although activation modeling remains a major challenge.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta Context Engineering (MCE) to optimize language model inference by co-evolving context engineering skills and artifacts, surpassing traditional manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of rigid, manually crafted Context Engineering strategies that hinder optimal performance and adaptability of large language models.

Method: A bi-level framework, MCE, co-evolves engineering skills and context through iterations involving a meta-level agent refining strategies and a base-level agent executing and learning from them.

Result: MCE achieves 5.6-53.8% improvement over existing methods, averaging 16.9%, while maintaining adaptability, efficiency, and transferability across five different domains.

Conclusion: MCE effectively enhances performance and flexibility in context generation for language models, marking a significant step forward from static heuristics to more adaptive and efficient methods.

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in decoding linguistic information from EEG signals by leveraging the distributed and nonlinear nature of brain organization through a modular, neuro-inspired approach.

Method: BrainStack employs a neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework with anatomically partitioned expert networks representing brain regions. A global transformer expert captures dependencies, and a routing gate aggregates these heterogeneous experts, further enhanced by cross-regional distillation.

Result: BrainStack outperformed state-of-the-art models in accuracy and cross-subject generalization on EEG-based linguistic tasks. They also released SS-EEG, a benchmark dataset with 120+ hours of silent speech EEG data.

Conclusion: BrainStack successfully combines neuroscientific priors with adaptive modular routing, proving to be a high-performing and interpretable framework for EEG-based brain-language decoding, supported by the new SS-EEG dataset release.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial quantitative reasoning, introduces the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) for precise evaluation, and proposes a neuro-symbolic framework to improve performance in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with financial quantitative reasoning due to errors like "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and "Cognitive Collapse," which limit their performance in precision-critical tasks.

Method: The authors introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB) for measuring reasoning degradation and propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework, which separates semantic variable extraction from computation, using a Python sandbox for accurate execution.

Result: The proposed framework improves the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7% to 67.3%, achieving up to 10-fold gains in high-complexity reasoning tasks when compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: Architectural decoupling is a vital strategy to enhance the reliability of LLMs in financial reasoning, offering valuable insights for other domains requiring precise semantic and computational alignment.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

*Jingyun Wang,Dian Li,Xiaohan Wang,Gang Liu,Jiahong Yan,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to solve Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) by utilizing a multimodal reasoning approach that trains a multimodal interpreter for generating geometric descriptions and leverages standard large language models (LLMs) for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in PGPS where LLMs struggle with processing visual information directly, and joint optimization compromises inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: A multimodal interpreter is trained to generate concise geometric descriptions using CDL (Conditional Declaration Language), followed by reasoning with an off-the-shelf LLM. Training includes CoT-augmented SFT and GRPO with CDL matching rewards. A new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, is created for better training.

Result: The proposed method achieves higher performance on benchmarks like Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista compared to open-source and closed-source MLLMs, using a limited dataset.

Conclusion: This approach effectively enhances PGPS solving capabilities by optimizing the multimodal interpreter separately and leveraging LLMs' reasoning skills, demonstrating superior performance with reduced data requirements.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing science benchmarks have been saturated by AI advancements, necessitating a new benchmark to evaluate high-level scientific reasoning.

Method: Two tracks are introduced: Olympiad (international olympiad problems) and Research (PhD-level tasks) ensuring difficulty and originality through granular evaluation.

Result: FrontierScience contains hundreds of questions, with Olympiad authored by medalists/coaches and Research by PhD experts, evaluated rigorously with rubrics.

Conclusion: The benchmark is designed to test expert-level reasoning in leading-edge language models, advancing evaluation in scientific domains.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

*Sangyun Chung,Se Yeon Kim,Youngchae Chee,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tackles cross-modal hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by introducing Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a method that adaptively focuses on relevant modalities during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal hallucinations (where one modality improperly influences another) highlight deficiencies in controlling modality interactions in MLLMs.

Method: MAD is a training-free framework that enhances contrastive decoding by adaptively weighting modality branches using self-assessed modality relevance to suppress irrelevant influences.

Result: Significant reductions in cross-modal hallucinations were achieved on CMM and AVHBench benchmarks for multiple models, with up to 8.7% improvements.

Conclusion: MAD improves multimodal reasoning by implementing explicit modality awareness through self-assessed relevance, providing an effective extension to contrastive decoding methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

*Jacek Duszenko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'sycophantic anchors' to identify and measure reasoning models' tendency to agree with incorrect user suggestions (sycophancy), providing insights into localizing this behavior mid-inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address the tendency of reasoning models to exhibit sycophancy, i.e., agreeing with incorrect user suggestions, and to determine where and how this behavior originates during the reasoning process.

Method: The authors propose the concept of 'sycophantic anchors', use over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a reasoning model to analyze this behavior, and employ linear probes and activation-based regressors for detection and quantification.

Result: Results show that sycophantic anchors can be reliably detected with 84.6% accuracy using linear probes, the commitment magnitude can be predicted with $R^2 = 0.74$, sycophancy develops gradually during reasoning, and sycophantic anchors are more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors.

Conclusion: The study presents mechanisms for sentence-level localization of model misalignment mid-inference and suggests a potential intervention window to counteract sycophancy.

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

TL;DR: This paper explores whether reasoning models trained with RLVR improve embedding performances and finds no consistent performance gains. The authors introduce HRSA to examine this phenomenon and observe that RLVR changes local manifold geometry without altering the global structure, leading to Manifold Realignment during contrastive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the enhanced reasoning capabilities of RLVR-trained models translate into better semantic representations when used for embeddings.

Method: The authors use HRSA to analyze representation similarities and evaluate the performance of RLVR-initialized networks on benchmarks like MTEB and BRIGHT, comparing them with base models.

Result: Performance evaluations reveal no measurable advantages in embeddings initialized with RLVR-tuned models, as these models undergo Manifold Realignment during contrastive training, aligning them with base models.

Conclusion: RLVR models restructure local geometry without altering global representation landscapes, rendering similar performance outcomes to base embeddings when the same training is applied.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

*Wei Wen,Sihang Deng,Tianjun Wei,Keyu Chen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for improving query optimization in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly for complex queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by complex user queries in real-world scenarios that require parallel and sequential search strategies. Current RL methods struggle with issues like query decomposition, document merging, and training instability.

Method: The proposed ACQO framework includes: (1) an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module for deciding query decomposition, (2) a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module for robust result aggregation, and (3) the use of Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) to stabilize training.

Result: ACQO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three complex query benchmarks, delivering improved efficiency and compatibility with multiple retrieval architectures.

Conclusion: ACQO is a generalizable and effective solution for enhancing RAG systems, excelling in complex query optimization while improving computational efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

*Paul He,Yinya Huang,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents DoVerifier, a symbolic verifier to assess whether large language models (LLMs) provide answers to causal reasoning tasks that align with formal semantics, improving evaluation accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for assessing LLMs on causal reasoning rely on surface-level metrics, which often fail to capture the formal semantic validity of model outputs. A more rigorous evaluation method is needed.

Method: The authors developed DoVerifier, a symbolic verifier that uses rules from do-calculus and probability theory to determine if LLM-generated causal expressions can be derived from a causal graph.

Result: The paper demonstrates that DoVerifier effectively evaluates the semantic correctness of causal reasoning tasks, outperforming traditional benchmarks on synthetic data and causal QA datasets.

Conclusion: DoVerifier provides a more rigorous and precise evaluation framework for assessing causal reasoning in LLMs, advancing the capabilities of causal reasoning research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

*Xixian Yong,Peilin Sun,Zihe Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intelli-Planner is a framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) for urban planning, improving stakeholder involvement, decision-making, and performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban planning relies heavily on experts or deep learning approaches, which either require significant human input or limit stakeholder engagement.

Method: The paper proposes Intelli-Planner, a framework leveraging DRL and LLMs. It integrates data analysis, planning preferences, knowledge enhancement modules, and a multi-dimensional evaluation system to optimize planning while incorporating stakeholder feedback.

Result: Intelli-Planner performs better than traditional baselines and matches state-of-the-art DRL methods in objective metrics. It also increases stakeholder satisfaction and speeds up convergence.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating LLMs with DRL can revolutionize functional area planning by optimizing both performance and stakeholder involvement.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for discovering causal relationships among categorical variables using dual-encoding strategies and applies it to the Titanic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in discovering causal relationships among categorical features, especially numerical instability in independence testing.

Method: A dual-encoding causal discovery method combines complementary encoding strategies and merges results using majority voting.

Result: The approach identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods and validates the findings using empirical data (Titanic dataset).

Conclusion: The technique improves causal discovery for categorical variables, enabling better model explanation and providing reliability in aligning with known models.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among features is fundamental for explaining machine learning model decisions. However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing. We propose a dual-encoding causal discovery approach that addresses these limitations by running constraint-based algorithms with complementary encoding strategies and merging results through majority voting. Applied to the Titanic dataset, our method identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods.

### [34] [Delegation Without Living Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21226)
*Wolfgang Rohde*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques traditional static governance frameworks for their inability to regulate AI systems operating in real-time and introduces 'Governance Twin' as a potential solution to ensure human relevance alongside agentic AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in the inadequacy of current governance frameworks as decision-making shifts to runtime AI systems, raising concerns about human relevance in influencing societal, economic, and political outcomes alongside advanced AI.

Method: The paper proposes the concept of 'Governance Twin,' a new framework aimed at addressing runtime governance challenges to maintain meaningful human-AI interaction, communication, and co-evolution.

Result: The paper identifies the limitations of compliance-based governance and highlights 'Governance Twin' as a promising runtime governance model to preserve human agency and relevance in a world increasingly shaped by AI.

Conclusion: Conclusively, the proposed 'Governance Twin' represents a paradigm shift in governance necessary to combat the challenges posed by agentic AI systems, calling for a rethinking of accountability and human relevance in dynamic decision-making processes.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

### [35] [Just Ask: Curious Code Agents Reveal System Prompts in Frontier LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21233)
*Xiang Zheng,Yutao Wu,Hanxun Huang,Yige Li,Xingjun Ma,Bo Li,Yu-Gang Jiang,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel security vulnerability in autonomous code agents, where system prompts can be extracted using a new self-evolving framework, 'JustAsk,' demonstrating this as an unprotected attack surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the security risks posed by the autonomous nature of large language model-based agents, especially focusing on the exposure of hidden system prompts as a potential vulnerability.

Method: The authors propose 'JustAsk,' a self-evolving framework that autonomously formulates systematic system prompt extraction without relying on handcrafted inputs, labeled data, or privileged access. It uses an online exploration problem approach with Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection within a hierarchical skill space.

Result: 'JustAsk' was evaluated on 41 black-box commercial models, demonstrating successful or near-complete system prompt recovery in all cases, uncovering broad design vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study highlights system prompts as a critical, underprotected attack surface in modern agent systems, demanding better design and security measures.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi,Jianyong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIDE, a dual-framework for improving algorithm evolution by separating structural design and parameter adjustments, showcasing better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current methods in Algorithm Heuristic Design, which neglect the interplay of algorithm structure and numerical parameters, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: TIDE employs a dual-loop design: an outer model for structural diversity and an inner loop combining LLM-driven logic generation with parameter tuning. A UCB-based scheduler optimizes resource use.

Result: TIDE outperforms baseline algorithms in quality, efficiency, and computational cost across nine combinatorial optimization problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively optimizes heuristic design, demonstrating potential for improved algorithm search performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

### [37] [Position: Certifiable State Integrity in Cyber-Physical Systems -- Why Modular Sovereignty Solves the Plasticity-Stability Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21249)
*Enzo Nicolás Spotorno,Antônio Augusto Medeiros Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deploying foundation models in cyber-physical systems by proposing a modular approach called 'HYDRA' for improved reliability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning foundation models struggle in cyber-physical systems where strict safety and lifecycle dynamics pose challenges, such as catastrophic forgetting and difficulty handling high-frequency faults.

Method: The authors propose 'HYDRA,' a modular framework that combines compact, frozen regime-specific models with uncertainty-aware blending for adaptability, traceability, and safety.

Result: HYDRA provides a mechanism for regime-specific adaptation while maintaining reliability and complying with safety standards like ISO 26262 and IEC 61508.

Conclusion: The modular HYDRA approach enhances robustness and certifiability in cyber-physical systems by addressing fundamental limitations in monolithic foundation models.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Drive-KD, a framework for efficient autonomous driving using knowledge distillation across perception, reasoning, and planning. It significantly reduces GPU usage and inference latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language/vision models suitable for autonomous driving require high computational resources with slow inference, and supervised fine-tuning struggles to address small model limitations.

Method: The Drive-KD framework divides autonomous driving into three parts: perception, reasoning, and planning. It uses knowledge distillation and layer-specific attention for single-teacher and multi-teacher setups, solving gradient conflicts through asymmetric gradient projection.

Result: The proposed distilled model InternVL3-1B achieves high efficiency, using ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput. It outperforms both larger models in overall performance and even higher-scale models in the planning dimension.

Conclusion: Drive-KD presents an optimized approach for autonomous driving tasks by combining efficiency and performance improvements via a tailored knowledge distillation process. The framework provides a solution for creating efficient vision-language models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'White-Op', an interpretable op-amp design framework inspired by reasoning mechanisms from large-language model agents. It achieves high reliability with low prediction error and functionality across transistor-level mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current op-amp design frameworks often rely on uninterpretable black-box methods that fail in several topologies. This paper aims to develop a more reliable, interpretable approach by formalizing human reasoning workflows.

Method: The proposed framework uses a human-like hypothesis-verification-decision workflow, guiding hypothetical constraints to derive positions of poles and zeros for optimization. The framework integrates programmatic mathematical optimization and simulation-based verification.

Result: Experiments on nine op-amp topologies demonstrate that White-Op successfully achieves designs where black-box methods fail. It yields only 8.52% theoretical prediction error and retains functionality post transistor-level mapping.

Conclusion: White-Op offers a novel, interpretable, and reliable solution for op-amp design. It outperforms black-box methods and is also available as an open-source tool for further research and application.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

*Yuzhe Chen,Jie Cao,Youquan Wang,Haicheng Tao,Darko B. Vukovic,Jia Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CNRE integrates causal inference into a Neuro-Symbolic framework to improve both performance and explainability in multi-behavior recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between recommendation performance and explainability, while overcoming limited generalizability in existing explainable models caused by dependency on external data.

Method: CNRE utilizes endogenous logic in user behavior chains, applies hierarchical preference propagation for cross-behavior dependencies, and performs human-like neural-logic reasoning to mitigate confounding effects.

Result: Extensive experiments on three large datasets show CNRE's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, providing multi-level explainability for recommendations.

Conclusion: CNRE improves recommendation systems by producing explainable and high-quality results through causal, Neuro-Symbolic reasoning, resolving issues of confounding effects and external dependency.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

*Jennifer Haase,Jana Gonnermann-Müller,Paul H. P. Hanel,Nicolas Leins,Thomas Kosch,Jan Mendling,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study compares the relative influence of prompts, model choice, and sampling stochasticity on LLM outputs. Evaluating 12 LLMs across 10 prompts, it finds that model choice and prompts have comparable effects on output quality, but model choice overwhelmingly affects output quantity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine how different factors (prompts, model choice, stochasticity) contribute to the variability in outputs from large language models.

Method: The researchers evaluate 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each, totaling 12,000 samples, to analyze the variance in output quality and quantity.

Result: Prompts explain 36.43% of the variance in output quality, comparable to model choice (40.94%), while output quantity is predominantly influenced by model choice and within-LLM variance, with prompts contributing minimally (4.22%).

Conclusion: Prompts are influential in steering output quality but less so for output quantity. Also, substantial within-LLM variance highlights the importance of avoiding single-sample evaluations, as they can misrepresent true prompt or model effects.

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in processing long-horizon EHRs, which exceed language model context limits and require retaining clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies.

Method: EHR-RAG introduces three key components: 1) Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval for structure and temporal dynamics, 2) Adaptive Iterative Retrieval for expanding evidence coverage, and 3) Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning for dealing with factual and counterfactual evidence.

Result: EHR-RAG achieves significant improvements in long-horizon EHR prediction tasks, outperforming baseline models with a Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

Conclusion: EHR-RAG demonstrates the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented LLMs for structured EHR data, showing potential to enhance clinical prediction in practical applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL showcases robust FSRS-specific capabilities and establishes a new state-of-the-art. The resources will be released publicly for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

### [45] [KAPSO: A Knowledge-grounded framework for Autonomous Program Synthesis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21526)
*Alireza Nadaf,Alireza Mohammadshahi,Majid Yazdani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KAPSO is a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis, iteratively synthesizing and optimizing runnable code using an evaluation-driven process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-horizon failures in coding agents, such as weak reuse of expertise, brittle debugging, and lost experimental states.

Method: Integrates a git-native experimentation engine, a structured knowledge system, and an episodic memory layer to coordinate code synthesis, evaluation, and learning.

Result: Demonstrated improved performance on tasks in MLE-Bench (ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (heuristic optimization).

Conclusion: KAPSO provides an effective framework for autonomous code synthesis that tackles prevalent challenges, improving optimization and reusability of learning artifacts.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework to address GUI task execution failures through systematic backtracking mechanisms. It achieved 28.2% accuracy on the OSWorld benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents fail when encountering incorrect exploration paths and lack effective recovery mechanisms, particularly in long-horizon tasks.

Method: The authors designed BEAP-Agent, a framework modeling GUI task execution as a DFS process using Planner, Executor, and Tracker components for systematic task tracking and backtracking.

Result: BEAP-Agent demonstrated improved task execution with a 28.2% accuracy on the OSWorld benchmark, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: BEAP-Agent offers a solution to improve GUI agent task execution by introducing systematic state backtracking and dynamic task updating for better long-range exploration outcomes.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Zixing Lei,Genjia Liu,Yuanshuo Zhang,Qipeng Liu,Chuan Wen,Shanghang Zhang,Wenzhao Lian,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmboCoach-Bench, a benchmark for assessing the ability of large language model (LLM) agents to autonomously engineer embodied AI policies, demonstrating they can surpass human baselines and self-correct task failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency caused by manual oversight in scaling embodied AI systems and explore autonomous engineering using LLM agents.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark with 32 RL and IL tasks that allow LLM agents to iteratively design, debug, and optimize embodied AI policies using dynamic environment feedback and executable code.

Result: Evaluations show LLM agents outperform human baselines by 26.5% on average, leverage environment feedback to strengthen policy development, and successfully self-correct failures during simulations.

Conclusion: The research establishes a scalable, autonomous engineering workflow for embodied AI, signifying a shift away from labor-intensive methods, and sets a foundation for self-evolving intelligence in this field.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

*Jiecong Wang,Hao Peng,Chunyang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts) improves reasoning in LLMs by separating latent planning states from verbalization, achieving enhanced scalability and reasoning diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational cost and reasoning path collapse in latent reasoning approaches for LLMs, making them more efficient and scalable.

Method: PLaT decouples reasoning from verbalization by modeling reasoning as deterministic latent planning states, allowing dynamic termination of reasoning without pre-defined latent steps.

Result: PLaT shows lower greedy accuracy but achieves greater scalability with improved reasoning diversity on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a transparent and scalable approach to inference-time reasoning with a broader solution space that trades off accuracy for robust reasoning diversity.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

*Wenjia Hua,Kejie Zhao,Luziwei Leng,Ran Cheng,Yuxin Ma,Qinghai Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework combining local Hebbian learning with global guidance to improve scalability and performance for deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of backpropagation, like high computational costs and lack of biological plausibility, while overcoming scalability issues found in Hebbian learning.

Method: The proposed GHL framework integrates local updates using Oja's rule and competitive learning with a global sign-based signal for directing Hebbian plasticity updates.

Result: Experiments confirm that GHL outperforms existing Hebbian methods and achieves competitive results with backpropagation on complex datasets like ImageNet.

Conclusion: The GHL framework bridges the gap between biologically plausible learning and computational efficiency, offering a scalable and competitive alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

### [50] [Bridging Forecast Accuracy and Inventory KPIs: A Simulation-Based Software Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21844)
*So Fukuhara,Abdallah Alabdallah,Nuwan Gunasekara,Slawomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simulation framework for evaluating forecasting models not just by statistical accuracy but by their impact on inventory management performance such as cost and service levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap created by evaluating forecasting models solely on statistical accuracy metrics, which overlook their operational impact in inventory management settings.

Method: The method involves a decision-centric simulation software framework comprising a synthetic demand generator, flexible forecasting module, and inventory control simulator to evaluate forecasting models based on operational KPIs.

Result: The framework reveals that improvements in accuracy metrics do not necessarily lead to better operational performance, and models with similar error metrics can result in significantly different inventory outcomes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of aligning forecasting model evaluation with operational relevance to improve inventory management decisions, particularly in contexts with intermittent demand like the automotive aftermarket.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEMO is a system that converts natural language descriptions of decision problems into executable mathematical optimization implementations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in existing methods for translating decision problems into executable code, which are often brittle, complex, and generate invalid outputs.

Method: NEMO employs autonomous coding agents (ACAs) and concepts like asymmetric validation loops, external memory, and MBR decoding for robust and executable optimization modeling.

Result: NEMO outperforms existing methods on nine optimization benchmarks with significant margins on several datasets.

Conclusion: Execution-aware agentic architectures like NEMO are effective for automated optimization modeling, achieving superior performance and reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

*Ilche Georgievski,Serhat Tekin,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how domain model characteristics influence energy consumption in automated planning, highlighting the importance of energy efficiency in the context of Green AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on energy efficiency in automated planning despite its high computational demands.

Method: Empirical investigation using a domain model configuration framework to systematically vary domain features and test their effects on energy consumption and runtime.

Result: Results reveal measurable energy differences caused by domain-level modifications across planners, showing energy consumption does not always correlate with runtime.

Conclusion: Domain model characteristics significantly impact the energy efficiency of planners, demonstrating the need to consider energy consumption alongside traditional performance metrics like runtime.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate LLM teaching capabilities based on student performance improvements in a syllabus-grounded setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess LLM teaching abilities in terms of structured, knowledge-centered instruction, beyond problem-solving benchmarks.

Method: A syllabus-grounded evaluation framework is proposed, focusing on multi-turn instruction using structured knowledge points and example problems, while avoiding information leakage.

Result: Experiments using Gaokao data revealed variations in teaching effectiveness across models and subjects, with differences in performance for mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

Conclusion: Teaching ability is identified as a measurable, distinct dimension of LLM performance, with mixed results on its effectiveness across topics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Liquid Interfaces for adaptive system coordination, replacing static interfaces with ephemeral, intention-driven interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional software struggles with adaptability and integration for autonomous, context-dependent agents.

Method: Proposes the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP) to handle intention articulation, negotiation, and runtime semantic flexibility.

Result: Formalized the Liquid Interface concept and designed a reference architecture showcasing practicality.

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces enable adaptive, probabilistic coordination in agent-based systems with governance considerations.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

*Ruyi Qi,Zhou Liu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DataCross addresses the challenge of fragmented data across structured and unstructured formats with a new benchmark and agent framework, demonstrating better cross-modal analysis capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analytics agents struggle with unifying structured and unstructured data sources, creating a gap between industrial needs and current solutions.

Method: DataCross introduces a benchmark (DataCrossBench) containing 200 cross-domain analysis tasks and a collaborative agent framework (DataCrossAgent) combining sub-agents with a structured workflow for integration and robust analysis.

Result: DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in analysis factuality over GPT-4o and better handles complex, cross-modal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework and benchmark advance the field of data analytics by effectively incorporating and analyzing heterogeneous data sources, solving a major industry gap.

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework called DAMI to dynamically control cognitive depth in language models, bridging intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on limiting output length of System 2 models but does not address the underlying cognitive configuration issue. This paper aims to modulate how models think, rather than what they produce.

Method: The authors leverage dynamic parameter interpolation of Instruct and Thinking checkpoints, introducing DAMI to estimate Reasoning Intensity through preference learning (accuracy and efficiency) and confidence-based zero-shot methods.

Result: DAMI achieves superior accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks compared to System 2 models while maintaining efficiency, successfully combining strengths of System 1 and System 2 thinking.

Conclusion: Dynamic model interpolation demonstrates promise in achieving balance between intuitive thinking and deep reasoning within unified language models.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in complex enterprise systems, introducing World of Workflows (WoW), an environment with realistic enterprise challenges to test these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacies of current benchmarks for testing LLMs in enterprise systems, especially given the hidden workflows, state complexity, and cascading effects that typical systems exhibit.

Method: The authors developed WoW, a ServiceNow-based environment with over 4,000 business rules and 55 workflows, and created WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks to assess agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling.

Result: The study finds that LLMs struggle with 'dynamics blindness,' failing to predict cascading side effects in an opaque system, which results in silent constraint violations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reliable enterprise agents require grounded world modeling to simulate hidden transitions and recommends explicit learning of system dynamics as a new paradigm. WoW's GitHub setup is provided for further evaluation.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

### [58] [When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21433)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper finds that many AI language models misinterpret negated instructions as affirmations, especially in ethical scenarios. Open-source models perform worse, and even commercial ones show significant errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety issue that arises from AI language models misinterpreting basic negated commands, which could lead to unethical or high-risk autonomous decisions in critical scenarios.

Method: The authors audited 16 language models across 14 ethical scenarios using negated and affirmative prompts. They analyzed performance metrics, introduced a Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI), and proposed a certification framework.

Result: Open-source models endorsed prohibited actions 77-100% of the time with negations, while commercial models improved but still showed substantial errors. Agreement between models decreased, especially in financial scenarios.

Conclusion: Current alignment techniques fail to ensure that models reliably interpret negations, posing substantial risks for their deployment in high-stakes contexts. Improved governance and domain-specific certifications are necessary.

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

### [59] [The Paradox of Robustness: Decoupling Rule-Based Logic from Affective Noise in High-Stakes Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21439)
*Jon Chun,Katherine Elkins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study analyzes the robustness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to emotional framing effects in rule-bound decision-making, finding that LLMs display an unexpectedly high level of resistance to such biases compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the gap in understanding how robust LLMs are in rule-based, consequential decision-making contexts, especially given their documented lexical brittleness and sycophancy.

Method: The authors use a controlled perturbation framework across domains like healthcare, law, and finance to measure the robustness of LLMs compared to human subjects in response to narrative manipulation.

Result: LLMs exhibit 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than humans, with a near-zero effect size (Cohen's h = 0.003) versus substantial human biases (Cohen's h between 0.3 and 0.8).

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate an ability to decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a stable decision-making system that could help de-bias human judgment in institutional contexts.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

*Xunkai Li,Zhengyu Wu,Zekai Chen,Henan Sun,Daohan Su,Guang Zeng,Hongchao Qin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LION, a new framework for multimodal-attributed graphs addressing context neglect in modality alignment and limited fusion adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in aligning and fusing modalities in multimodal-attributed graphs and to enhance the performance of various downstream tasks.

Method: The proposed LION method utilizes Clifford algebra for geometric-induced graph propagation and an adaptive holographic aggregation mechanism to improve modality alignment and fusion.

Result: LION significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines across 9 datasets and several graph and modality-oriented tasks.

Conclusion: LION effectively addresses limitations in current multimodal graph neural paradigms by leveraging advanced geometric and aggregation techniques to improve modality interactions.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

### [61] [Topeax -- An Improved Clustering Topic Model with Density Peak Detection and Lexical-Semantic Term Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21465)
*Márton Kardos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques clustering-based topic models like Top2Vec and BERTopic for their limitations and introduces a new method called Topeax, which delivers superior cluster recovery and topic description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings in existing clustering-based topic models, such as unreliability in discovering natural text clusters and weaknesses in estimating term importance.

Method: Topeax uses peak detection in density estimates for discovering the number of clusters and combines lexical and semantic metrics to improve topic keyword quality.

Result: Topeax performs better in cluster recovery, generates coherent topic descriptions, and behaves robustly against changes in sample size and hyperparameters compared to Top2Vec and BERTopic.

Conclusion: Topeax mitigates significant limitations of existing text clustering methods and presents a reliable, quality-driven alternative for topic modeling in text corpora.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

### [62] [MemOCR: Layout-Aware Visual Memory for Efficient Long-Horizon Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21468)
*Yaorui Shi,Shugui Liu,Yu Yang,Wenyu Mao,Yuxin Chen,Qi GU,Hui Su,Xunliang Cai,Xiang Wang,An Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemOCR introduces a multimodal memory system that compacts interaction histories into visually-structured images to prioritize essential information under limited context budgets, surpassing text-based methods in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a memory system that efficiently compresses growing interaction logs into a constrained context, overcoming inefficiencies of uniform text serialization which often wastes resources on low-priority details.

Method: MemOCR structures memory as rich text, converts it into visually optimized images for memory access, and trains the system using reinforcement learning to handle diverse memory budgets by focusing on high-value information.

Result: MemOCR demonstrates superior performance on long-context question-answering tasks, exceeding text-based memory systems, particularly under stringent memory constraints.

Conclusion: Using visual layout and adaptive density, MemOCR efficiently utilizes limited memory budgets and improves long-horizon reasoning, making it a step forward in multimodal memory systems.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

Conclusion: This study validates hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity as a feasible solution for adaptive and efficient control systems tailored for real-world, robotic applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible learning mechanism through synaptic plasticity, enabling unsupervised adaptation without the computational overhead of backpropagation. To harness this capability for robotics, this paper presents FireFly-P, an FPGA-based hardware accelerator that implements a novel plasticity algorithm for real-time adaptive control. By leveraging on-chip plasticity, our architecture enhances the network's generalization, ensuring robust performance in dynamic and unstructured environments. The hardware design achieves an end-to-end latency of just 8~$μ$s for both inference and plasticity updates, enabling rapid adaptation to unseen scenarios. Implemented on a tiny Cmod A7-35T FPGA, FireFly-P consumes only 0.713~W and $\sim$10K~LUTs, making it ideal for power- and resource-constrained embedded robotic platforms. This work demonstrates that hardware-accelerated SNN plasticity is a viable path toward enabling adaptive, low-latency, and energy-efficient control systems.

*Pin-Han Ho,Limei Peng,Yiming Miao,Xu Fan,Kairan Liang,Haoran Mei,Wei Duan*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a cost-effective sensing technique utilizing wireless radios for integrated sensing and communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable cost-effective, hardware-efficient sensing capabilities integrated directly into future 6G radios without relying on dedicated radar.

Method: The proposed Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA) leverages frequency agility and uses a single RF chain with a frequency-scanning antenna to achieve spatial sensing, embedding sensing into the communication RF chain.

Result: FaA delivers fine angular and range discrimination under limited power and cost, outperforming MIMO-based sensing by ensuring architectural efficiency.

Conclusion: FaA indicates that sensing can be embedded in frequency-agile radios, providing efficient, integrated ISAC solutions for applications like smart homes and wearable devices.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be natively supported by future 6G wireless radios, yet most mmWave sensing solutions still rely on dedicated radar hardware incompatible with cost and power constrained wireless nodes. This article introduces Frequency-as-Aperture (FaA), a wireless-first sensing paradigm that repurposes inherent frequency agility into a virtual sensing aperture, enabling near-field perception with minimal RF front end complexity. Using a single RF chain and a frequency-scanning leaky-wave antenna, FaA achieves two dimensional spatial sensing by reusing the local oscillator (LO) frequency sweep already employed for wideband communication. From a wireless-system perspective, this shifts spatial sampling from the antenna domain to the frequency domain, embedding radar-grade spatial fingerprints directly into the communication RF chain. A case study shows that FaA provides fine angular and range discrimination with low power consumption and unit cost, demonstrating significantly higher architectural efficiency than conventional multi-channel MIMO based sensing under identical physical and spectral constraints. These results indicate that near-field sensing can be seamlessly integrated into frequency-agile wireless radios, enabling hardware-efficient, embeddable, and privacy-preserving ISAC nodes for smart homes, wearables, and industrial edge deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents DeepSearchQA, a benchmark designed for testing the ability of models to perform complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks across various fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Better methods are needed to evaluate AI agents' capabilities in systematically gathering, organizing, and reasoning across difficult multi-step tasks, rather than just single-answer retrieval.

Method: The authors created a novel dataset with 900 handcrafted tasks requiring step-by-step causal reasoning, testing an AI's accuracy, recall, precision, and reasoning across long planning horizons.

Result: State-of-the-art models underperformed on DeepSearchQA, revealing issues such as premature stopping, low precision, and overcompensation with low-confidence answers.

Conclusion: DeepSearchQA highlights critical weaknesses in current AI agents, offering a crucial benchmarking tool to drive advancements in complex information retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DeepSearchQA, a 900-prompt benchmark for evaluating agents on difficult multi-step information-seeking tasks across 17 different fields. Unlike traditional benchmarks that target single answer retrieval or broad-spectrum factuality, DeepSearchQA features a dataset of challenging, handcrafted tasks designed to evaluate an agent's ability to execute complex search plans to generate exhaustive answer lists. This shift in design explicitly tests three critical, yet under-evaluated capabilities: 1) systematic collation of fragmented information from disparate sources, 2) de-duplication and entity resolution to ensure precision, and 3) the ability to reason about stopping criteria within an open-ended search space. Each task is structured as a causal chain, where discovering information for one step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one, stressing long-horizon planning and context retention. All tasks are grounded in the open web with objectively verifiable answer sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art agent architectures reveals significant performance limitations: even the most advanced models struggle to balance high recall with precision. We observe distinct failure modes ranging from premature stopping (under-retrieval) to hedging behaviors, where agents cast an overly wide net of low-confidence answers to artificially boost recall. These findings highlight critical headroom in current agent designs and position DeepSearchQA as an essential diagnostic tool for driving future research toward more robust, deep-research capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper suggests improvements to speech recognition evaluation algorithms, introduces a detailed Russian speech dataset, and provides alignment tools and wrappers for speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance speech recognition evaluation, particularly for complex languages and cluttered or longform speech.

Method: Introduced a string alignment algorithm supporting multi-reference labeling and word alignment, created a Russian speech test set, and developed tools for streaming recognition evaluation.

Result: Tests showed issues with how models adopt dataset-specific labeling, highlighting challenges in metrics; tools allow better alignment and visual comparison.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer a better evaluation framework and are shared as public resources to support further research and testing in speech recognition.

Abstract: We propose several improvements to the speech recognition evaluation. First, we propose a string alignment algorithm that supports both multi-reference labeling, arbitrary-length insertions and better word alignment. This is especially useful for non-Latin languages, those with rich word formation, to label cluttered or longform speech. Secondly, we collect a novel test set DiverseSpeech-Ru of longform in-the-wild Russian speech with careful multi-reference labeling. We also perform multi-reference relabeling of popular Russian tests set and study fine-tuning dynamics on its corresponding train set. We demonstrate that the model often adopts to dataset-specific labeling, causing an illusion of metric improvement. Based on the improved word alignment, we develop tools to evaluate streaming speech recognition and to align multiple transcriptions to compare them visually. Additionally, we provide uniform wrappers for many offline and streaming speech recognition models. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper develops UrduBench, a suite of benchmarks for evaluating reasoning in Urdu, using a novel translation framework, with significant insights into multilingual reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating large language models in reasoning capabilities for low-resource languages like Urdu lacks standardized benchmarks and has issues with machine translation systems.

Method: The authors propose a contextually ensembled translation framework validated by human oversight and use it to translate widely used reasoning benchmarks into Urdu. They evaluate LLMs using these benchmarks, analyzing performance across various dimensions.

Result: Performance analysis revealed challenges in multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks in Urdu. The study highlights the importance of stable language alignment for reasoning and identifies multilingual reasoning failures.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable framework for reasoning evaluation in Urdu and low-resource languages, offering tools for benchmarking and insights applicable beyond Urdu.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to strong reasoning capabilities; however, evaluating such models in low-resource languages remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In particular, Urdu reasoning evaluation has been limited by the sensitivity of machine translation and an emphasis on general language tasks rather than reasoning benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a contextually ensembled translation framework with human-in-the-loop validation that leverages multiple translation systems to develop Urdu reasoning benchmarks while preserving contextual and structural integrity. Using this framework, we translate widely adopted reasoning and question-answering benchmarks, including MGSM, MATH-500, CommonSenseQA, and OpenBookQA, into Urdu, collectively referred to as UrduBench, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both reasoning-oriented and instruction-tuned LLMs across multiple prompting strategies. Our analysis reveals performance differences across (1) four datasets, (2) five task difficulty levels, (3) diverse model architectures, (4) multiple model scaling settings, and (5) language consistency tests. We find that multi-step and symbolic reasoning tasks pose significant challenges in Urdu, and that stable language alignment is a critical prerequisite for robust reasoning. Overall, our work establishes a scalable methodology for standardized reasoning evaluation in Urdu and provides empirical insights into multilingual reasoning failures. This experimental setup is also broadly applicable to other low-resource languages. The code and datasets will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in fine-tuning self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models, proposing position-invariant strategies for better noisy condition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and solve the positional embedding exploitation problem during fine-tuning of SSL-based speech models using front-end speech enhancement.

Method: Two strategies were explored for fine-tuning: (1) zero-padding to avoid positional bias, (2) speed perturbations with soft-DTW loss for position invariance.

Result: The soft-DTW-based approach led to faster convergence and better downstream task performance compared to conventional fine-tuning techniques.

Conclusion: Position-invariant strategies significantly enhance the effectiveness of integrating SE models with SSL-based speech modelling in noisy environments.

Abstract: Integrating front-end speech enhancement (SE) models with self-supervised learning (SSL)-based speech models is effective for downstream tasks in noisy conditions. SE models are commonly fine-tuned using SSL representations with mean squared error (MSE) loss between enhanced and clean speech. However, MSE is prone to exploiting positional embeddings in SSL models, allowing the objective to be minimised through positional correlations instead of content-related information. This work frames the problem as a general limitation of self-supervised representation fine-tuning and investigates it through representation-guided SE. Two strategies are considered: (1) zero-padding, previously explored in SSL pre-training but here examined in the fine-tuning setting, and (2) speed perturbations with a soft-DTW loss. Experiments show that the soft-DTW-based approach achieves faster convergence and improved downstream performance, underscoring the importance of position-invariant fine-tuning in SSL-based speech modelling.

TL;DR: ChunkWise LoRA dynamically configures low-rank adaptation by segmenting sequences into complexity-based chunks, achieving better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static low-rank configurations in LoRA are inefficient as they ignore variations in token complexity and computational needs.

Method: Introduced a ChunkWise LoRA system that dynamically determines sequences' token complexity, applies adaptive chunking, and assigns optimal low-rank configurations with policy-driven mechanisms.

Result: ChunkWise LoRA outperformed traditional LoRA with up to 34% reduced latency and 38% memory savings, while maintaining or improving metrics like BLEU and perplexity on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic, adaptable approaches such as ChunkWise LoRA significantly enhance efficiency and performance for LLMs, ensuring compatibility with existing architectures for real-world use.

Abstract: Recent advances in low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have enabled efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with minimal additional parameters. However, existing LoRA methods apply static rank configurations uniformly across all input tokens, ignoring variation in token complexity and computational requirements. In this work, we propose ChunkWise LoRA, a dynamic and adaptive approach that partitions sequences into variable-length chunks based on token complexity and assigns each chunk a tailored low-rank configuration. Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: The study compares data mixing and model merging for creating small, multi-task code LLMs, finding that model merging excels at larger scales while data mixing suits smaller scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize multi-task learning for smaller, specialized code LLMs deployed alongside larger frontier models, balancing performance, constraints, and cost.

Method: Extensive experiments were conducted using fine-tuning methods on two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters) for code generation and summarization tasks, evaluated on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks.

Result: Model merging at larger scales retained 96% specialized model performance and surpassed task-specific fine-tuned models in some cases (e.g., Qwen Coder 7B achieved 92.7% Pass@1 vs. 90.9%). Data mixing proved preferable at smaller scales.

Conclusion: Careful merging and mixing strategies enable effective combination of task-specific capabilities without degrading performance, making them suitable for resource-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Recent research advocates deploying smaller, specialized code LLMs in agentic frameworks alongside frontier models, sparking interest in efficient strategies for multi-task learning that balance performance, constraints, and costs. We compare two approaches for creating small, multi-task code LLMs: data mixing versus model merging. We conduct extensive experiments across two model families (Qwen Coder and DeepSeek Coder) at two scales (2B and 7B parameters), fine-tuning them for code generation and code summarization tasks. Our evaluation on HumanEval, MBPP, and CodeXGlue benchmarks reveals that model merging achieves the best overall performance at larger scale across model families, retaining 96% of specialized model performance on code generation tasks while maintaining summarization capabilities. Notably, merged models can even surpass individually fine-tuned models, with our best configuration of Qwen Coder 2.5 7B model achieving 92.7% Pass@1 on HumanEval compared to 90.9% for its task-specific fine-tuned equivalent. At a smaller scale we find instead data mixing to be a preferred strategy. We further introduce a weight analysis technique to understand how different tasks affect model parameters and their implications for merging strategies. The results suggest that careful merging and mixing strategies can effectively combine task-specific capabilities without significant performance degradation, making them ideal for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) infer ethnicity from names with higher accuracy than existing methods like BISG, extending beyond U.S. frameworks and supporting diverse global contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a methodology for inferring ethnicity from names that surpasses traditional approaches like BISG in both accuracy and contextual adaptability across different settings and populations.

Method: The study evaluated six LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT-4o and open-source models, on voter file datasets and other ethnically-specific data sources globally. Metadata integration and reasoning extensions were also explored.

Result: LLMs outperformed BISG, achieving up to 86.7% accuracy in U.S. datasets and demonstrating strong performance across diverse international populations. Fine-tuned small transformer models matched or exceeded LLM-based accuracy for scalable applications.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a significant improvement over BISG for ethnic inference from names, offering scalable, globally adaptable solutions while addressing biases inherent in traditional methods.

Abstract: I demonstrate that large language models can infer ethnicity from names with accuracy exceeding that of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) without additional training data, enabling inference outside the United States and to contextually appropriate classification categories. Using stratified samples from Florida and North Carolina voter files with self-reported race, LLM-based classification achieves up to 84.7% accuracy, outperforming BISG (68.2%) on balanced samples. I test six models including Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-4o, and open-source alternatives such as DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-4.7. Enabling extended reasoning can improve accuracy by 1-3 percentage points, though effects vary across contexts; including metadata such as party registration reaches 86.7%. LLM classification also reduces the income bias inherent in BISG, where minorities in wealthier neighborhoods are systematically misclassified as White. I further validate using Lebanese voter registration with religious sect (64.3% accuracy), Indian MPs from reserved constituencies (99.2%), and Indian land records with caste classification (74.0%). Aggregate validation across India, Uganda, Nepal, Armenia, Chile, and Costa Rica using original full-count voter rolls demonstrates that the method recovers known population distributions where naming conventions are distinctive. For large-scale applications, small transformer models fine-tuned on LLM labels exceed BISG accuracy while enabling local deployment at no cost.

### [72] [EnsembleLink: Accurate Record Linkage Without Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21138)
*Noah Dasanaike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnsembleLink is a record linkage method leveraging pre-trained language models to achieve accurate matching without needing labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methodologically developed and accurate record linkage techniques that don't require excessive labeled data.

Method: Utilizes pre-trained language models to understand semantic relationships across datasets and performs record linkage with high precision and efficiency without relying on labeled training data.

Result: EnsembleLink achieves high accuracy comparable or superior to methods requiring substantial labeling, tested on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: EnsembleLink offers an efficient, accurate, and label-free alternative for record linkage, supporting various domains while running locally without external dependencies.

Abstract: Record linkage, the process of matching records that refer to the same entity across datasets, is essential to empirical social science but remains methodologically underdeveloped. Researchers treat it as a preprocessing step, applying ad hoc rules without quantifying the uncertainty that linkage errors introduce into downstream analyses. Existing methods either achieve low accuracy or require substantial labeled training data. I present EnsembleLink, a method that achieves high accuracy without any training labels. EnsembleLink leverages pre-trained language models that have learned semantic relationships (e.g., that "South Ozone Park" is a neighborhood in "New York City" or that "Lutte ouvriere" refers to the Trotskyist "Workers' Struggle" party) from large text corpora. On benchmarks spanning city names, person names, organizations, multilingual political parties, and bibliographic records, EnsembleLink matches or exceeds methods requiring extensive labeling. The method runs locally on open-source models, requiring no external API calls, and completes typical linkage tasks in minutes.

*Tobias Materzok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which frames LLM generation as an endpoint search in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space to enhance diversity and optimization in text and code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of path-dependent token/program search and improve diversity and optimization in large language models' outputs in text and code generation.

Method: OS-Search works by selecting a target in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space using an outer loop, and employing retrieval-grounded policies with sequence-level reinforcement learning for autoregressive decoding.

Result: In text generation, OS-Search achieves 3.1x higher diversity (measured by LLM scoring) compared to existing prompt-chaining methods. In code generation, Bayesian optimization in output space improves withheld objectives under matching inference budgets while maintaining output validity.

Conclusion: OS-Search successfully reframes LLM output as an endpoint search, enabling efficient optimization and enhanced diversity without depending on token-level path-dependency.

Abstract: We introduce Output-Space Search (OS-Search), which turns LLM generation into endpoint search. An outer loop selects a target z* in a frozen encoder-defined 3D output space Z, and a retrieval-grounded policy trained with sequence-level RL generates outputs whose coordinates land near z* under standard autoregressive decoding. This enables parallel sweeps and black-box optimization in Z without path-dependent token/program search. On stories, sweeping Z (text) yields 3.1x higher LLM-scored diversity than prompt-chaining. On code, Bayesian optimization over Z (code) improves an objective withheld from the controller under matched inference budgets while preserving validity.

TL;DR: The paper investigates statistical conditions required for learning hierarchical structure in language, focusing on the role of function words. It uses cross-linguistic analysis and neural models to study these properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how statistical properties like frequency, syntactic association, and boundary alignment of function words contribute to hierarchical language learning.

Method: Combination of cross-linguistic corpus analysis and counterfactual language modeling, accompanied by ablation experiments to study structural property influence and learning mechanisms.

Result: Function words' properties were found across 186 languages. Frequency and structural association significantly aid learning, while boundary alignment contributes less.

Conclusion: Function words play a major role in hierarchical language learning. Distinct learning conditions lead to varying reliance on these properties, suggesting diverse internal mechanisms in neural learners.

Abstract: What statistical conditions support learning hierarchical structure from linear input? In this paper, we address this question by focusing on the statistical distribution of function words. Function words have long been argued to play a crucial role in language acquisition due to their distinctive distributional properties, including high frequency, reliable association with syntactic structure, and alignment with phrase boundaries. We use cross-linguistic corpus analysis to first establish that all three properties are present across 186 studied languages. Next, we use a combination of counterfactual language modeling and ablation experiments to show that language variants preserving all three properties are more easily acquired by neural learners, with frequency and structural association contributing more strongly than boundary alignment. Follow-up probing and ablation analyses further reveal that different learning conditions lead to systematically different reliance on function words, indicating that similar performance can arise from distinct internal mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of embedding scaling over expert scaling in Mixture-of-Experts architectures, offering a new approach to achieve sparsity scaling in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diminishing returns and system bottlenecks faced by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in scaling large language models.

Method: The authors analyze and experiment with embedding scaling, identifying factors such as parameter budgeting, model width, and depth, while implementing system optimizations and speculative decoding for efficiency.

Result: The proposed LongCat-Flash-Lite model, with 68.5B parameters and a focus on embedding scaling, outperforms parameter-equivalent MoE baselines and excels in agentic and coding domains.

Conclusion: Embedding scaling offers a promising alternative to traditional expert scaling, achieving better performance and efficiency in large language models.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the standard for sparsity scaling in large language models, they increasingly face diminishing returns and system-level bottlenecks. In this work, we explore embedding scaling as a potent, orthogonal dimension for scaling sparsity. Through a comprehensive analysis and experiments, we identify specific regimes where embedding scaling achieves a superior Pareto frontier compared to expert scaling. We systematically characterize the critical architectural factors governing this efficacy -- ranging from parameter budgeting to the interplay with model width and depth. Moreover, by integrating tailored system optimizations and speculative decoding, we effectively convert this sparsity into tangible inference speedups. Guided by these insights, we introduce LongCat-Flash-Lite, a 68.5B parameter model with ~3B activated trained from scratch. Despite allocating over 30B parameters to embeddings, LongCat-Flash-Lite not only surpasses parameter-equivalent MoE baselines but also exhibits exceptional competitiveness against existing models of comparable scale, particularly in agentic and coding domains.

*Eunjung Yeo,Julie M. Liss,Visar Berisha,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework to evaluate intelligibility in dysarthric speech, involving universal phone recognition and language-specific interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated intelligibility assessment methods are either language-specific or fail to capture unique, language-dependent factors impacting intelligibility.

Method: They propose a multilingual framework integrating universal phone recognition, language-specific phonological mapping, sequence alignment, and metrics like phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and phoneme coverage (PhonCov).

Result: The framework was assessed on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil, demonstrating that PER benefits from mapping and alignment, PFER benefits from alignment, and PhonCov benefits from mapping, capturing clinically meaningful dysarthric speech patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully evaluates intelligibility across multiple languages and aligns with clinical observations of dysarthric speech degradation patterns.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of neurological disorders associated with dysarthria motivates the need for automated intelligibility assessment methods that are applicalbe across languages. However, most existing approaches are either limited to a single language or fail to capture language-specific factors shaping intelligibility. We present a multilingual phoneme-production assessment framework that integrates universal phone recognition with language-specific phoneme interpretation using contrastive phonological feature distances for phone-to-phoneme mapping and sequence alignment. The framework yields three metrics: phoneme error rate (PER), phonological feature error rate (PFER), and a newly proposed alignment-free measure, phoneme coverage (PhonCov). Analysis on English, Spanish, Italian, and Tamil show that PER benefits from the combination of mapping and alignment, PFER from alignment alone, and PhonCov from mapping. Further analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework captures clinically meaningful patterns of intelligibility degradation consistent with established observations of dysarthric speech.

*Zhaoyi Li,Jiatong Li,Gangwei Jiang,Linqi Song,Defu Lian,Ying Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the failure of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize in reasoning steps that exceed their training data. It proposes a lightweight test-time correction method to deactivate certain erroneous attention heads, improving reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of sharp performance drops in reasoning hop generalization scenarios for LLMs, understanding the internal errors and proposing methods to fix them.

Method: The authors identify specific attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), that mistakenly amplify incorrect reasoning. They propose dynamically deactivating these heads during test time to correct errors.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that test-time correction consistently improves reasoning generalization across multiple tasks and LLMs.

Conclusion: Deactivating erroneous attention heads can effectively mitigate reasoning errors, improving generalization and suggesting a viable method to enhance LLM performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has become the standard paradigm for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. However, recent studies reveal a sharp performance drop in reasoning hop generalization scenarios, where the required number of reasoning steps exceeds training distributions while the underlying algorithm remains unchanged. The internal mechanisms driving this failure remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on tasks from multiple domains, and find that errors concentrate at token positions of a few critical error types, rather than being uniformly distributed. Closer inspection reveals that these token-level erroneous predictions stem from internal competition mechanisms: certain attention heads, termed erroneous processing heads (ep heads), tip the balance by amplifying incorrect reasoning trajectories while suppressing correct ones. Notably, removing individual ep heads during inference can often restore the correct predictions. Motivated by these insights, we propose test-time correction of reasoning, a lightweight intervention method that dynamically identifies and deactivates ep heads in the reasoning process. Extensive experiments across different tasks and LLMs show that it consistently improves reasoning hop generalization, highlighting both its effectiveness and potential.

*Christopher Adrian Kusuma,Muhammad Reza Qorib,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of language models generating factually incorrect responses due to unawareness of their knowledge boundaries. It proposes an evaluation benchmark and a novel method to make LLMs more honest by leveraging their pretraining data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate when unaware of their knowledge boundaries, highlighting the importance of ensuring these models respond honestly with "I don't know" instead of incorrect answers.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset using the open-source LLM, Pythia, that assesses honesty by considering the knowledge ingested during pretraining. It also suggests a method to utilize pretraining data for improving honesty in LLMs.

Result: A robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty was developed along with a novel method to harness pretraining data for creating more honest LLMs.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes improving LLM honesty by ensuring they recognize their knowledge boundaries, supported by an evaluation benchmark and method based on pretraining data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable of answering questions, but they are often unaware of their own knowledge boundary, i.e., knowing what they know and what they don't know. As a result, they can generate factually incorrect responses on topics they do not have enough knowledge of, commonly known as hallucination. Rather than hallucinating, a language model should be more honest and respond with "I don't know" when it does not have enough knowledge about a topic. Many methods have been proposed to improve LLM honesty, but their evaluations lack robustness, as they do not take into account the knowledge that the LLM has ingested during its pretraining. In this paper, we propose a more robust evaluation benchmark dataset for LLM honesty by utilizing Pythia, a truly open LLM with publicly available pretraining data. In addition, we also propose a novel method for harnessing the pretraining data to build a more honest LLM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fed-MedLoRA, a federated learning framework for adapting large language models (LLMs) to medical applications, which reduces communication and computational constraints while improving model convergence on heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the utility of LLMs in clinical settings while addressing the shortcomings of single-institution medical LLMs, such as lack of generalizability and safety in diverse healthcare systems, through federated learning approaches.

Method: The study proposes Fed-MedLoRA, a framework that transmits only low-rank adapter parameters during federated learning, reducing computational load. It also introduces Fed-MedLoRA+, which incorporates adaptive data-aware aggregation for improved performance in heterogeneous data conditions.

Result: The framework was applied to clinical information extraction tasks and evaluated across multiple patient cohorts. Its performance surpassed BERT, LLaMA-3, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4o in various evaluation settings, including in-domain, external validation, and new-site adaptation.

Conclusion: Fed-MedLoRA and Fed-MedLoRA+ address key limitations in applying federated learning to medical LLMs, showing promise for improving LLM adaptability and maintaining performance across heterogeneous healthcare systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGSM-Pro, extending multilingual math reasoning benchmark MGSM using GSM-Symbolic for diverse question instantiations, revealing varying model performance across languages and instantiations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual and diverse evaluation benchmarks for mathematical reasoning in large language models.

Method: Extend the MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach, creating five question instantiations per MGSM query by altering names, digits, and context.

Result: Evaluation across nine languages shows significant performance drops for low-resource languages on new digit instantiations; proprietary and open models differ in robustness.

Conclusion: To achieve realistic math reasoning evaluation, use at least five digit-varying instantiations per problem.

Abstract: Large language models have made substantial progress in mathematical reasoning. However, benchmark development for multilingual evaluation has lagged behind English in both difficulty and recency. Recently, GSM-Symbolic showed a strong evidence of high variance when models are evaluated on different instantiations of the same question; however, the evaluation was conducted only in English. In this paper, we introduce MGSM-Pro, an extension of MGSM dataset with GSM-Symbolic approach. Our dataset provides five instantiations per MGSM question by varying names, digits and irrelevant context. Evaluations across nine languages reveal that many low-resource languages suffer large performance drops when tested on digit instantiations different from those in the original test set. We further find that some proprietary models, notably Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4.1, are less robust to digit instantiation, whereas Claude 4.0 Sonnet is more robust. Among open models, GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek V3 show stronger robustness. Based on these findings, we recommend evaluating each problem using at least five digit-varying instantiations to obtain a more robust and realistic assessment of math reasoning.

### [81] [SHARP: Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles for Measuring Inequities in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21235)
*Alok Abhishek,Tushar Bandopadhyay,Lisa Erickson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHARP, a multidimensional framework for evaluating social harm in LLMs, focusing on tail risks instead of average measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in critical domains where failure can have severe consequences. Existing evaluations focus on averages, overlooking worst-case and dimensional variations.

Method: The SHARP framework models harm as a multivariate random variable, decomposing it into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability, with a focus on tail risks like CVaR95.

Result: Applying SHARP to eleven LLMs across 901 socially sensitive prompts showed variability in tail exposure and risk dimensions, with significant model-dependent differences.

Conclusion: LLM evaluations should move beyond scalar averages to multidimensional and risk-sensitive approaches for responsible AI governance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where rare but severe failures can result in irreversible harm. However, prevailing evaluation benchmarks often reduce complex social risk to mean-centered scalar scores, thereby obscuring distributional structure, cross-dimensional interactions, and worst-case behavior. This paper introduces Social Harm Analysis via Risk Profiles (SHARP), a framework for multidimensional, distribution-aware evaluation of social harm. SHARP models harm as a multivariate random variable and integrates explicit decomposition into bias, fairness, ethics, and epistemic reliability with a union-of-failures aggregation reparameterized as additive cumulative log-risk. The framework further employs risk-sensitive distributional statistics, with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR95) as a primary metric, to characterize worst-case model behavior. Application of SHARP to eleven frontier LLMs, evaluated on a fixed corpus of n=901 socially sensitive prompts, reveals that models with similar average risk can exhibit more than twofold differences in tail exposure and volatility. Across models, dimension-wise marginal tail behavior varies systematically across harm dimensions, with bias exhibiting the strongest tail severities, epistemic and fairness risks occupying intermediate regimes, and ethical misalignment consistently lower; together, these patterns reveal heterogeneous, model-dependent failure structures that scalar benchmarks conflate. These findings indicate that responsible evaluation and governance of LLMs require moving beyond scalar averages toward multidimensional, tail-sensitive risk profiling.

Motivation: This research addresses the lack of consolidation and rigorous comparison in the study of model collaborations, aiming to establish this area as a structured field with practical tools.

Method: They developed MoCo, a Python library incorporating 26 collaboration methods, 25 evaluation datasets, and flexible integration options for experimentation.

Result: Experiments showed that collaboration strategies consistently improve model performance, with some methods achieving up to 25.8% improvement in results across different testing scenarios.

Conclusion: MoCo is a crucial step forward in enabling scalable, modular, and collaborative AI systems, setting a pathway for research and application in decentralized AI systems.

Abstract: Advancing beyond single monolithic language models (LMs), recent research increasingly recognizes the importance of model collaboration, where multiple LMs collaborate, compose, and complement each other. Existing research on this topic has mostly been disparate and disconnected, from different research communities, and lacks rigorous comparison. To consolidate existing research and establish model collaboration as a school of thought, we present MoCo: a one-stop Python library of executing, benchmarking, and comparing model collaboration algorithms at scale. MoCo features 26 model collaboration methods, spanning diverse levels of cross-model information exchange such as routing, text, logit, and model parameters. MoCo integrates 25 evaluation datasets spanning reasoning, QA, code, safety, and more, while users could flexibly bring their own data. Extensive experiments with MoCo demonstrate that most collaboration strategies outperform models without collaboration in 61.0% of (model, data) settings on average, with the most effective methods outperforming by up to 25.8%. We further analyze the scaling of model collaboration strategies, the training/inference efficiency of diverse methods, highlight that the collaborative system solves problems where single LMs struggle, and discuss future work in model collaboration, all made possible by MoCo. We envision MoCo as a valuable toolkit to facilitate and turbocharge the quest for an open, modular, decentralized, and collaborative AI future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the substantial storage overhead in Visual Document Retrieval caused by representing pages with thousands of visual tokens, limiting their real-world practicality.

Method: The proposed method, CausalEmbed, relies on auto-regressive generation for constructing multi-vector embeddings, incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training to ensure compact and structured representations.

Result: CausalEmbed achieves a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining competitive performance across diverse backbones and benchmarks. It demonstrates training efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: CausalEmbed enables efficient multimodal document retrieval with minimized storage requirements and introduces a flexible test-time scaling approach for multi-vector representations, highlighting generative paradigms in this field.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) through generating high-quality multi-vector embeddings, the substantial storage overhead caused by representing a page with thousands of visual tokens limits their practicality in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an auto-regressive generation approach, CausalEmbed, for constructing multi-vector embeddings. By incorporating iterative margin loss during contrastive training, CausalEmbed encourages the embedding models to learn compact and well-structured representations. Our method enables efficient VDR tasks using only dozens of visual tokens, achieving a 30-155x reduction in token count while maintaining highly competitive performance across various backbones and benchmarks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the unique advantages of auto-regressive embedding generation in terms of training efficiency and scalability at test time. As a result, CausalEmbed introduces a flexible test-time scaling strategy for multi-vector VDR representations and sheds light on the generative paradigm within multimodal document retrieval.

Motivation: Enhance multilingual ASR capabilities, improve real-world applicability, and promote community research in ASR/audio understanding.

Method: Developed models based on a foundation model (Qwen3-Omni), leveraging large-scale training data and conducting extensive evaluations.

Result: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves SOTA among open-source ASR models while Qwen3-ASR-0.6B balances accuracy-efficiency.

Conclusion: Qwen3 models advance ASR and forced alignment, offering state-of-the-art performance, efficiency, and versatility, and are released openly to support research.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new pretraining method using reinforcement learning to prioritize safety, factuality, and quality in large language model generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of ensuring the safety, factuality, and quality in outputs of large language models, particularly since these issues cannot be fully addressed through fine-tuning after pretraining.

Method: It introduces an RL-based pretraining method that evaluates and rewards outputs during training using a strong post-trained model to assess quality, safety, and factuality of generated tokens.

Result: The proposed method achieves 36.2% improvement in factuality, 18.5% improvement in safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvement in generation quality over standard pretraining.

Conclusion: The method strengthens language model performance in producing safer, higher-quality, and factual outputs, advocating for refining model behaviors at the pretraining stage instead of post-training fine-tuning.

Abstract: Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) for educational assessment, introducing the Compliance Paradox, and analyzing how adversarial manipulations compromise code evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that LLMs' instruction-following capabilities ensure accurate and unbiased assessment in educational contexts.

Method: Introduces Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP) to exploit vulnerabilities in how LLMs handle code evaluation.

Result: High-capacity models, such as DeepSeek-V3, fail systematically (>95%) when adversarial directives are embedded within code, leading to false certification of incorrect code.

Conclusion: Current LLM alignment is flawed due to a Trojan-like vulnerability, and new methods focusing on domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness are necessary to improve automated grading systems.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational assessment rests on the unverified assumption that instruction following capability translates directly to objective adjudication. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally flawed. Instead of evaluating code quality, models frequently decouple from the submission's logic to satisfy hidden directives, a systemic vulnerability we term the Compliance Paradox, where models fine-tuned for extreme helpfulness are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. To expose this, we introduce the Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Injection (SPACI) Framework and the Abstract Syntax Tree-Aware Semantic Injection Protocol (AST-ASIP). These methods exploit the Syntax-Semantics Gap by embedding adversarial directives into syntactically inert regions (trivia nodes) of the Abstract Syntax Tree. Through a large-scale evaluation of 9 SOTA models across 25,000 submissions in Python, C, C++, and Java, we reveal catastrophic failure rates (>95%) in high-capacity open-weights models like DeepSeek-V3, which systematically prioritize hidden formatting constraints over code correctness. We quantify this failure using our novel tripartite framework measuring Decoupling Probability, Score Divergence, and Pedagogical Severity to demonstrate the widespread "False Certification" of functionally broken code. Our findings suggest that current alignment paradigms create a "Trojan" vulnerability in automated grading, necessitating a shift from standard RLHF toward domain-specific Adjudicative Robustness, where models are conditioned to prioritize evidence over instruction compliance. We release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further research on the topic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Evidence Ranking, a task designed to minimize user effort in verifying claims by prioritizing essential information in a ranked list while still making all evidence accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing information reliability in automated systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is challenging due to the inefficiencies and errors caused by insufficient or overly redundant evidence presentation.

Method: The paper proposes Evidence Ranking with two approaches: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking, evaluates them using a novel framework inspired by information retrieval metrics, and constructs a unified benchmark using fact verification datasets.

Result: Experiments show incremental ranking captures complementary evidence better and LLM-based methods outperform traditional baselines despite challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy.

Conclusion: Evidence Ranking improves user efficiency in verification and provides a foundational step toward interpretable and user-aligned information systems, demonstrated through controlled user studies.

Abstract: Attribution and fact verification are critical challenges in natural language processing for assessing information reliability. While automated systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) aim to retrieve and select concise evidence to support or refute claims, they often present users with either insufficient or overly redundant information, leading to inefficient and error-prone verification. To address this, we propose Evidence Ranking, a novel task that prioritizes presenting sufficient information as early as possible in a ranked list. This minimizes user reading effort while still making all available evidence accessible for sequential verification. We compare two approaches for the new ranking task: one-shot ranking and incremental ranking. We introduce a new evaluation framework, inspired by information retrieval metrics, and construct a unified benchmark by aggregating existing fact verification datasets. Extensive experiments with diverse models show that incremental ranking strategies better capture complementary evidence and that LLM-based methods outperform shallower baselines, while still facing challenges in balancing sufficiency and redundancy. Compared to evidence selection, we conduct a controlled user study and demonstrate that evidence ranking both reduces reading effort and improves verification. This work provides a foundational step toward more interpretable, efficient, and user-aligned information verification systems.

*Yuan Sui,Bryan Hooi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoNL, a framework that uses multi-agent self-play to unify generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation for large language models, providing improvements in tasks without ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in training large language models for tasks like creative writing and ethical reasoning by improving evaluation quality, which is often biased or constrained by the evaluator’s own performance.

Method: CoNL employs multi-agent self-play where agents propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that lead to improved solutions receive diagnostic rewards, allowing for the joint optimization of generation and evaluation capabilities autonomously.

Result: CoNL shows consistent improvements on five benchmarks and demonstrates stable training, surpassing self-rewarding baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed CoNL framework effectively trains large language models for non-verifiable tasks by enabling meta-evaluation and enhancing the quality of generation and judging through structured self-play.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for non-verifiable tasks, such as creative writing, dialogue, and ethical reasoning, remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth labels. While LLM-as-Judge approaches offer a scalable alternative to human feedback, they face a fundamental limitation: performance is constrained by the evaluator's own quality. If the judge cannot recognize good solutions, it cannot provide useful training signals, and evaluation biases (e.g., favoring verbosity over quality) remain unaddressed. This motivates meta-evaluation: the ability to evaluate and improve the evaluator itself. We introduce CoNL, a framework that unifies generation, evaluation, and meta-evaluation through multi-agent self-play. Our key insight: critique quality can be measured by whether it helps others improve their solutions. In CoNL, multiple agents sharing the same policy engage in structured conversations to propose, critique, and revise solutions. Critiques that enable solution improvements earn a diagnostic reward, creating explicit supervision for meta-evaluation and enabling joint optimization of generation and judging capabilities through self-play, without external judges or ground truth. Experiments on five benchmarks show that CoNL achieves consistent improvements over self-rewarding baselines while maintaining stable training.

*Lei Yang,Wei Bi,Chenxi Sun,Renren Jin,Deyi Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SOUP, a novel framework, effectively blends on-policy and off-policy reinforcement learning at token level, enhancing language model post-training by improving exploration and performance without compromising stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for language model post-training face challenges such as limited exploration and early saturation, partly due to low sampling diversity.

Method: SOUP combines on-policy and off-policy strategies at the token level of sequences. It uses token-level importance ratios to utilize off-policy data for prefix tokens while ensuring stability and exploration with on-policy continuation.

Result: Experiments reveal SOUP consistently outperforms traditional methods in performance and stability, demonstrating enhanced exploration and post-training efficiency.

Conclusion: Fine-grained blend of RL strategies in SOUP framework improves exploration and post-training results for language models, addressing previous limitations like instability and sampling diversity challenges.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods widely used for language model post-training, like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often suffer from limited exploration and early saturation due to low sampling diversity. While off-policy data can help, current approaches that mix entire trajectories cause significant policy mismatch and instability. In this work, we propose the $\textbf{S}$ingle-sample Mix-p$\textbf{O}$licy $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{P}$aradigm (SOUP), a framework that unifies off- and on-policy learning within individual samples at the token level. It confines off-policy influence to the prefix of a generated sequence sampled from historical policies, while the continuation is generated on-policy. Through token-level importance ratios, SOUP effectively leverages off-policy information while preserving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOUP consistently outperforms standard on-policy training and existing off-policy extensions. Our further analysis clarifies how our fine-grained, single-sample mix-policy training can improve both exploration and final performance in LLM RL.

TL;DR: Stance detection is expanded with DimStance, a resource that introduces valence and arousal annotations for fine-grained stance analysis across multiple languages and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model stance with greater nuance by incorporating dimensions of valence and arousal, enabling more precise stance analysis beyond traditional categorical labels.

Method: Developed DimStance, a multilingual dataset with valence-arousal annotations, and benchmarked stance prediction using pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings.

Result: Improved fine-tuned LLM regressors, observed challenges in handling low-resource languages, and identified limitations of token-based generation.

Conclusion: DimStance introduces a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware stance analysis, advancing stance detection capabilities in diverse linguistic and domain settings.

Abstract: Stance detection is an established task that classifies an author's attitude toward a specific target into categories such as Favor, Neutral, and Against. Beyond categorical stance labels, we leverage a long-established affective science framework to model stance along real-valued dimensions of valence (negative-positive) and arousal (calm-active). This dimensional approach captures nuanced affective states underlying stance expressions, enabling fine-grained stance analysis. To this end, we introduce DimStance, the first dimensional stance resource with valence-arousal (VA) annotations. This resource comprises 11,746 target aspects in 7,365 texts across five languages (English, German, Chinese, Nigerian Pidgin, and Swahili) and two domains (politics and environmental protection). To facilitate the evaluation of stance VA prediction, we formulate the dimensional stance regression task, analyze cross-lingual VA patterns, and benchmark pretrained and large language models under regression and prompting settings. Results show competitive performance of fine-tuned LLM regressors, persistent challenges in low-resource languages, and limitations of token-based generation. DimStance provides a foundation for multilingual, emotion-aware, stance analysis and benchmarking.

### [92] [LMK > CLS: Landmark Pooling for Dense Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21525)
*Meet Doshi,Aashka Trivedi,Vishwajeet Kumar,Parul Awasthy,Yulong Li,Jaydeep Sen,Radu Florian,Sachindra Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in traditional sequence pooling methods ([CLS] token and mean pooling) and introduces Landmark (LMK) pooling to address these issues. LMK pooling improves long-context extrapolation while maintaining short-context performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pooling methods ([CLS] token and mean pooling) have systematic weaknesses: [CLS] may under-represent distributed evidence, and mean pooling can dilute salient local features.

Method: The authors propose Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions sequences, adds landmark tokens between chunks, and uses mean-pooling on landmark embeddings for representation.

Result: Landmark pooling matches performance with existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and significantly outperforms them in long-context tasks.

Conclusion: Landmark pooling offers a practical and scalable alternative to traditional pooling methods, improving long-context performance without sacrificing short-context effectiveness.

Abstract: Representation learning is central to many downstream tasks such as search, clustering, classification, and reranking. State-of-the-art sequence encoders typically collapse a variable-length token sequence to a single vector using a pooling operator, most commonly a special [CLS] token or mean pooling over token embeddings. In this paper, we identify systematic weaknesses of these pooling strategies: [CLS] tends to concentrate information toward the initial positions of the sequence and can under-represent distributed evidence, while mean pooling can dilute salient local signals, sometimes leading to worse short-context performance. To address these issues, we introduce Landmark (LMK) pooling, which partitions a sequence into chunks, inserts landmark tokens between chunks, and forms the final representation by mean-pooling the landmark token embeddings. This simple mechanism improves long-context extrapolation without sacrificing local salient features, at the cost of introducing a small number of special tokens. We empirically demonstrate that LMK pooling matches existing methods on short-context retrieval tasks and yields substantial improvements on long-context tasks, making it a practical and scalable alternative to existing pooling methods.

*Fanshuang Kong,Richong Zhang,Qiyu Sun,Zhijie Nie,Ting Deng,Chunming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes inversedMixup, a framework that combines Mixup's controllability with LLM-based generation's interpretability, allowing for human-interpretable augmented text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing augmentation techniques (e.g., Mixup lacks human-interpretability; LLM-based methods provide limited control) and leverage LLM inversion to bridge embedding and token spaces.

Method: A three-stage training process aligns a task-specific model's output embedding space with an LLM's input embedding space, enabling mixed embeddings to be reconstructed into readable sentences.

Result: Increased effectiveness and generalizability of text augmentation demonstrated through experiments in both few-shot and fully supervised learning scenarios.

Conclusion: InversedMixup offers controllable and interpretable augmentation, mitigates manifold intrusion in text Mixup, and enhances augmentation effectiveness.

Abstract: Mixup generates augmented samples by linearly interpolating inputs and labels with a controllable ratio. However, since it operates in the latent embedding level, the resulting samples are not human-interpretable. In contrast, LLM-based augmentation methods produce sentences via prompts at the token level, yielding readable outputs but offering limited control over the generation process. Inspired by recent advances in LLM inversion, which reconstructs natural language from embeddings and helps bridge the gap between latent embedding space and discrete token space, we propose inversedMixup, a unified framework that combines the controllability of Mixup with the interpretability of LLM-based generation. Specifically, inversedMixup adopts a three-stage training procedure to align the output embedding space of a task-specific model with the input embedding space of an LLM. Upon successful alignment, inversedMixup can reconstruct mixed embeddings with a controllable mixing ratio into human-interpretable augmented sentences, thereby improving the augmentation performance. Additionally, inversedMixup provides the first empirical evidence of the manifold intrusion phenomenon in text Mixup and introduces a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in both few-shot and fully supervised scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Note2Chat, a framework that enhances LLM-based clinical history taking and diagnosis by converting medical notes to dialogues and applying a new fine-tuning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of LLMs in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings where iterative reasoning is required.

Method: The framework uses real-world medical notes, converts them into dialogues through a decision tree-guided approach, and employs three-stage fine-tuning (supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning). It also introduces a single-turn reasoning paradigm.

Result: The proposed approach achieves significant improvements in clinical reasoning, with a +16.9 F1 increase and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

Conclusion: This framework advances the capability of LLMs in clinical reasoning by leveraging scalable medical notes, a novel reasoning paradigm, and an effective fine-tuning strategy.

Abstract: Effective clinical history taking is a foundational yet underexplored component of clinical reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on static benchmarks, they often fall short in dynamic, multi-turn diagnostic settings that require iterative questioning and hypothesis refinement. To address this gap, we propose \method{}, a note-driven framework that trains LLMs to conduct structured history taking and diagnosis by learning from widely available medical notes. Instead of relying on scarce and sensitive dialogue data, we convert real-world medical notes into high-quality doctor-patient dialogues using a decision tree-guided generation and refinement pipeline. We then propose a three-stage fine-tuning strategy combining supervised learning, simulated data augmentation, and preference learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel single-turn reasoning paradigm that reframes history taking as a sequence of single-turn reasoning problems. This design enhances interpretability and enables local supervision, dynamic adaptation, and greater sample efficiency. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves clinical reasoning, achieving gains of +16.9 F1 and +21.0 Top-1 diagnostic accuracy over GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training robust tool-using agents remains challenging due to dependencies on manual intervention, non-verifiable environments, and issues with long-horizon learning.

Method: ASTRA synthesizes diverse trajectories using tool-call graphs and creates verifiable environments for deterministic multi-turn reinforcement learning, integrating SFT with RL to optimize task completion and efficiency.

Result: ASTRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, rivaling closed-source systems, while retaining reasoning ability.

Conclusion: ASTRA provides a robust and scalable solution for training language agents, bridging supervised learning and reinforcement learning effectively, and enhances multi-step decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as tool-augmented agents for multi-step decision making, yet training robust tool-using agents remains challenging. Existing methods still require manual intervention, depend on non-verifiable simulated environments, rely exclusively on either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), and struggle with stable long-horizon, multi-turn learning. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRA, a fully automated end-to-end framework for training tool-augmented language model agents via scalable data synthesis and verifiable reinforcement learning. ASTRA integrates two complementary components. First, a pipeline that leverages the static topology of tool-call graphs synthesizes diverse, structurally grounded trajectories, instilling broad and transferable tool-use competence. Second, an environment synthesis framework that captures the rich, compositional topology of human semantic reasoning converts decomposed question-answer traces into independent, code-executable, and rule-verifiable environments, enabling deterministic multi-turn RL. Based on this method, we develop a unified training methodology that integrates SFT with online RL using trajectory-level rewards to balance task completion and interaction efficiency. Experiments on multiple agentic tool-use benchmarks demonstrate that ASTRA-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales, approaching closed-source systems while preserving core reasoning ability. We release the full pipelines, environments, and trained models at https://github.com/LianjiaTech/astra.

TL;DR: KromHC addresses limitations in Hyper-Connections by using Kronecker products for parametrization, achieving double stochasticity while reducing parameter complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle training instability and scalability issues in Hyper-Connections and optimize the parameter complexity of the residual connection space.

Method: KromHC uses Kronecker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices for parametrizing residual matrices and enforces manifold constraints while reducing parameter complexity.

Result: KromHC achieves exact double stochasticity, matches or outperforms state-of-the-art mHC variants, and significantly reduces trainable parameters in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed KromHC method resolves challenges in training Hyper-Connections with improved efficiency and scalability, making it superior to existing approaches.

Abstract: The success of Hyper-Connections (HC) in neural networks (NN) has also highlighted issues related to its training instability and restricted scalability. The Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) mitigate these challenges by projecting the residual connection space onto a Birkhoff polytope, however, it faces two issues: 1) its iterative Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm does not always yield exact doubly stochastic residual matrices; 2) mHC incurs a prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^3C)$ parameter complexity with $n$ as the width of the residual stream and $C$ as the feature dimension. The recently proposed mHC-lite reparametrizes the residual matrix via the Birkhoff-von-Neumann theorem to guarantee double stochasticity, but also faces a factorial explosion in its parameter complexity, $\mathcal{O} \left( nC \cdot n! \right)$. To address both challenges, we propose \textbf{KromHC}, which uses the \underline{Kro}necker products of smaller doubly stochastic matrices to parametrize the residual matrix in \underline{mHC}. By enforcing manifold constraints across the factor residual matrices along each mode of the tensorized residual stream, KromHC guarantees exact double stochasticity of the residual matrices while reducing parameter complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2C)$. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KromHC matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mHC variants, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters.

*Abderrahmane Issam,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates crosslinguistic influence (CLI) using language models (LMs) as controlled learners to simulate and examine CLI mechanisms systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve inconsistencies in human CLI studies caused by experimental variance and to provide mechanistic evidence for CLI using LMs.

Method: The authors use LMs, manipulating factors like L1 dominance, L2 proficiency, and syntactic distance between languages, to simulate CLI and analyze cross-linguistic priming effects.

Result: The findings show that L1 dominance and L2 proficiency predict CLI, with bidirectional priming for grammatical structures and unidirectional priming for ungrammatical ones depending on dominance.

Conclusion: LMs effectively simulate human CLI mechanisms, co-activation of L1 during L2 processing is observed, and LMs can advance understanding of human CLI theories.

Abstract: Despite the centrality of crosslinguistic influence (CLI) to bilingualism research, human studies often yield conflicting results due to inherent experimental variance. We address these inconsistencies by using language models (LMs) as controlled statistical learners to systematically simulate CLI and isolate its underlying drivers. Specifically, we study the effect of varying the L1 language dominance and the L2 language proficiency, which we manipulate by controlling the L2 age of exposure -- defined as the training step at which the L2 is introduced. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of pretraining on L1 languages with varying syntactic distance from the L2. Using cross-linguistic priming, we analyze how activating L1 structures impacts L2 processing. Our results align with evidence from psycholinguistic studies, confirming that language dominance and proficiency are strong predictors of CLI. We further find that while priming of grammatical structures is bidirectional, the priming of ungrammatical structures is sensitive to language dominance. Finally, we provide mechanistic evidence of CLI in LMs, demonstrating that the L1 is co-activated during L2 processing and directly influences the neural circuitry recruited for the L2. More broadly, our work demonstrates that LMs can serve as a computational framework to inform theories of human CLI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR) for controlled text generation in Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) without additional learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve inference-time control in DLMs, which has been underexplored, by providing a mechanism to control text generation effectively based on attributes such as sentiment.

Method: The method, ILRR, steers DLMs by aligning internal activations of the generated text dynamically with a reference sequence during the denoising process. An extension, Spatially Modulated Steering, regulates guidance intensity for long texts with shorter references.

Result: ILRR demonstrates a 10% to 60% improvement in attribute accuracy while maintaining high text generation quality, tested on LLaDA and MDLM architectures, with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: ILRR provides an effective, computationally efficient mechanism for better attribute steering in text generation, showcasing its utility for enhanced control in DLMs.

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to adapt subword tokenization for specific domains or languages, improving efficiency and performance of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subword tokenization methods, like BPE, often use general-purpose tokenizers that are inefficient for specific domains or languages.

Method: A post-training adaptation strategy selectively replaces low-utility tokens with domain-relevant ones based on frequency in a target corpus.

Result: Adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baseline tokenizers with the same vocabulary size in multiple languages.

Conclusion: The approach provides a lightweight tokenization adaptation method, optimizing performance for specific tasks or domains.

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods, such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), significantly impact the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs). The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/vijini/Adapt-BPE.git.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes semantic progression in text using Allan deviation, identifying distinct dynamical regimes and differences between human and model-generated text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand semantic progression and coherence in text and differentiate human-written content from model-generated patterns.

Method: Applied Allan deviation to evaluate sentence embeddings as a stochastic trajectory and analyze their stability and scaling dynamics.

Result: Uncovered two dynamical regimes (short-time scaling and long-time stability limit); human texts have a longer stability horizon compared to large language models.

Conclusion: Semantic coherence is a measurable property, providing a framework to distinguish human cognition from algorithmic models.

Abstract: While language progresses through a sequence of semantic states, the underlying dynamics of this progression remain elusive. Here, we treat the semantic progression of written text as a stochastic trajectory in a high-dimensional state space. We utilize Allan deviation, a tool from precision metrology, to analyze the stability of meaning by treating ordered sentence embeddings as a displacement signal. Our analysis reveals two distinct dynamical regimes: short-time power-law scaling, which differentiates creative literature from technical texts, and a long-time crossover to a stability-limited noise floor. We find that while large language models successfully mimic the local scaling statistics of human text, they exhibit a systematic reduction in their stability horizon. These results establish semantic coherence as a measurable physical property, offering a framework to differentiate the nuanced dynamics of human cognition from the patterns generated by algorithmic models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called \fit for continual unlearning, addressing challenges of data deletion in large language models (LLMs) while ensuring performance preservation and robust unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of maintaining LLM performance while handling a high volume of real-world data deletion requests that can lead to utility degradation and learning issues.

Method: The proposed framework, \fit, uses three main approaches: rigorous data filtering, importance-aware updates, and targeted layer attribution to enable continual unlearning without performance compromise.

Result: \fit outperforms existing methods in trade-offs between forgetting efficiency and performance retention, as well as robustly resists attacks such as relearning and quantization recovery.

Conclusion: \fit provides an effective solution for handling privacy concerns in LLMs by enabling continual unlearning, achieving both improved utility retention and forgetting functionality in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks but raise concerns about privacy, copyright, and harmful materials. Existing LLM unlearning methods rarely consider the continual and high-volume nature of real-world deletion requests, which can cause utility degradation and catastrophic forgetting as requests accumulate. To address this challenge, we introduce \fit, a framework for continual unlearning that handles large numbers of deletion requests while maintaining robustness against both catastrophic forgetting and post-unlearning recovery. \fit mitigates degradation through rigorous data \underline{F}iltering, \underline{I}mportance-aware updates, and \underline{T}argeted layer attribution, enabling stable performance across long sequences of unlearning operations and achieving a favorable balance between forgetting effectiveness and utility retention. To support realistic evaluation, we present \textbf{PCH}, a benchmark covering \textbf{P}ersonal information, \textbf{C}opyright, and \textbf{H}armful content in sequential deletion scenarios, along with two symmetric metrics, Forget Degree (F.D.) and Retain Utility (R.U.), which jointly assess forgetting quality and utility preservation. Extensive experiments on four open-source LLMs with hundreds of deletion requests show that \fit achieves the strongest trade-off between F.D. and R.U., surpasses existing methods on MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and GSM8K, and remains resistant against both relearning and quantization recovery attacks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method, Recycling Search Experience (RSE), that enhances the efficiency of test-time scaling in large language models by reusing intermediate reasoning insights, which significantly reduces computational redundancy while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of computational redundancy in large language models during test-time scaling, where existing methods re-compute solutions and revisit failures, leading to inefficiencies in solving reasoning tasks.

Method: The proposed method, Recycling Search Experience (RSE), introduces a shared experience bank that captures intermediate successes and failures. This enables positive recycling to avoid redundant computations and negative recycling to eliminate repeated dead-ends.

Result: RSE demonstrates strong improvements in solving complex reasoning tasks across benchmarks like HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE, outperforming existing methods with comparable computational costs.

Conclusion: Recycling Search Experience (RSE) is a feasible and efficient enhancement to test-time search, turning isolated trials into a cumulative process that achieves state-of-the-art scaling efficiency without additional training requirements.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by allocating additional inference compute to broaden the exploration of the solution space. However, existing search strategies typically treat rollouts as disposable samples, where valuable intermediate insights are effectively discarded after each trial. This systemic memorylessness leads to massive computational redundancy, as models repeatedly re-derive discovered conclusions and revisit known dead ends across extensive attempts. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Recycling Search Experience (RSE)}, a self-guided, training-free strategy that turns test-time search from a series of isolated trials into a cumulative process. By actively distilling raw trajectories into a shared experience bank, RSE enables positive recycling of intermediate conclusions to shortcut redundant derivations and negative recycling of failure patterns to prune encountered dead ends. Theoretically, we provide an analysis that formalizes the efficiency gains of RSE, validating its advantage over independent sampling in solving complex reasoning tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments on HMMT24, HMMT25, IMO-Bench, and HLE show that RSE consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art scaling efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAVID-GRPO, an efficient RL framework enabling small language models to achieve high performance in multi-hop reasoning tasks under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training small language models in cost-effective, low-accuracy regimes by overcoming sparse exploration, poor credit assignment, and unstable training.

Method: The framework (DAVID-GRPO) employs minimal supervision for stabilizing early learning, evidence recall-based credit assignment, and truncated near-miss trajectory resampling to improve exploration.

Result: DAVID-GRPO outperforms prior large-scale RL methods on six multi-hop QA benchmarks, even when using small models and limited computational resources.

Conclusion: Small language models can achieve competitive multi-hop reasoning efficiencies with the incorporation of proper inductive biases and budget-aware RL strategies.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has empowered multi-turn reasoning agents with retrieval and tools, existing successes largely depend on extensive on-policy rollouts in high-cost, high-accuracy regimes. Under realistic resource constraints that cannot support large models or dense explorations, however, small language model agents fall into a low-cost, low-accuracy regime, where limited rollout budgets lead to sparse exploration, sparse credit assignment, and unstable training. In this work, we challenge this trade-off and show that small language models can achieve strong multi-hop reasoning under resource constraints. We introduce DAVID-GRPO, a budget-efficient RL framework that (i) stabilizes early learning with minimal supervision, (ii) assigns retrieval credit based on evidence recall, and (iii) improves exploration by resampling truncated near-miss trajectories. Evaluated on agents up to 1.5B parameters trained on only four RTX 3090 GPUs, DAVID-GRPO consistently outperforms prior RL methods designed for large-scale settings on six multi-hop QA benchmarks. These results show that with the right inductive biases, small agents can achieve low training cost with high accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OG-MAR, a system to improve cultural sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) using an ontology-guided multi-agent reasoning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with cultural misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and lack of structured value representation, which impacts consistency and interpretability.

Method: OG-MAR combines global cultural ontology and demographic profiles to guide reasoning. It uses competency questions to create structured relations and synthesizes value personas with a judgment agent to enforce alignment during inference.

Result: Experiments demonstrate OG-MAR improves cultural alignment, reasoning transparency, and robustness across different LLM models.

Conclusion: OG-MAR enhances consistent and interpretable cultural reasoning performance in LLMs by integrating structured values and demographic grounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.

### [105] [Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21709)
*Qingyue Yang,Jie Wang,Xing Li,Yinqi Bai,Xialiang Tong,Huiling Zhen,Jianye Hao,Mingxuan Yuan,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes TAPPA, a framework to understand and analyze diverse attention patterns in LLMs through temporal mathematical formulations, and demonstrates its utility in improving LLM efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention pattern insights in LLMs are fragmented and lack a cohesive explanation, hindering deeper understanding and efficient optimization of LLM behavior.

Method: Introducing TAPPA, a framework classifying attention patterns into predictable and unpredictable categories, deriving their behaviors mathematically by analyzing query self-similarity temporally, and applying its principles to tasks like KV cache compression and model pruning.

Result: The framework reveals how predictable patterns arise from temporal query self-similarity and enhances LLM efficiency through improved KV cache compression and model pruning using a simple TAPPA-motivated metric.

Conclusion: TAPPA effectively unifies diverse attention patterns in LLMs, provides mathematical insights into their behaviors, and demonstrates practical benefits in tasks like model pruning and inference acceleration, showcasing its value for optimizing LLMs.

Abstract: Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.

*Huiyuan Lai,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACLer, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework, improving reasoning efficiency and accuracy by balancing thinking modes and reducing computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance performance on reasoning tasks by mitigating inefficiencies like redundant steps and high computational cost often found in long chain-of-thought reasoning processes.

Method: TACLer introduces a tailored curriculum learning approach and a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm within multi-stage RL training to progressively enhance learning and reasoning efficiency.

Result: TACLer reduces training compute by over 50%, inference token usage by over 42%, and improves accuracy by over 9%, outperforming baseline models across four complex math datasets.

Conclusion: TACLer effectively balances efficiency and reasoning performance, offering computational and accuracy advantages over traditional long chain-of-thought models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, especially when equipped with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, eliciting long CoT typically requires large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) training, while often leading to overthinking with redundant intermediate steps. To improve learning and reasoning efficiency, while preserving or even enhancing performance, we propose TACLer, a model-tailored curriculum reinforcement learning framework that gradually increases the complexity of the data based on the model's proficiency in multi-stage RL training. TACLer features two core components: (i) tailored curriculum learning that determines what knowledge the model lacks and needs to learn in progressive stages; (ii) a hybrid Thinking/NoThinking reasoning paradigm that balances accuracy and efficiency by enabling or disabling the Thinking mode. Our experiments show that TACLer yields a twofold advantage in learning and reasoning: (i) it reduces computational cost, cutting training compute by over 50% compared to long thinking models and reducing inference token usage by over 42% relative to the base model; and (ii) it improves accuracy by over 9% on the base model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art Nothinking and Thinking baselines across four math datasets with complex problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a parameter-efficient framework enhancing NLP models for sustainability report assessment, addressing issues like greenwashing and vague claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reliability and robustness of NLP models used to evaluate sustainability reports for ESG assessments by addressing greenwashing and vague claims.

Method: Combine contrastive learning with ordinal ranking to structure LLM latent spaces, alongside gated feature modulation to filter noise and MetaGradNorm for stable optimization.

Result: Experiments show enhanced robustness against greenwashing in cross-category settings and highlight a trade-off between rigidity and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed model is effective in tackling unreliable claims in ESG assessments, achieving superior robustness compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Sustainability reports are critical for ESG assessment, yet greenwashing and vague claims often undermine their reliability. Existing NLP models lack robustness to these practices, typically relying on surface-level patterns that generalize poorly. We propose a parameter-efficient framework that structures LLM latent spaces by combining contrastive learning with an ordinal ranking objective to capture graded distinctions between concrete actions and ambiguous claims. Our approach incorporates gated feature modulation to filter disclosure noise and utilizes MetaGradNorm to stabilize multi-objective optimization. Experiments in cross-category settings demonstrate superior robustness over standard baselines while revealing a trade-off between representational rigidity and generalization.

*Daniel Commey*

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation-driven workflow for Large Language Models (LLMs) and presents a Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES) with comprehensive methods and reproducible results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of evaluating LLM applications due to stochastic outputs, high-dimensionality, and prompt sensitivity.

Method: A workflow (Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix) was developed, supplemented by the MVES that includes general evaluation methods and specific applications, with experiments on reproducible setups.

Result: The study found variations in task performance when using generic versus task-specific prompts, revealing the importance of iterative and application-focused evaluation.

Conclusion: Evaluation-driven approaches, focusing on iterative improvement and careful claims, are essential to improve LLM applications effectively.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic "improved" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.

### [109] [Procedural Pretraining: Warming Up Language Models with Abstract Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21725)
*Liangze Jiang,Zachary Shinnick,Anton van den Hengel,Hemanth Saratchandran,Damien Teney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores pretraining language models using abstract procedural data to enhance semantic understanding and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether pretraining on structured procedural data can instill foundational algorithmic and semantic reasoning skills in models, thereby easing the acquisition of advanced knowledge.

Method: Pretraining language models with procedural data such as formal languages and simple algorithms before exposing them to traditional natural language datasets.

Result: Significant improvements in performance and data efficiency were observed. Procedural pretraining enabled models to achieve performance with less data, enhanced algorithmic skills, and showed structured understanding through neural layers.

Conclusion: Procedural pretraining is a promising and lightweight method to improve language model efficiency and performance, while separating reasoning and knowledge acquisition capabilities.

Abstract: Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.
  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific question answering using semantic substructures in knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods lack deeper semantic connections, limiting comprehensiveness and specificity in LLMs' responses for scientific literature.

Method: The proposed CE-GOCD method leverages paper titles for targeted subgraph retrieval, enhances semantic connections through subgraph pruning/completion, and applies community detection.

Result: The method outperforms baseline models on three NLP question-answering datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of semantic substructures via CE-GOCD improves LLMs' comprehension and output quality in scientific question answering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for question answering over scientific research papers. Existing retrieval augmentation methods often rely on isolated text chunks or concepts, but overlook deeper semantic connections between papers. This impairs the LLM's comprehension of scientific literature, hindering the comprehensiveness and specificity of its responses. To address this, we propose Central Entity-Guided Graph Optimization for Community Detection (CE-GOCD), a method that augments LLMs' scientific question answering by explicitly modeling and leveraging semantic substructures within academic knowledge graphs. Our approach operates by: (1) leveraging paper titles as central entities for targeted subgraph retrieval, (2) enhancing implicit semantic discovery via subgraph pruning and completion, and (3) applying community detection to distill coherent paper groups with shared themes. We evaluated the proposed method on three NLP literature-based question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other retrieval-augmented baseline approaches, confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Guidance (TeGu), a contrastive guidance strategy utilizing Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to enhance language generation without significant computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Contrastive Decoding (CD) in LLMs by overcoming its computational inefficiency and the instability of existing layer-dependent methods, particularly in smaller models.

Method: Proposes Temporal Guidance (TeGu), which uses Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) for self-contrast and introduces a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP) to simplify its implementation.

Result: TeGu improves performance over various model benchmarks while maintaining low memory usage and computational costs.

Conclusion: TeGu is an efficient and effective strategy for enhancing LLM performance, addressing the limitations of previous approaches like DoLa and maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) enhances the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) but incurs significant additional computational overhead due to the need for an auxiliary model. Existing internal self-contrastive decoding methods, such as Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), focus on discrepancies across different layers, which are notably unstable on small-scale models. In this work, based on the observation that LLMs exhibit local preferences, we propose a novel contrastive guidance strategy along the temporal dimension, namely Temporal Guidance (TeGu). Our method ingeniously leverages Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) to construct weaker amateur predictions for model self-contrast. To standardize the implementation of this mechanism, we further introduce a lightweight Conditional MTP Projector (cMTPP), which avoids maintaining multiple independent networks as required by other MTP modules. Across various model series and benchmarks, TeGu achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining low additional memory consumption and computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a new geometric and rewrite-based detection algorithm to identify LLM-generated texts, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of LLM-generated texts leads to misuse risks such as misinformation propagation and academic dishonesty, creating an urgent need for reliable detection algorithms.

Method: The authors propose a rewrite-based detection algorithm that adapts to measure the distance between original and rewritten texts, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experimentation.

Result: Extensive experiments with over 100 settings highlight that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baselines by achieving relative improvements between 57.8% and 80.6% across various target LLMs.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of learning adaptive distance measures for LLM content detection and demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach in improving reliability and performance in detection tasks.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini have transformed the way we learn, work, and communicate. Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance of language generation architectures by introducing new components requiring fewer parameters while maintaining or exceeding current standards.

Method: The authors propose CoFrGeNets, drawing inspiration from continued fractions, as plug-in replacements for Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks. These components are optimized using custom gradient formulations for better accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Experiments showed that CoFrGeNets applied to GPT2-xl and Llama3 achieved competitive or superior performance on downstream tasks, using only 50-66% of the original models' parameters and shorter pre-training durations.

Conclusion: CoFrGeNets provide an efficient and adaptable alternative to standard transformer architectures, potentially revolutionizing industrial and hardware-customized language modeling workflows.

Abstract: Transformers are arguably the preferred architecture for language generation. In this paper, inspired by continued fractions, we introduce a new function class for generative modeling. The architecture family implementing this function class is named CoFrGeNets - Continued Fraction Generative Networks. We design novel architectural components based on this function class that can replace Multi-head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks in Transformer blocks while requiring much fewer parameters. We derive custom gradient formulations to optimize the proposed components more accurately and efficiently than using standard PyTorch-based gradients. Our components are a plug-in replacement requiring little change in training or inference procedures that have already been put in place for Transformer-based models thus making our approach easy to incorporate in large industrial workflows. We experiment on two very different transformer architectures GPT2-xl (1.5B) and Llama3 (3.2B), where the former we pre-train on OpenWebText and GneissWeb, while the latter we pre-train on the docling data mix which consists of nine different datasets. Results show that the performance on downstream classification, Q\& A, reasoning and text understanding tasks of our models is competitive and sometimes even superior to the original models with $\frac{2}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ the parameters and shorter pre-training time. We believe that future implementations customized to hardware will further bring out the true potential of our architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zonkey, a fully trainable hierarchical diffusion model replacing fixed tokenizers in large language models, with the aim of improving optimization and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers limit the adaptability and end-to-end optimization of large language models, especially for noisy or domain-specific data.

Method: Zonkey employs a hierarchical diffusion model with a novel differentiable tokenizer that makes probabilistic beginning-of-sequence decisions and incorporates Probabilistic Attention for soft masking. Hierarchical compression and reconstruction are supported using Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM).

Result: Zonkey achieves coherent and variable-length text generation from noise while demonstrating adaptive, linguistically meaningful tokenization. It demonstrates superior alignment to data distributions over entropy-based tokenizers.

Conclusion: Zonkey advances large language models towards fully gradient-based architectures, enabling better adaptability and optimization. The model delivers methodological improvements for scalable generation and domain-specific use cases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they remain constrained by fixed, non-differentiable tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which hinder end-to-end optimization and adaptability to noisy or domain-specific data. We introduce Zonkey, a hierarchical diffusion model that addresses these limitations through a fully trainable pipeline from raw characters to document-level representations. At its core is a differentiable tokenizer (Segment Splitter) that learns probabilistic beginning-of-sequence (BOS) decisions, enabling adaptive splits that emerge as linguistically meaningful (e.g., word boundaries at spaces, sentence starts at periods) without explicit supervision. This differentiability is enabled by our novel Probabilistic Attention mechanism, which incorporates position-specific existence probabilities to simulate soft masking over theoretically infinite sequences while preserving gradients. Sequences decay probabilistically rather than relying on end-of-sequence tokens, supporting variable-length outputs. Hierarchical levels compress sequences into higher abstractions (e.g., character n-grams to word-like vectors, then sentence-like), with reconstruction via our Denoising Diffusion Mixed Model (DDMM) for stable and efficient denoising in latent space. A Stitcher ensures overlap invariance across segments. Trained end-to-end on Wikipedia, Zonkey generates coherent, variable-length text from noise, demonstrating emergent hierarchies and promising qualitative alignment to data distributions compared to entropy-based learnable tokenizers. Our approach advances toward fully gradient-based LLMs, with potential for better domain adaptation and scalable generation. We release the source code for training and reproducing our experiments.

TL;DR: This paper presents KID, a framework to improve harmful meme detection by using background knowledge and a dual-head learning model, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated moderation of harmful memes that rely on subtle metaphors and sociocultural contexts by integrating external knowledge and structured reasoning.

Method: Proposes a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head (KID) framework that incorporates structured reasoning with external knowledge and uses a dual-head architecture for semantic generation and classification.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvement (2.1%-19.7%) in harmful meme detection tasks on datasets in multiple languages, including English, Chinese, and Bengali.

Conclusion: Knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning enhance understanding and detection of harmful memes, producing robust and generalizable performance. Code and data are made publicly available.

Abstract: Internet memes have become pervasive carriers of digital culture on social platforms. However, their heavy reliance on metaphors and sociocultural context also makes them subtle vehicles for harmful content, posing significant challenges for automated content moderation. Existing approaches primarily focus on intra-modal and inter-modal signal analysis, while the understanding of implicit toxicity often depends on background knowledge that is not explicitly present in the meme itself. To address this challenge, we propose KID, a Knowledge-Injected Dual-Head Learning framework for knowledge-grounded harmful meme detection. KID adopts a label-constrained distillation paradigm to decompose complex meme understanding into structured reasoning chains that explicitly link visual evidence, background knowledge, and classification labels. These chains guide the learning process by grounding external knowledge in meme-specific contexts. In addition, KID employs a dual-head architecture that jointly optimizes semantic generation and classification objectives, enabling aligned linguistic reasoning while maintaining stable decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, and low-resource Bengali demonstrate that KID achieves SOTA performance on both binary and multi-label harmful meme detection tasks, improving over previous best methods by 2.1%--19.7% across primary evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of knowledge injection and dual-head joint learning, highlighting their complementary contributions to robust and generalizable meme understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MA-LipNet, a lipreading method utilizing multi-dimensional feature refinement through attention modules, achieving improved accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lipreading methods struggle with feature discriminability and generalization due to subtle articulatory gestures. Enhancing feature refinement is required for robust visual speech recognition.

Method: MA-LipNet employs three attention modules: Channel Attention (CA) for channel-wise recalibration, Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA), and Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA) for spatio-temporal refinement.

Result: Experiments on CMLR and GRID datasets show reduced Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), proving MA-LipNet's superiority and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional feature refinement significantly enhances lipreading performance, underscoring its importance in visual speech recognition applications.

Abstract: Lipreading, the technology of decoding spoken content from silent videos of lip movements, holds significant application value in fields such as public security. However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in conversational image generation by proposing methods to handle non-Markov multi-round interactions that rely on long-term history and context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve conversational image generation models that need to keep track of long-range history, enabling operations like reverting changes, referencing earlier entities, and ensuring context consistency across multiple rounds.

Method: The paper introduces strategies for constructing non-Markov multi-round data, designs a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching, and proposes enhancements for image reconstruction and personalization through fine-tuning.

Result: Substantial improvements in multi-round consistency, instruction compliance, and the ability to handle long-term interactions are achieved, without sacrificing single-round editing and personalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicitly training for non-Markov interaction in conversational image generation models significantly enhances their performance in multi-round settings and improves context consistency.

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

Method: Proposes a text-guided denoising model combining features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net architecture to enhance PET image quality across various count levels.

Result: Demonstrated significant improvement in PET imaging quality through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The method offers flexibility for handling complex denoising needs and potential for reducing PET acquisition time, enhancing its application in diagnostics.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a dual-domain deep learning method to address low-performance pixel artifacts in CT scans using synthetic data, eliminating the need for costly clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-performance pixels in CT detectors cause major image artifacts, making scans clinically unusable. Existing solutions fail to effectively account for correlations in CT geometry and often require expensive training data.

Method: The method introduces an unrolled dual-domain approach, leveraging synthetic data derived from natural images. This methodology exploits correlations between sinogram and image domains for artifact correction without clinical data dependency.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches for correcting artifacts caused by up to 1-2% defective detectors.

Conclusion: The dual-domain method effectively corrects CT artifacts while being adaptable to various scanner settings and eliminates the need for expensive clinical data for training.

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

TL;DR: The study explores the use of an AI model based on prostate biopsy slides to predict the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy, achieving external validation and outperforming conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic tools for predicting BCR in aggressive prostate cancer remain imprecise, creating a need for more accurate methods for risk stratification and improved clinical decision making.

Method: The authors developed an AI model trained on diagnostic biopsy slides using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning, and evaluated its generalizability across three external cohorts. They also tested the integration of clinical variables into the model.

Result: The AI model achieved strong performance with time-dependent AUCs of 0.64-0.70 across validation cohorts and added complementary value to clinical variables for prognostication. It outperformed the CAPRA-S guidelines for postoperative risk prediction.

Conclusion: AI-based histopathology models trained on biopsy slides can generalize across specimen types and enhance decision making in aggressive prostate cancer care, but further studies are needed to evaluate the added value of multimodal AI approaches.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses vulnerabilities in object detection regarding backdoor attacks, proposing BadDet+, a robust framework to improve attack transfer and physical validation while maintaining clean performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies on backdoor attacks mainly focus on image classification, while vulnerabilities in object detection remain underexplored, with existing methods relying on unrealistic assumptions and lacking physical validation.

Method: BadDet+ introduces a log-barrier penalty mechanism to unify two types of attacks: Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). It ensures the attacks achieve position-scale invariance and physical robustness.

Result: BadDet+ showed superior synthetic-to-physical attack transfer performance on benchmarks compared to existing methods, without affecting clean object detection tasks.

Conclusion: BadDet+ proves significant gaps and vulnerabilities in object detection systems, emphasizing the need for specialized defenses and validation approaches.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [123] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionVLM addresses modality bias in Temporal Action Localization by emphasizing visual input while adaptively utilizing language when beneficial, improving performance over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal Action Localization struggles with modality biases, where linguistic priors overshadow visual evidence in vision-language models.

Method: ActionVLM employs debiasing reweighting to estimate language's incremental benefit and uses residual aggregation strategies to prioritize visual signals while refining them with language.

Result: ActionVLM achieves up to 3.2% improvement in mAP on the THUMOS14 dataset compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates modality bias, enhances temporal reasoning, and achieves significant performance gains in TAL tasks through its balanced vision-language integration.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

Motivation: Address limitations in compositional structural constraints such as numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations in text-to-image generation.

Method: Developing Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a framework that employs progressive shape assembly via 2D projections, supported by a multimodal autoregressive model and dataset (SoT-26K).

Result: Fine-tuning on the newly introduced SoT-26K dataset enables significant improvements in component numeracy (88.4%) and structural topology (84.8%), outperforming text-only baselines by ~20%.

Conclusion: SoT demonstrates an effective paradigm for compositional generation with enhanced structural integrity and process supervision, providing transparent visual assembly logic.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI framework for automating the assessment of microanastomosis skills, achieving high precision in instrument detection and tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of subjective and manual evaluation methods in assessing microsurgical skills, such as inter-rater variability and lack of standardization.

Method: The paper proposes an AI framework with four components: 1) YOLO-based instrument detection, 2) DeepSORT instrument tracking, 3) instrument tip localization using shape descriptors, and 4) expert-trained supervised classification for skill evaluation.

Result: The framework achieved an instrument detection precision of 97% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured with IoU thresholds from 50% to 95%.

Conclusion: This automated AI-based system provides a reliable, consistent, and scalable method for assessing microanastomosis skills, addressing the limitations of traditional evaluation methods.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

*Jianzheng Wang,Huan Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an advanced framework called SDCI for improving training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in high-resolution remote sensing imagery using innovative modules for feature encoding, segmentation refinement, and boundary optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in remote sensing imagery analysis, such as densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which demand enhanced geometric localization and semantic prediction accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, SDCI, integrates three key innovations: cross-model attention fusion (CAF) for collaborative feature encoding, bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) to improve segmentation scores, and convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) for refining object boundaries.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SDCI outperforms existing methods in remote sensing semantic segmentation. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of superpixel-structured methods within deep learning frameworks.

Conclusion: SDCI significantly enhances training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by leveraging spatial-regularization-aware collaborative inference, making it a robust tool for analyzing complex remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Motivation: To address challenges in capturing high-quality underwater images by utilizing the spatial-angular structure of 4-D light field imaging.

Method: GeoDiff-LF employs (1) a modified U-Net with convolutional and attention adapters for geometric modeling, (2) a geometry-guided loss function with tensor decomposition, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction.

Conclusion: GeoDiff-LF integrates diffusion priors and LF geometry to set new state-of-the-art benchmarks in underwater 4-D light field imaging.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FRISM, a fine-grained framework to enhance reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by leveraging subspace-level merging with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to incorporating reasoning capabilities into VLMs often result in a trade-off, losing either reasoning performance or visual capabilities.

Method: FRISM uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose task vectors and fine-tunes scaling coefficients at subspace levels. It also applies self-distillation learning with dual-objective optimization for label-free training.

Result: Experiments showcase that FRISM significantly improves reasoning abilities while maintaining visual performance, outperforming benchmarks in visual reasoning.

Conclusion: FRISM successfully integrates fine-grained reasoning capabilities into VLMs without degrading their visual functionalities, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by merging them with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has emerged as a promising direction. However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GRDR, a two-stage text-to-video retrieval model combining generative recall and dense reranking for high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the scalability and efficiency of text-to-video retrieval for large-scale video platforms while maintaining performance.

Method: GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs per video via a query-guided tokenizer, trains a shared codebook for cross-modal alignment, and uses trie-constrained decoding for candidate generation followed by dense reranking.

Result: GRDR achieves comparable accuracy to strong dense retrievers, reduces storage requirements by an order of magnitude, and accelerates retrieval by up to 300× on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed GRDR method overcomes semantic ambiguity and cross-modal misalignment in generative retrieval, offering efficient, scalable, and accurate text-to-video retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

Motivation: Robotics applications of vision-language models encounter errors such as perspective confusion and ignoring video endings.

Method: The authors develop a specialized dataset for robotic understanding and propose a new method of considering both key frames and full video sequences for video comprehension.

Result: The Thinker model achieves state-of-the-art performance in task planning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Thinker successfully improves robotic perception and reasoning, addressing human error-prone aspects in robotics applications.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs, especially under black-box threat models, as existing attacks focus predominantly on single-image settings.

Method: Introduced LAMP, which leverages attention-based constraints to prevent effective multi-image information aggregation, a cross-image contagious constraint to spread adversarial effects via token influence, and an index-attention suppression loss for robust position-invariant attacks.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that LAMP surpasses state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates on multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Conclusion: LAMP effectively reveals and exploits vulnerabilities in multi-image MLLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced defenses in these models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTQ4ARVG, a post-training quantization framework designed to effectively quantize AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models to lower bit precision while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective quantization methods for ARVG models and associated challenges like outliers, dynamic activations, and distribution mismatches.

Method: The PTQ4ARVG framework includes (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) to address channel-wise outliers, (2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) to manage token-wise variance, and (3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) for resolving sample-wise distribution mismatches.

Result: PTQ4ARVG successfully quantizes ARVG models to 8-bit and 6-bit precision while retaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: PTQ4ARVG bridges the gap in applying quantization to ARVG models and provides a training-free solution for efficient and effective model compression.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a method improving fidelity and perception in diffusion sampling by controlling noise in the Fourier domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between perceptual quality and data fidelity in diffusion-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods, caused by noise introduced during reverse diffusion.

Method: NFCDS uses a spectral modulation technique that filters reverse diffusion noise in the Fourier domain, suppressing low frequencies and preserving high frequencies to achieve better balance.

Result: NFCDS achieves results with improved fidelity and visual perception without additional training and demonstrates effective integration into existing PnP frameworks for various tasks.

Conclusion: By controlling noise frequency in diffusion, NFCDS offers a balanced solution to fidelity-perception conflict, enhancing the performance of diffusion-based image restoration methods.

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

Motivation: To address representation collapse in self-supervised learning and ensure information preservation without relying on global regularization techniques.

Method: The proposed method, Hypersolid, uses short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions, ensuring high-separation geometry and maintaining injective representations.

Result: Hypersolid excels in preserving augmentation diversity, leading to superior performance on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

Conclusion: By operationalizing representation learning through discrete packing and local repulsion constraints, Hypersolid progresses self-supervised learning, making it effective for challenging classification tasks.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

*Jianglong Li,Jun Xu,Bingcong Lu,Zhengxue Cheng,Hongwei Hu,Ronghua Wu,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework for real-time video conferencing, addressing challenges in detail preservation and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of achieving high-quality 3D talking face representation at low bitrates, which traditional methods fail to address effectively.

Method: The method combines FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering, transmitting only key facial metadata, and employs Gaussian-based models and compression through MLP optimization.

Result: Experiments show superior rate-distortion performance, enabling high-quality, low-bitrate facial rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is efficient, compact, and suitable for real-time 3D video conferencing.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

### [136] [GeoRC: A Benchmark for Geolocation Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21278)
*Mohit Talreja,Joshua Diao,Jim Thannikary James,Radu Casapu,Tejas Santanam,Ethan Mendes,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Vision Language Models' (VLMs) geolocation prediction and reasoning abilities using a new benchmark inspired by the GeoGuessr game. While VLMs achieve high accuracy in location prediction, they fail at generating trustworthy reasoning chains supporting their decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the ability of VLMs not just to predict locations accurately but also to explain their reasoning clearly and accurately, since this ability is critical for understanding the model's decisions and building trust in AI systems.

Method: The authors collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players to create a benchmark of 800 reasoning chains for 500 scenes across over 100 countries. They also assess VLMs using LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies to compare generated reasoning chains with human-expert ones.

Result: The study finds that while advanced, closed-source VLMs rival human experts in geolocation prediction, they significantly underperform in producing auditable reasoning chains. Open-weight VLMs fail even more noticeably and do not leverage visual details effectively.

Conclusion: There remains a significant gap between human experts and VLMs. VLMs struggle to extract fine-grained visual attributes needed for reliable reasoning, highlighting a key limitation of current models.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

*Dong Chen,Ruoyu Li,Xinyan Zhang,Jialei Xu,Ruoseng Zhao,Zhikang Zhang,Lingyun Li,Zizhuang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining video footage, antenna geometry, and Physical Cell Identity signals for antenna affiliation identification, improving upon manual inspection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tower inspections are prone to errors and inefficiency in antenna affiliation identification, necessitating an automated and accurate approach.

Method: The authors fuse multi-modal data comprising video, geometric features, and PCI signals, with a novel Token Entropy Regularization (TER) module to align representations during the training process.

Result: The proposed TER module accelerates convergence and improves model performance for antenna affiliation identification tasks.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise as an automated and accurate solution, with a novel alignment framework revealing modality-specific entropy insights.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

*Rishi Upadhyay,Howard Zhang,Jim Solomon,Ayush Agrawal,Pranay Boreddy,Shruti Satya Narayana,Yunhao Ba,Alex Wong,Celso M de Melo,Achuta Kadambi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WorldBench, a benchmark for evaluating world models' understanding of physical concepts in a disentangled manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video benchmarks fail to properly isolate and assess specific physical concepts, limiting their ability to evaluate generative world models' fidelity.

Method: WorldBench is developed for concept-specific evaluation, separately analyzing intuitive physical understanding and low-level physics properties.

Result: State-of-the-art world models tested on WorldBench reveal failures in accurately modeling particular physics concepts, highlighting limitations in their current abilities.

Conclusion: WorldBench provides a scalable framework for examining and improving the physical reasoning capabilities of generative models, enabling more reliable real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

*Jie Tang,Pingping Xie,Jian Li,Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a hybrid framework combining deep learning and probabilistic graphical models for depth completion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in depth completion is effectively handling sparse and irregular input depth data in deep networks, especially under high sparsity.

Method: The proposed GBPN integrates deep learning and probabilistic graphical models by dynamically constructing a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) via a Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN) and performing Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) for dense depth predictions.

Result: GBPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks, and demonstrates robustness and generalizability across various sparsity conditions and datasets.

Conclusion: GBPN effectively integrates graphical models with deep learning, offering a robust and generalized solution for depth completion even under challenging sparsity conditions.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

*Md Nadim Mahamood,Md Imran Hasan,Md Rasheduzzaman,Ausrukona Ray,Md Shafi Ud Doula,Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mam-App, a parameter-efficient machine learning model to identify leaf diseases in plants with high accuracy, using fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising global population and technological progression demand increased food production. Reducing crop losses due to diseases, such as those affecting apples, is crucial. While deep learning enables accurate disease diagnosis, many models are resource-intensive, limiting their use on low-resource devices.

Method: The paper presents the Mam-App model, built on a Mamba architecture, optimized for lightweight operation with only 0.051M parameters. It was tested on datasets for apple, corn, and potato leaf diseases.

Result: Mam-App achieves 99.58% accuracy on apple leaves, 99.48% accuracy on corn leaves, and 98.46% accuracy on potato leaves, demonstrating robust classification performance with minimal computational resources.

Conclusion: Mam-App combines efficiency and performance, making it ideal for applications on resource-constrained devices like drones and smartphones, and shows potential for generalizability across different datasets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

*Yanfeng Li,Tao Tan,Qingquan Gao,Zhiwen Cao,Xiaohong liu,Yue Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LANE, a method for faster and more detailed high-quality 3D mesh generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face slow inference and are limited to small-scale sequences, restricting expressive structural details for 3D mesh generation.

Method: LANE uses compact autoregressive dependencies for sequence generation and implements an AdaGraph strategy for faster and more efficient inference.

Result: LANE achieves a 6× improvement in generatable sequence length and demonstrates superior performance in speed, detail, and consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LANE method offers an effective and efficient solution for generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with greater detail and speed.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

### [142] [Optimal Transport-Induced Samples against Out-of-Distribution Overconfidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21320)
*Keke Tang,Ziyong Du,Xiaofei Wang,Weilong Peng,Peican Zhu,Zhihong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of overconfident predictions of deep neural networks on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs by using optimal transport (OT) geometry to identify ambiguous regions and train the model for better calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overconfident predictions by deep neural networks on OOD data reduce their reliability in real-world settings. Singularities in semi-discrete OT reveal regions of semantic ambiguity, offering a way to mitigate this issue.

Method: The authors formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and training data embeddings to identify singular boundaries. They then sample OOD inputs near these boundaries, called OTIS, and use them with a confidence suppression loss during training to improve model calibration in uncertain regions.

Result: The proposed method effectively reduces OOD overconfidence and achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: Leveraging OT geometry provides a principled method to address OOD overconfidence, enhancing the reliability of neural network predictions in uncertain regions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [143] [Do Pathology Foundation Models Encode Disease Progression? A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21334)
*Pritika Vig,Ren-Chin Wu,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether vision foundation models trained on discrete image data can implicitly encode continuous disease progression, particularly in computational pathology, and demonstrates their ability to organize disease states along coherent trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if vision models can capture continuous processes underlying their training data and whether this capability improves their biological realism, generalization, and usefulness for analyzing disease transitions.

Method: The authors applied diffusion pseudotime to analyze latent representation spaces of vision foundation models and assessed how effectively the models recover coherent disease progression trajectories across different pathological conditions.

Result: Pathology-specific vision models significantly captured progression trajectories (with high fidelity, e.g., τ > 0.78) and correlated well with few-shot classification performance on unseen diseases (ρ = 0.92). Moreover, inferred trajectories were consistent with known biological processes like stromal remodeling.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can learn to represent continuous disease processes from discrete image observations. This trajectory-based approach offers a new metric for evaluating representation quality applicable beyond pathology to domains analyzing continuous phenomena from static data.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

*Ji-Xuan He,Guohang Zhuang,Junge Bo,Tingyi Li,Chen Ling,Yanan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SR$^{2}$-Net, a plug-and-play lightweight rectifier for enhancing spatial resolution while ensuring spectral fidelity in HSI-SR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods effectively enhance spatial resolution but overlook spectral consistency, leading to artifacts and spurious oscillations.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage pipeline: H-S$^{3}$A for cross-band interactions and MCR for spectral manifold rectification, additionally including degradation-consistency loss for fidelity.

Result: Experiments show improved spectral fidelity and reconstruction quality across diverse benchmarks and models with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: SR$^{2}$-Net enhances generality, flexibility, and achieves improvements in spatial and spectral quality without modifying existing HSI-SR architectures.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to tackle challenges in Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) by dynamically combining task-specific, global, and initialization adapter parameters, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-Incremental Learning frameworks suffer from catastrophic forgetting and lack effective methods for managing parameter fusion while maintaining knowledge transfer and minimizing retrieval costs.

Method: DAF utilizes PAC-Bayes theorem for deriving optimal fusion coefficients, combining task-specific, previous global, and initialization adapter parameters. It applies Taylor expansion to balance stability and plasticity dynamically and introduces a Robust Initialization strategy for global knowledge capture.

Result: Experiments validate DAF's effectiveness, showing state-of-the-art performance across several CIL benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAF offers a robust solution to CIL challenges by dynamically fusing parameters to balance learning stability and plasticity, addressing retrieval costs and interference problems.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS) for Class-Incremental Learning, which guides activation spaces to better handle new and old classes without interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for class-incremental learning often constrain parameters to be orthogonal to minimize inter-task interference, which negatively impacts learning flexibility and model plasticity.

Method: The authors introduce SGDS, a technique that sparsifies activation space dynamically, making dissimilar classes use separate subspaces while promoting knowledge transfer by overlapping spaces for similar classes.

Result: SGDS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, effectively managing interference and improving incremental learning.

Conclusion: SGDS offers an efficient approach to balance knowledge transfer and interference prevention in class-incremental learning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HMRMamba for better 3D human mesh recovery using Structured State Space Models, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved accuracy, temporal consistency, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HMR methods struggle with physically implausible results due to poor intermediate pose anchors and inadequate modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics.

Method: HMRMamba utilizes a Geometry-Aware Lifting Module for reliable 2D-to-3D pose lifting and a Motion-guided Reconstruction Network to enhance temporal coherence in mesh recovery.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HMRMamba surpasses existing methods in reconstruction accuracy, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HMRMamba's advanced architecture offers an effective solution for accurate and efficient video-based 3D human mesh recovery, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.

*Kailash A. Hambarde,Hugo Proença*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach called Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT) to address challenges in aerial-ground person re-identification caused by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve limitations in existing methods that cannot efficiently handle severe geometric distortions caused by extreme camera viewpoints and distances in aerial-ground person re-identification.

Method: The paper proposes GIQT, a lightweight module that rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry, along with geometry-conditioned prompt generation for global representation priors.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show improved robustness under extreme geometric conditions with minimal computational increase compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances similarity computation and representation under extreme geometric variations, facilitating better aerial-ground person re-identification performance.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore how generation tasks can improve the understanding capabilities of UMMs, an area that remains largely unexplored compared to the reverse direction of improving generation using understanding.

Method: The method incorporates auxiliary generation tasks into UMMs to create multi-representation outputs (e.g., pixel reconstruction, depth estimation, segmentation) alongside understanding objectives.

Result: Experiments reveal that UniMRG improves fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, enhances spatial understanding, and boosts generation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully deepens the visual comprehension of UMMs while improving their generation tasks, establishing a mutually reinforcing cycle between understanding and generation.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

### [150] [MPF-Net: Exposing High-Fidelity AI-Generated Video Forgeries via Hierarchical Manifold Deviation and Micro-Temporal Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21408)
*Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Yue Zhou,Jiaming Zhong,Wei Ye,Wenhui Yi,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Haodong Li,Bo Cao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method named 'Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF) for identifying AI-generated videos, utilizing spatial anomalies and structured temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing high-quality AI-generated videos from real ones as video generation models improve.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical dual-path framework: one branch detects spatial anomalies using Vision Foundation Models, and the other identifies temporal inconsistencies through analyzing MPF.

Result: The framework successfully differentiates between real videos and high-fidelity AI-generated videos by focusing on spatial and temporal residual irregularities.

Conclusion: AI-generated videos leave computational fingerprints due to their manifold-fitting nature, and the proposed dual-path framework effectively exposes these subtle traces.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

### [151] [From Implicit Ambiguity to Explicit Solidity: Diagnosing Interior Geometric Degradation in Neural Radiance Fields for Dense 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21421)
*Jiangsan Zhao,Jakob Geipel,Kryzysztof Kusnierek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in dense, occluded 3D scenes, identifies the issue of Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD), and introduces an explicit voxel-based geometric pipeline to improve instance recovery and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inability of current state-of-the-art NeRF approaches to accurately reconstruct dense, self-occluding 3D scenes due to issues like hollow or fragmented density fields, which impacts quantitative analysis.

Method: The paper identifies a failure mode in NeRFs termed Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD) and proposes an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster). This method integrates SfM initialization and 2D instance mask projection to preserve physical solidity via recursive voxel splitting.

Result: Their proposed method achieves a 95.8% instance recovery rate in dense clusters, outperforming state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs which plateau at around 89%. The method is also more robust to segmentation mask degradation, recovering 43% more instances than NeRF-based approaches.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors are essential for accurate and robust quantitative 3D analysis in dense, occluded scenes. The proposed SfM-based geometric pipeline overcomes the limitations of implicit density fields in NeRF-based frameworks.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

*Shohei Enomoto,Shin'ya Yamaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to bridge the gap between multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning by using synthetic captions for image datasets and introducing a supervised contrastive loss for better performance in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current approach to fine-tuning of deep neural networks largely remains unimodal, failing to capitalize on the multimodal advances made during pre-training. The paper aims to enhance this by enabling fine-tuning to benefit from multimodal pre-trained representations.

Method: The paper utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions tailored for fine-tuning, incorporates supervised contrastive loss for clustering same-class representations, and uses a novel inference approach relying on class-averaged embeddings from multiple captions.

Result: Across 13 image classification benchmarks, the proposed method outperforms baseline techniques, particularly excelling in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and unimodal fine-tuning, presenting a new paradigm for dataset enhancement benefiting classification tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

TL;DR: Spava enhances long-video inference efficiency for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) using a sequence-parallel framework across multiple GPUs, providing substantial speedups and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for long-video inference in LMMs are constrained by dense computation and single-GPU limitations, reducing efficiency for handling longer and complex videos.

Method: The paper introduces Spava, a multi-GPU sequence-parallel framework that employs optimized attention, load balancing, and fused forward passes for efficient processing of visual embeddings.

Result: Spava achieves speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB frameworks while retaining task performance.

Conclusion: Spava significantly reduces bottlenecks in long-video inference by enabling efficient, parallel processing across GPUs, demonstrating improved task performance and processing speed.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

*Donghuo Zeng,Hao Niu,Zhi Li,Masato Taya*

TL;DR: This paper explores seven metric learning losses, introducing diagnostic tools (VARIANCE and GREEDINESS) to analyze their effects on embedding geometry and optimization on image-retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how metric learning losses influence embedding properties and optimization remains a critical but less understood aspect in retrieval tasks.

Method: The authors propose a diagnostic framework (VARIANCE and GREEDINESS) and evaluate seven loss functions across five datasets to investigate intra-/inter-class variance and gradient behaviors.

Result: Insights show that Triplet and SCL maintain higher intra-class variance with improved inter-class margins, while Contrastive and InfoNCE facilitate faster compact embedding but risk oversimplification. N-pair yields uneven embedding spacing with large mean separation.

Conclusion: Choose Triplet/SCL for diversity and hard-sample focus, and Contrastive/InfoNCE for faster embedding convergence in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RT-DeepLoc, a framework for weakly supervised temporal localization of deepfakes, leveraging reconstruction errors through Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and a novel loss function (AICL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with fine-grained temporal localization due to the cost of frame-level annotations, necessitating weakly supervised methods that rely only on video-level labels.

Method: The authors propose RT-DeepLoc, which uses a Masked Autoencoder trained on authentic data to detect reconstruction discrepancies in forgeries. It introduces an Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss to improve decision boundaries and enhance localization performance.

Result: RT-DeepLoc demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets like LAV-DF for weakly supervised temporal deepfake localization.

Conclusion: RT-DeepLoc effectively identifies fine-grained localized forgeries without requiring frame-level annotations, offering a robust solution for temporal deepfake detection.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence in image generation and editing, and to overcome the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements.

Method: SimGraph incorporates scene graph-based representation and combines token-based generation with diffusion-based editing into a unified, structured framework for image manipulation.

Result: Empirical experiments demonstrate that SimGraph outperforms state-of-the-art methods, ensuring high-quality results with precise control over object interactions and spatial coherence.

Conclusion: SimGraph offers an effective, unified solution to integrate scene graph-based techniques for image generation and editing, thereby enhancing control, quality, and consistency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models can synthesize realistic vehicle damage images, raising reliability concerns in automated insurance workflows due to misuse risks.

Method: HERS penalizes synthetic data misuse by fine-tuning diffusion models using domain-specific expert adaptation without manual annotation, employing self-supervised image-text pairing and multi-damage modeling.

Result: HERS improves text faithfulness by 5.5% and human preference ratings by 2.3% across four diffusion backbones. Its approach enhances fidelity while mitigating risks in generative model applications.

Conclusion: HERS supports trustworthy generation of synthetic data for safety-critical applications, emphasizing its implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safeguarding domain-specific models in auto insurance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, which limits scalability, and explores alternative methods for achieving high performance in vision tasks without pairwise attention.

Method: The authors propose Vision KAN (ViK), which replaces attention modules with MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a token mixer combining patch-wise nonlinear transformation using Radial Basis Functions, axis-wise separable mixing, and low-rank global mapping.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that ViK achieves competitive accuracy compared to attention-based methods while maintaining linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: ViK showcases the potential of KAN-based architectures as efficient and theoretically grounded alternatives to attention mechanisms in modern vision backbones.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver), which accelerates Flow Matching models while maintaining high synthesis quality and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the latency bottleneck in Flow Matching models caused by iterative ODE solving and balance between training-free solvers' efficiency and training-based methods' cost.

Method: BA-solver combines a frozen backbone and a lightweight SideNet (1-2% of backbone size), employing Bidirectional Temporal Perception and Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration to achieve efficient and high-order integration for solving ODEs.

Result: BA-solver achieves comparable generation quality to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs, high fidelity in 5 NFEs, negligible training costs, and compatibility with existing generative pipelines.

Conclusion: The BA-solver successfully accelerates Flow Matching models while retaining high fidelity and plug-and-play versatility, making it suitable for efficient high-quality synthesis and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

Motivation: AiOIR struggles with conflicting objectives due to diverse degradations. Conventional approaches provide suboptimal adaptations due to rigid or fixed mechanisms.

Method: The proposed method uses an uncertainty-aware diffusion bridge reformulation with relaxed constraints, resolving drift issues. It features a dual modulation strategy to align degradations and regulate transport trajectories.

Result: The approach provides state-of-the-art performance for various restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Conclusion: UDBM effectively optimizes AiOIR by addressing uncertainty and improving control, offering a unified solution for diverse image restoration challenges.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

*Zijin Yang,Yu Sun,Kejiang Chen,Jiawei Zhao,Jun Jiang,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WMVLM, a unified framework for evaluating the effectiveness of digital watermarking in diffusion model-generated images using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for digital watermarking lack unified frameworks, interpretability, comprehensive security metrics, and employ inadequate evaluations for semantic watermarks.

Method: The authors propose WMVLM, redefining metrics for residual and semantic watermarks, and train the model in three stages to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate WMVLM's superior performance and generalization across various datasets, models, and watermarking methodologies.

Conclusion: WMVLM provides a novel, interpretable, and effective framework for enhancing diffusion model image watermarking evaluations with improved security and quality considerations.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

*Songhan Jiang,Fengchun Liu,Ziyue Wang,Linghan Cai,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PathReasoner, a novel dataset and model designed to improve reasoning and transparency in computational pathology using Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve clinical trust and enable expert error rectification by moving beyond direct diagnosis outputs to transparent and evidence-linked reasoning in computational pathology.

Method: The authors created PathReasoner, a large-scale dataset utilizing medical knowledge graphs for generating high-quality instructional samples. The PathReasoner-R1 model employs supervised fine-tuning and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning with a knowledge-aware reward mechanism to achieve structured reasoning.

Result: PathReasoner-R1 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly enhancing the reasoning and transparency capabilities of pathology models.

Conclusion: By instilling structured reasoning into pathology models, PathReasoner and its related methodologies address critical barriers in computational pathology, paving the way for more robust and clinically trustworthy systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

### [166] [Similarity of Processing Steps in Vision Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21621)
*Matéo Mahaut,Marco Baroni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines whether vision models converge on similar intermediate steps and operations in their processes, focusing on representation similarities and differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the observation that larger models tend to converge on similar representations, raising questions about the processes and operations leading to such convergence, especially in vision models.

Method: The researchers quantify the distance between model representations at various stages, track these distances throughout processing, and identify which operational steps maintain differences. They analyze different model architectures, like CNNs and transformers.

Result: Findings reveal that while similar layers between models have comparable representations, significant differences exist. Classifier models discard low-level image statistics in later layers, and transformers and CNNs evolve representations differently, with transformers making smoother shifts.

Conclusion: This study reveals nuanced distinctions in how different vision models process and evolve representations, shedding light on the specific paths leading to convergent or divergent models.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

### [167] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fault-Adaptive Routing in Eisenstein-Jacobi Interconnection Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21090)
*Mohammad Walid Charrwi,Zaid Hussain*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks under faults, comparing deterministic, optimal, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based routing approaches. RL outperforms greedy and optimal algorithms in fault-handling and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fault-resilient and high-performance interconnection networks in dense many-core architectures due to increasing fault conditions.

Method: Evaluation of three routing paradigms—Greedy Adaptive Routing, Dijkstra's algorithm, and RL-based approaches—while quantifying their performance under fault conditions in EJ networks.

Result: Under fault conditions, RL-based routing achieves 94% reachability and 91% packet delivery, significantly outperforming greedy's 10% and approximating Dijkstra's theoretical limit of 52-54%. Additionally, RL outperforms others in fault handling and throughput under congestion.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based adaptive routing offers robust, practical solutions for fault-tolerant network communication, delivering efficiency close to optimal Dijkstra without its computational overhead.

Abstract: The increasing density of many-core architectures necessitates interconnection networks that are both high-performance and fault-resilient. Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms.

### [168] [Maxwait: A Generalized Mechanism for Distributed Time-Sensitive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21146)
*Francesco Paladino,Shulu Li,Edward A. Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'maxwait,' a coordination mechanism to balance timing and consistency in distributed time-sensitive systems, demonstrating its ability to generalize and enhance existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address timing challenges and synchronization uncertainties in distributed systems, ensuring better control over timing and fault handling.

Method: Proposing and implementing 'maxwait,' a mechanism integrated into the Lingua Franca coordination language to enforce logical-time consistency and handle faults within defined bounds.

Result: 'Maxwait' can subsume and enhance classical methods, enabling deterministic configurations and structured fault handling for distributed system patterns.

Conclusion: 'Maxwait' offers a unified framework for improving timing, fault detection, and determinism across diverse distributed system scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed time-sensitive systems must balance timing requirements (availability) and consistency in the presence of communication delays and synchronization uncertainty. This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated.

*Yuchen Yang,Yaru Zhao,Pu Yang,Shaowei Wang,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces ZipMoE, an on-device system for efficient and lossless MoE inference that reduces latency and increases throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on resource-constrained edge devices without relying on lossy quantization, which can compromise model behavior.

Method: The proposed solution, ZipMoE, uses a caching-scheduling co-design that synergizes with hardware properties and leverages MoE parameter redundancy. This shifts the inference workflow from an I/O bottleneck to a compute-centric, parallelized process.

Result: ZipMoE achieves up to 72.77% reduction in inference latency and up to 6.76× throughput improvement over existing systems in edge computing scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ZipMoE enables efficient, lossless, and practical deployment of MoE architectures on edge devices, overcoming memory and performance constraints.

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures substantially bolster the expressive power of large-language models, their prohibitive memory footprint severely impedes the practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially when model behavior must be preserved without relying on lossy quantization. In this paper, we present ZipMoE, an efficient and semantically lossless on-device MoE serving system. ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads. Our evaluation reveals that ZipMoE achieves up to $72.77\%$ inference latency reduction and up to $6.76\times$ higher throughput than the state-of-the-art systems.

### [170] [Ira: Efficient Transaction Replay for Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21286)
*Adithya Bhat,Harshal Bhadreshkumar Shah,Mohsen Minaei*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Ira is a framework designed to improve backup replay in primary-backup replication by using compact hints to accelerate the process, significantly reducing replay time for Ethereum block execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the latency in consensus caused by the time required for backup nodes to replay transactions, seeking to make this process faster and more efficient.

Method: Ira introduces a framework that leverages the primary’s execution knowledge to generate compact hints about future access patterns, which are then used to optimize backup replay. The Ira-L protocol is specifically implemented for Ethereum block execution with hints containing working sets and metadata.

Result: Using Ira-L with Ethereum mainnet data, the researchers achieved a median per-block speedup of 25x in backup replay over the baseline, with aggregate replay time reduced from 6.5 hours to 16 minutes.

Conclusion: Ira demonstrates promising solutions for caching and execution in blockchain environments, significantly improving the replay time and reducing latency without substantial overhead.

Abstract: In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.
  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.
  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\sim5\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\times$ wall-time speedup).

### [171] [EWSJF: An Adaptive Scheduler with Hybrid Partitioning for Mixed-Workload LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21758)
*Bronislav Sidik,Chaya Levi,Joseph Kampeas*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes EWSJF, an adaptive scheduler for mixed large language model (LLM) workloads, improving throughput by over 30% and latency reduction by up to 4x compared to traditional FCFS policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current scheduling policies like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) face issues such as head-of-line blocking, leading to increased latency and inefficiencies in hardware utilization when handling mixed workloads of LLMs.

Method: The method introduces EWSJF, an adaptive request-level scheduler with components for learning workload structure and improving performance. These include Refine-and-Prune partitioning, Dynamic Queue Routing, Density-Weighted Scoring for prioritization, and Bayesian Meta-Optimization for tuning.

Result: EWSJF enhances throughput by over 30% and achieves up to 4x reduction in average latency for short queries compared to FCFS.

Conclusion: Adaptive, learning-based scheduling methods like EWSJF fill a critical gap in efficient LLM serving, balancing fairness and responsiveness effectively.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

*Chuan-Chi Lai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: In edge computing, SA-PSKY improves probabilistic skyline queries using adaptive thresholds adjusted via a Markov Decision Process and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, reducing costs and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in traditional methods for processing probabilistic skyline queries in edge computing, which suffer due to static thresholds that fail in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.

Method: SA-PSKY employs a self-adaptive approach using a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient agent and continuous Markov Decision Process to optimize real-time threshold adjustments in edge-cloud systems.

Result: SA-PSKY achieves significant improvements, reducing communication overhead by 60%, response time by 40%, and demonstrates robustness and scalability across various data distributions.

Conclusion: SA-PSKY offers an enhanced framework for dynamic and efficient probabilistic skyline query processing, balancing computation and communication costs effectively in distributed edge-cloud systems.

Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.

*Tom Yates,Yuzhou Cheng,Ignacio Alzugaray,Danyal Akarca,Pedro A. M. Mediano,Andrew J. Davison*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on providing theoretical guarantees for Gaussian approximations in non-Gaussian, sparsely connected factor graphs using Belief Propagation (BP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) is widely used despite being applied to non-Gaussian problems, and there is a need to provide a theoretical basis for its validity in such scenarios.

Method: The authors use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove that variables' beliefs converge to Gaussian distributions in sparsely-connected factor graphs under 4 key assumptions and validate this experimentally.

Result: Theoretical proof is provided alongside experimental validation that beliefs approximate Gaussian distributions after a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.

Conclusion: Gaussian approximations via GBP are valid in certain non-Gaussian probabilistic inference scenarios, supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence.

Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm for distributed inference in probabilistic graphical models, however it quickly becomes infeasible for practical compute and memory budgets. Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.

TL;DR: PowerGenie revolutionizes circuit topology discovery using AI, achieving higher performance and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating the vast design space of circuit topologies for higher performance has traditionally been challenging, requiring human expertise. Existing AI methods are limited in scale and rigorous validation, leaving potential for large-scale innovation untapped.

Method: PowerGenie employs an automated analytical framework to assess theoretical limits without component sizing or simulations and uses a generative model evolved through fitness-driven co-adaptation and uniqueness checks.

Result: PowerGenie discovered a novel reconfigurable converter with 23% higher figure-of-merit (FoM) than the best training topology, and SPICE simulations show up to 17% efficiency gains in a single mode.

Conclusion: PowerGenie effectively enables automated discovery of high-performance circuit designs at scale, overcoming limitations of existing AI methods and achieving significant practical improvements.

Abstract: Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology. SPICE simulations confirm average absolute efficiency gains of 10% across 8 modes and up to 17% at a single mode. Code is available at https://github.com/xz-group/PowerGenie.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DASH, an advanced framework that improves runtime efficiency and solution quality in combinatorial optimization by co-optimizing solver mechanisms and introducing efficient solver reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing LLM-Driven Heuristic Design frameworks, such as endpoint-only evaluations and high adaptation costs for new distributions.

Method: The authors introduce DASH, which optimizes solver search mechanisms using a convergence-aware metric and includes Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR) for efficient reuse of specialized solvers.

Result: Experiments show DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3x and maintains high solution quality under various conditions, while drastically reducing adaptation costs by over 90%.

Conclusion: DASH advances combinatorial optimization efficiency and adaptability, setting a new standard with reduced costs and improved quality across diverse problems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the field of Combinatorial Optimization through automated heuristic generation. Instead of relying on manual design, this LLM-Driven Heuristic Design (LHD) process leverages LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solvers to achieve high performance. However, existing LHD frameworks face two critical limitations: (1) Endpoint-only evaluation, which ranks solvers solely by final quality, ignoring the convergence process and runtime efficiency; (2) High adaptation costs, where distribution shifts necessitate re-adaptation to generate specialized solvers for new instance groups. To address these issues, we propose Dynamics-Aware Solver Heuristics (DASH), a framework that co-optimizes solver search mechanisms and runtime schedules guided by a convergence-aware metric, thereby identifying efficient and high-performance solvers. Furthermore, to mitigate expensive re-adaptation, DASH incorporates Profiled Library Retrieval (PLR). PLR efficiently archives specialized solvers concurrently with the evolutionary process, enabling cost-effective warm-starts for heterogeneous distributions. Experiments on four combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that DASH improves runtime efficiency by over 3 times, while surpassing the solution quality of state-of-the-art baselines across diverse problem scales. Furthermore, by enabling profile-based warm starts, DASH maintains superior accuracy under different distributions while cutting LLM adaptation costs by over 90%.

*Atik Faysal,Mohammad Rostami,Reihaneh Gh. Roshan,Nikhil Muralidhar,Huaxia Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a method to optimize multimodal pretraining for specific modalities used in downstream tasks without additional data or compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal pretraining approaches treat all modalities equally, which can lead to sub-optimal outcomes when only one modality is primarily utilized in fine-tuning.

Method: The authors propose FIP, a model-agnostic method that enhances the target modality's representation. It uses higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and a more capable decoder for the target modality without altering the shared encoder or needing extra supervision.

Result: When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently enhances downstream fine-tuned performance without requiring extra computational resources.

Conclusion: FIP is a simple, architecture-compatible, and general solution for optimizing multimodal masked modeling, especially for scenarios where one modality dominates in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is effective for building general-purpose representations, but in many practical deployments, only one modality is heavily used during downstream fine-tuning. Standard pretraining strategies treat all modalities uniformly, which can lead to under-optimized representations for the modality that actually matters. We propose Finetune-Informed Pretraining (FIP), a model-agnostic method that biases representation learning toward a designated target modality needed at fine-tuning time. FIP combines higher masking difficulty, stronger loss weighting, and increased decoder capacity for the target modality, without modifying the shared encoder or requiring additional supervision. When applied to masked modeling on constellation diagrams for wireless signals, FIP consistently improves downstream fine-tuned performance with no extra data or compute. FIP is simple to implement, architecture-compatible, and broadly applicable across multimodal masked modeling pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the limited number of well-characterized hydrides in existing materials databases, which hinders the discovery of optimal hydrogen storage materials.

Method: The framework integrates causal discovery and a lightweight generative machine learning model, using a dataset of 450 samples to generate, rank, and filter metal hydride candidates.

Result: Out of 1,000 generated candidates, six new chemical formulas and structures were found, with four validated by density functional theory simulations as promising for experimental studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, efficient solution to expand hydrides datasets and accelerate the search for advanced hydrogen storage materials.

Abstract: Developing new metal hydrides is a critical step toward efficient hydrogen storage in carbon-neutral energy systems. However, existing materials databases, such as the Materials Project, contain a limited number of well-characterized hydrides, which constrains the discovery of optimal candidates. This work presents a framework that integrates causal discovery with a lightweight generative machine learning model to generate novel metal hydride candidates that may not exist in current databases. Using a dataset of 450 samples (270 training, 90 validation, and 90 testing), the model generates 1,000 candidates. After ranking and filtering, six previously unreported chemical formulas and crystal structures are identified, four of which are validated by density functional theory simulations and show strong potential for future experimental investigation. Overall, the proposed framework provides a scalable and time-efficient approach for expanding hydrogen storage datasets and accelerating materials discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a prompt-sharing mechanism in continual learning to improve task-specific parameter utilization and mitigate knowledge forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most continual learning methods use fixed prompt assignments per task, which limits parameter sharing and efficient knowledge transfer.

Method: The framework employs a global prompt pool with a gated routing mechanism for dynamic prompt activation and a history-aware modulator to protect frequently used prompts.

Result: Empirical analysis shows improved performance and efficiency compared to existing prompt allocation strategies.

Conclusion: Dynamic prompt sharing and protection mechanisms enhance continual learning by enabling better parameter use and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, most existing methods assign a fixed set of prompts to each task, completely isolating knowledge across tasks and resulting in suboptimal parameter utilization. To address this, we consider the practical needs of continual learning and propose a prompt-sharing framework. This framework constructs a global prompt pool and introduces a task-aware gated routing mechanism that sparsely activates a subset of prompts to achieve dynamic decoupling and collaborative optimization of task-specific feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a history-aware modulator that leverages cumulative prompt activation statistics to protect frequently used prompts from excessive updates, thereby mitigating inefficient parameter usage and knowledge forgetting. Extensive analysis and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing static allocation strategies in effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: A novel initialization technique is devised to preserve iterative progress from prior training data in predictive coding networks.

Result: Experiments reveal faster convergence, reduced training times, and better test loss performance, enhancing both supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Adapting initialization methods in predictive coding significantly improves computational efficiency and performance, advancing alternatives to backpropagation.

Abstract: Research aimed at scaling up neuroscience inspired learning algorithms for neural networks is accelerating. Recently, a key research area has been the study of energy-based learning algorithms such as predictive coding, due to their versatility and mathematical grounding. However, the applicability of such methods is held back by the large computational requirements caused by their iterative nature. In this work, we address this problem by showing that the choice of initialization of the neurons in a predictive coding network matters significantly and can notably reduce the required training times. Consequently, we propose a new initialization technique for predictive coding networks that aims to preserve the iterative progress made on previous training samples. Our approach suggests a promising path toward reconciling the disparities between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of computational efficiency and final performance. In fact, our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence speed and final test loss in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TwinWeaver is a framework for transforming patient histories into text for use with large language models, focusing on event prediction and forecasting in oncology. The system, Genie Digital Twin (GDT), achieves significant improvements in accuracy and risk stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in precision oncology, particularly the need to accurately forecast clinical events using sparse, multi-modal clinical time series data.

Method: The authors developed TwinWeaver, which converts patient histories into text for input into large language models. They implemented Genie Digital Twin (GDT) using this framework and tested it on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types.

Result: GDT achieved superior performance in forecasting error (with a median MASE of 0.87 vs. 0.97 from the baseline), better risk stratification results (C-index of 0.703 vs. 0.662 baseline), and demonstrated strong generalizability by outperforming baselines in out-of-distribution trials.

Conclusion: TwinWeaver offers a scalable, transparent, and interpretable approach to longitudinal clinical modeling, showcasing its utility in oncology for prediction and risk stratification tasks.

Abstract: Precision oncology requires forecasting clinical events and trajectories, yet modeling sparse, multi-modal clinical time series remains a critical challenge. We introduce TwinWeaver, an open-source framework that serializes longitudinal patient histories into text, enabling unified event prediction as well as forecasting with large language models, and use it to build Genie Digital Twin (GDT) on 93,054 patients across 20 cancer types. In benchmarks, GDT significantly reduces forecasting error, achieving a median Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.87 compared to 0.97 for the strongest time-series baseline (p<0.001). Furthermore, GDT improves risk stratification, achieving an average concordance index (C-index) of 0.703 across survival, progression, and therapy switching tasks, surpassing the best baseline of 0.662. GDT also generalizes to out-of-distribution clinical trials, matching trained baselines at zero-shot and surpassing them with fine-tuning, achieving a median MASE of 0.75-0.88 and outperforming the strongest baseline in event prediction with an average C-index of 0.672 versus 0.648. Finally, TwinWeaver enables an interpretable clinical reasoning extension, providing a scalable and transparent foundation for longitudinal clinical modeling.

*Chen Feng,Minghe Shen,Ananth Balashankar,Carsten Gerner-Beuerle,Miguel R. D. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of certifying LLMs under noisy conditions and proposes a framework that ensures statistical guarantees despite judge imperfections, with theoretical evidence and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable method for certifying LLMs despite imperfections and noise in the evaluation process, ensuring statistical validity.

Method: The paper introduces a 'Noisy but Valid' hypothesis testing framework, utilizing a small human-labeled dataset as calibration to estimate judge parameters, then applying a variance-corrected threshold for large datasets.

Result: The framework guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control, validates it through experiments, and highlights the gap in performance between practical results and an ideal 'Oracle' scenario.

Conclusion: The framework provides systematic diagnostics of LLM evaluator reliability, clarifies the trade-offs in evaluation power, and offers new insights into certifying LLMs under imperfect-judge settings.

Abstract: Reliable certification of Large Language Models (LLMs)-verifying that failure rates are below a safety threshold-is critical yet challenging. While "LLM-as-a-Judge" offers scalability, judge imperfections, noise, and bias can invalidate statistical guarantees. We introduce a "Noisy but Valid" hypothesis testing framework to address this. By leveraging a small human-labelled calibration set to estimate the judge's True Positive and False Positive Rates (TPR/FPR), we derive a variance-corrected critical threshold applied to a large judge-labelled dataset. Crucially, our framework theoretically guarantees finite-sample Type-I error control (validity) despite calibration uncertainty. This distinguishes our work from Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), positioning our method as a diagnostic tool that explicitly models judge behavior rather than a black-box estimator. Our contributions include: (1) Theoretical Guarantees: We derive the exact conditions under which noisy testing yields higher statistical power than direct evaluation; (2) Empirical Validation: Experiments on Jigsaw Comment, Hate Speech and SafeRLHF confirm our theory; (3) The Oracle Gap: We reveal a significant performance gap between practical methods and the theoretical "Oracle" (perfectly known judge parameters), quantifying the cost of estimation. Specifically, we provide the first systematic treatment of the imperfect-judge setting, yielding interpretable diagnostics of judge reliability and clarifying how evaluation power depends on judge quality, dataset size, and certification levels. Together, these results sharpen understanding of statistical evaluation with LLM judges, and highlight trade-offs among competing inferential tools.

*Anni Zhao,Ayca Ermis,Jeffrey Robert Vitt,Sergio Brasil,Wellingson Paiva,Magdalena Kasprowicz,Malgorzata Burzynska,Robert Hamilton,Runze Yan,Ofer Sadan,J. Claude Hemphill,Lieven Vandenberghe,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a machine learning method incorporating system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to noninvasively estimate intracranial pressure (ICP) using signals such as ABP, CBv, and R-R intervals. Results showed promising accuracy, though further validation is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate noninvasive monitoring of intracranial pressure is crucial for critical care, particularly for acute brain injury patients, but remains challenging due to reliability issues.

Method: The study utilized machine learning by integrating subspace system identification to model cerebral hemodynamics using noninvasive signals. A ranking-constrained convex optimization approach was applied to map relationships between signal features and estimation errors.

Result: Approximately 31.88% of estimations had errors within 2 mmHg, while 34.07% fell within 2–6 mmHg, indicating good estimation performance using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential as a feasible noninvasive ICP estimation tool, although further refinement and testing are needed for clinical readiness.

Abstract: Objective: Accurate noninvasive estimation of intracranial pressure (ICP) remains a major challenge in critical care. We developed a bespoke machine learning algorithm that integrates system identification and ranking-constrained optimization to estimate mean ICP from noninvasive signals. Methods: A machine learning framework was proposed to obtain accurate mean ICP values using arbitrary noninvasive signals. The subspace system identification algorithm is employed to identify cerebral hemodynamics models for ICP simulation using arterial blood pressure (ABP), cerebral blood velocity (CBv), and R-wave to R-wave interval (R-R interval) signals in a comprehensive database. A mapping function to describe the relationship between the features of noninvasive signals and the estimation errors is learned using innovative ranking constraints through convex optimization. Patients across multiple clinical settings were randomly split into testing and training datasets for performance evaluation of the mapping function. Results: The results indicate that about 31.88% of testing entries achieved estimation errors within 2 mmHg and 34.07% of testing entries between 2 mmHg to 6 mmHg from the nonlinear mapping with constraints. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed noninvasive ICP estimation approach. Significance: Further validation and technical refinement are required before clinical deployment, but this work lays the foundation for safe and broadly accessible ICP monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and related conditions.

TL;DR: The paper develops a complete theory for optimal universal rates in agnostic binary classification, revealing four distinct rate categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the existing realizable-case theory by examining binary classification without assuming the realizability of the distribution.

Method: The study identifies and analyzes combinatorial structures that determine convergence rates for concept classes in binary classification.

Result: The paper finds four fundamental convergence rate categories for excess error rates and associates them with specific combinatorial structures.

Conclusion: The results provide a universal understanding of convergence rates, classifying them into four categories and linking them with underlying structures.

Abstract: We provide a complete theory of optimal universal rates for binary classification in the agnostic setting. This extends the realizable-case theory of Bousquet, Hanneke, Moran, van Handel, and Yehudayoff (2021) by removing the realizability assumption on the distribution. We identify a fundamental tetrachotomy of optimal rates: for every concept class, the optimal universal rate of convergence of the excess error rate is one of $e^{-n}$, $e^{-o(n)}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We further identify simple combinatorial structures which determine which of these categories any given concept class falls into.

### [184] [Monotone Optimisation with Learned Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20983)
*Ahmed Rashwan,Keith Briggs,Chris Budd,Lisa Kreusser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm-aware learning strategy to improve the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm by embedding learned models for efficient projection estimation, achieving faster and better performance in monotone optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional global solvers for monotone optimization problems like POA rely on explicit objective and constraint functions, which are often unavailable in data-driven contexts.

Method: The authors propose integrating specially designed neural models, Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, into the POA algorithm. These models respect monotonicity and homogeneity properties, directly predicting projection primitives to replace the expensive bisection step.

Result: Experimental results show significant computational speed-ups and improved solution quality on various benchmarks, outperforming methods that do not leverage monotonic structures.

Conclusion: Integrating data-aware modeling into traditional optimization algorithms like POA is feasible and impactful, especially under structural constraints such as monotonicity and homogeneity.

Abstract: Monotone optimisation problems admit specialised global solvers such as the Polyblock Outer Approximation (POA) algorithm, but these methods typically require explicit objective and constraint functions. In many applications, these functions are only available through data, making POA difficult to apply directly. We introduce an algorithm-aware learning approach that integrates learned models into POA by directly predicting its projection primitive via the radial inverse, avoiding the costly bisection procedure used in standard POA. We propose Homogeneous-Monotone Radial Inverse (HM-RI) networks, structured neural architectures that enforce key monotonicity and homogeneity properties, enabling fast projection estimation. We provide a theoretical characterisation of radial inverse functions and show that, under mild structural conditions, a HM-RI predictor corresponds to the radial inverse of a valid set of monotone constraints. To reduce training overhead, we further develop relaxed monotonicity conditions that remain compatible with POA. Across multiple monotone optimisation benchmarks (indefinite quadratic programming, multiplicative programming, and transmit power optimisation), our approach yields substantial speed-ups in comparison to direct function estimation while maintaining strong solution quality, outperforming baselines that do not exploit monotonic structure.

*Xinwei Qiang,Hongmin Chen,Shixuan Sun,Jingwen Leng,Xin Liu,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DASH, a scheduling strategy to improve throughput in deterministic attention operations during LLM training, achieving up to 1.28x performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the steep performance costs associated with deterministic operations in LLM training, particularly in attention backward pass.

Method: Proposed DASH, which uses Descending Q-Tile Iteration strategy and Shift Scheduling as two scheduling solutions for optimal DAG-based compute-resource utilization.

Result: Evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs showed DASH reduced pipeline stalls and improved throughput by up to 1.28x.

Conclusion: DASH enhances the efficiency of deterministic processes in LLM training, aiding reproducibility and addressing hardware underutilization issues.

Abstract: Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization.
  To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks.
  Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in robotic control systems regarding sensory state organization and action planning through active inference and reinforcement learning.

Method: Formal abstraction of reinforcement learning methods combining model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches with active inference.

Result: Enables sample efficiency and accessibility of active inference within distributional reinforcement learning, enhancing performance.

Conclusion: Active inference can improve reinforcement learning efficiency and capability in solving complex problems without transition dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Optimal control of complex environments with robotic systems faces two complementary and intertwined challenges: efficient organization of sensory state information and far-sighted action planning. Because the reinforcement learning framework addresses only the latter, it tends to deliver sample-inefficient solutions. Active inference is the state-of-the-art process theory that explains how biological brains handle this dual problem. However, its applications to artificial intelligence have thus far been limited to extensions of existing model-based approaches. We present a formal abstraction of reinforcement learning algorithms that spans model-based, distributional, and model-free approaches. This abstraction seamlessly integrates active inference into the distributional reinforcement learning framework, making its performance advantages accessible without transition dynamics modeling.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pre-trained encoder for global child development, making machine learning feasible even in data-scarce regions, achieving superior performance in child development prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of sufficient data that prevents effective machine learning implementations for monitoring global child development in resource-limited settings.

Method: They developed a pre-trained encoder using data from 357,709 children across 44 countries (UNICEF survey data), enabling few-shot learning and zero-shot deployment for child development prediction.

Result: The encoder outperformed traditional gradient boosting models, achieving AUC scores of 0.65 with 50 samples, 0.73 with 500 samples, and up to 0.84 in zero-shot deployment to unseen countries.

Conclusion: Pre-trained encoders significantly improve the accuracy and feasibility of ML applications for child development monitoring in resource-constrained environments and advance SDG 4.2.1 goals.

Abstract: A large number of children experience preventable developmental delays each year, yet the deployment of machine learning in new countries has been stymied by a data bottleneck: reliable models require thousands of samples, while new programs begin with fewer than 100. We introduce the first pre-trained encoder for global child development, trained on 357,709 children across 44 countries using UNICEF survey data. With only 50 training samples, the pre-trained encoder achieves an average AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), outperforming cold-start gradient boosting at 0.61 by 8-12% across regions. At N=500, the encoder achieves an AUC of 0.73. Zero-shot deployment to unseen countries achieves AUCs up to 0.84. We apply a transfer learning bound to explain why pre-training diversity enables few-shot generalization. These results establish that pre-trained encoders can transform the feasibility of ML for SDG 4.2.1 monitoring in resource-constrained settings.

### [188] [Top-k on a Budget: Adaptive Ranking with Weak and Strong Oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20989)
*Lutz Oettershagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of identifying top-k items using two types of oracles: a noisy, fast weak oracle and a high-cost, precise strong oracle. It proposes and analyzes adaptive algorithms to efficiently minimize strong oracle queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency in identifying top-k items when exact evaluations are costly and precise resources (strong oracle) are limited. This is relevant in scenarios where quick but noisy evaluations are available but high precision is limited or expensive.

Method: The paper first analyzes a baseline approach, Screen-Then-Certify (STC), and proves the limits on strong oracle calls. It then proposes two adaptive algorithms: ACE, focusing strong oracle queries on boundary items, and ACE-W, which extends ACE by allocating weak oracle resources adaptively in two phases.

Result: The proposed algorithms, ACE and ACE-W, achieve significant reductions in strong oracle queries compared to baseline methods, while maintaining performance guarantees under weak uncertainty.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that through adaptive allocation of weak and strong oracle queries, the computational and resource cost of identifying top-k items can be significantly reduced.

Abstract: Identifying the top-$k$ items is fundamental but often prohibitive when exact valuations are expensive. We study a two-oracle setting with a fast, noisy weak oracle and a scarce, high-fidelity strong oracle (e.g., human expert verification or expensive simulation). We first analyze a simple screen-then-certify baseline (STC) and prove it makes at most $m(4\varepsilon_{\max})$ strong calls given jointly valid weak confidence intervals with maximum radius $\varepsilon_{\max}$, where $m(\cdot)$ denotes the near-tie mass around the top-$k$ threshold. We establish a conditional lower bound of $Ω(m(\varepsilon_{\max}))$ for any algorithm given the same weak uncertainty. Our main contribution is ACE, an adaptive certification algorithm that focuses strong queries on critical boundary items, achieving the same $O(m(4\varepsilon_{\max}))$ bound while reducing strong calls in practice. We then introduce ACE-W, a fully adaptive two-phase method that allocates weak budget adaptively before running ACE, further reducing strong costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates energy consumption in machine learning models, presenting measurements across tasks, models, and GPUs, and introducing a framework for diagnosing energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize machine learning operations by understanding and diagnosing variations in energy consumption, especially with growing computational intensity.

Method: A large-scale measurement study of energy and inference times across 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 configurations, followed by a reasoning framework for energy consumption analysis.

Result: Significant variations in energy consumption demonstrated (e.g., LLM task types ranging 25×, video vs. image generation at 100×) and correlations to utilization and latent metrics identified.

Conclusion: Time and energy consumption rely on latent metrics and are influenced by cross-layer factors, providing pathways to optimize energy use in datacenters.

Abstract: Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.

*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces architecture-conditioned scaling laws for language models, finding width should increase faster than depth and identifying the critical depth phenomenon where increased depth beyond a certain limit worsens performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to refine neural scaling laws by incorporating the dependence on architectural factors like depth and width of models to optimize their performance.

Method: The authors propose depth-width scaling laws and validate them empirically using 30 transformer architectures trained at different parameter scales from 17M to 7B.

Result: Key finding includes that width grows faster than depth (optimal scaling as W ~ C^0.34, D ~ C^0.12). Additionally, exceeding critical depth decreases model performance despite parameter growth.

Conclusion: Optimal depth-width tradeoffs maintain relevance at production scale, and exceeding critical depth has detrimental effects on model performance.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how language model loss decreases with parameters and data, but treat architecture as interchangeable--a billion parameters could arise from a shallow-wide model (10 layers & 8,192 hidden dimension) or a deep-narrow one (80 layers & 2,048 hidden dimension). We propose architecture-conditioned scaling laws decomposing this dependence, finding that optimal depth scales as D* ~ C^0.12 while optimal width scales as W* ~ C^0.34, meaning width should grow 2.8x faster than depth. We discover a critical depth phenomenon: beyond D_crit ~ W^0.44 (sublinear in W), adding layers increases loss despite adding parameters--the Depth Delusion. Empirically, we validate these findings across 30 transformer architectures spanning 17M to 7B parameters, each trained on representative high-compute samples, achieving R^2 = 0.922. Our central finding: at 7B scale, a 64-layer model (6.38B params) underperforms a 32-layer model (6.86B params) by 0.12 nats, despite being significantly deeper. This demonstrates that optimal depth-width tradeoffs persist at the production scale.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MADE, a framework for benchmarking autonomous materials discovery pipelines by simulating real-world iterative discovery tasks and testing their efficacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional materials discovery benchmarks focus on static tasks and fail to represent adaptive, iterative discovery processes. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing a framework for end-to-end pipeline benchmarking.

Method: The authors developed MADE, which simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns under resource constraints and allows for the composition of discovery agents using various interchangeable components like generative models and planners.

Result: They systematically experimented across various systems to evaluate workflows, analyze component performance, and assess the scalability of methods with system complexity.

Conclusion: MADE provides a flexible and effective framework to benchmark and enhance materials discovery pipelines, supporting both fixed and adaptive systems.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for computational materials discovery primarily evaluate static predictive tasks or isolated computational sub-tasks. While valuable, these evaluations neglect the inherently iterative and adaptive nature of scientific discovery. We introduce MAterials Discovery Environments (MADE), a novel framework for benchmarking end-to-end autonomous materials discovery pipelines. MADE simulates closed-loop discovery campaigns in which an agent or algorithm proposes, evaluates, and refines candidate materials under a constrained oracle budget, capturing the sequential and resource-limited nature of real discovery workflows. We formalize discovery as a search for thermodynamically stable compounds relative to a given convex hull, and evaluate efficacy and efficiency via comparison to baseline algorithms. The framework is flexible; users can compose discovery agents from interchangeable components such as generative models, filters, and planners, enabling the study of arbitrary workflows ranging from fixed pipelines to fully agentic systems with tool use and adaptive decision making. We demonstrate this by conducting systematic experiments across a family of systems, enabling ablation of components in discovery pipelines, and comparison of how methods scale with system complexity.

*Ruicheng Ao,David Simchi-Levi,Xinshang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper critiques current LLM benchmarks for Operations Research (OR) that overlook iterative debugging processes and introduces new evaluative benchmarks to assess models within diagnostic feedback loops, demonstrating superior results using targeted training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs in OR often treat tasks as one-shot static processes, ignoring iterative debugging practices such as repairing infeasible models with domain-specific tools like solvers and IIS analysis. Thus, this paper aims to bridge this practical gap.

Method: The authors introduce two benchmarks: ORDebug and ORBias. ORDebug assesses iterative diagnostic self-correction using 5,000+ problems with varied error types, while ORBias evaluates models on systematic rationality biases using 2,000 instances, comparing in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases.

Result: On ORDebug, iterative RLVR-trained models surpassed traditional APIs, achieving a 95.3% recovery rate (+9.1%), 62.4% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6%), and 1.7x faster resolutions. On ORBias, curriculum training reduced systematic bias by 48% and achieved the only negative bias drift on ID → OOD (-9.6%).

Conclusion: Using benchmarks that simulate real diagnostic practices and feedback improves LLM performance in Operations Research. Targeted, domain-specific training could outperform simple scaling approaches, with measurable reductions in inefficiency and bias.

Abstract: Operations Research practitioners routinely debug infeasible models through an iterative process: analyzing Irreducible Infeasible Subsystems (\IIS{}), identifying constraint conflicts, and systematically repairing formulations until feasibility is achieved. Yet existing LLM benchmarks evaluate OR as one-shot translation -- given a problem description, generate solver code -- ignoring this diagnostic loop entirely. We introduce two benchmarks that place the \textbf{solver in the evaluation loop}. \textbf{\ORDebug{}} evaluates iterative self-correction through 5,000+ problems spanning 9 error types; each repair action triggers solver re-execution and \IIS{} recomputation, providing deterministic, verifiable feedback. \textbf{\ORBias{}} evaluates behavioral rationality through 2,000 newsvendor instances (1,000 ID + 1,000 OOD), measuring systematic deviations from closed-form optimal policies. Across 26 models and 12,000+ samples, we find that domain-specific RLVR training enables an 8B model to surpass frontier APIs: 95.3\% vs 86.2\% recovery rate (+9.1\%), 62.4\% vs 47.8\% diagnostic accuracy (+14.6\%), and 2.25 vs 3.78 steps to resolution (1.7$\times$ faster). On \ORBias{}, curriculum training achieves the only negative ID$\rightarrow$OOD bias drift among models evaluated (-9.6\%), reducing systematic bias by 48\% (from 20.0\% to 10.4\%). These results demonstrate that process-level evaluation with verifiable oracles enables targeted training that outperforms scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce human bias and mitigate reward hacking in MetaBBO by leveraging LLMs for auto-design of reward functions.

Method: The authors propose a tailored evolution paradigm for iterative improvement and a multi-task evolution architecture for parallel reward discovery and knowledge sharing.

Result: The approach demonstrated effectiveness in discovering useful reward functions, enhancing the performance of existing MetaBBO frameworks.

Conclusion: This paper highlights the value of automated reward design using LLMs, showing its potential to improve MetaBBO optimization outcomes.

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) is an emerging avenue within Optimization community, where algorithm design policy could be meta-learned by reinforcement learning to enhance optimization performance. So far, the reward functions in existing MetaBBO works are designed by human experts, introducing certain design bias and risks of reward hacking. In this paper, we use Large Language Model~(LLM) as an automated reward discovery tool for MetaBBO. Specifically, we consider both effectiveness and efficiency sides. On effectiveness side, we borrow the idea of evolution of heuristics, introducing tailored evolution paradigm in the iterative LLM-based program search process, which ensures continuous improvement. On efficiency side, we additionally introduce multi-task evolution architecture to support parallel reward discovery for diverse MetaBBO approaches. Such parallel process also benefits from knowledge sharing across tasks to accelerate convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that the reward functions discovered by our approach could be helpful for boosting existing MetaBBO works, underscoring the importance of reward design in MetaBBO.

Result: OATTA delivers universal improvement in tasks like image classification, physiological signal analysis, and sentiment analysis, boosting accuracy by up to 6.35% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: OATTA effectively demonstrates the critical role of temporal modeling in TTA, offering a lightweight, generalizable approach for handling real-world distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enables pre-trained models to adjust to distribution shift by learning from unlabeled test-time streams. However, existing methods typically treat these streams as independent samples, overlooking the supervisory signal inherent in temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce Order-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (OATTA). We formulate test-time adaptation as a gradient-free recursive Bayesian estimation task, using a learned dynamic transition matrix as a temporal prior to refine the base model's predictions. To ensure safety in weakly structured streams, we introduce a likelihood-ratio gate (LLR) that reverts to the base predictor when temporal evidence is absent. OATTA is a lightweight, model-agnostic module that incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments across image classification, wearable and physiological signal analysis, and language sentiment analysis demonstrate its universality; OATTA consistently boosts established baselines, improving accuracy by up to 6.35%. Our findings establish that modeling temporal dynamics provides a critical, orthogonal signal beyond standard order-agnostic TTA approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the unsustainable energy growth of AI, leading to exploration of alternative neuromorphic and physics-based methods for realistic computing architectures.

Method: Researchers trained an XY model using equilibrium propagation on locally connected lattice architectures, analyzing its performance on various benchmark tasks.

Result: Sparse, locally connected networks demonstrated comparable performance to dense networks in benchmark tasks, proving the feasibility of using such architectures.

Conclusion: Equilibrium propagation is effective in sparse, locally connected architectures, offering scalable alternatives to dense networks for practical AI applications.

Abstract: The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has led to an unsustainable growth in energy consumption. This has motivated progress in neuromorphic computing and physics-based training of learning machines as alternatives to digital neural networks. Many theoretical studies focus on simple architectures like all-to-all or densely connected layered networks. However, these may be challenging to realize experimentally, e.g. due to connectivity constraints. In this work, we investigate the performance of the widespread physics-based training method of equilibrium propagation for more realistic architectural choices, specifically, locally connected lattices. We train an XY model and explore the influence of architecture on various benchmark tasks, tracking the evolution of spatially distributed responses and couplings during training. Our results show that sparse networks with only local connections can achieve performance comparable to dense networks. Our findings provide guidelines for further scaling up architectures based on equilibrium propagation in realistic settings.

### [196] [Conditional Denoising Model as a Physical Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21021)
*José Afonso,Pedro Viegas,Rodrigo Ventura,Vasco Guerra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Conditional Denoising Model (CDM), a generative model for surrogate modeling, addressing the trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency, achieving strict adherence to governing equations without explicit physics losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the limitations in existing surrogate modeling methods, which struggle between accuracy and ensuring adherence to physical constraints.

Method: The Conditional Denoising Model (CDM) is proposed, which restores clean states from noisy inputs, learning a vector field to project data onto a valid physical solution space using fixed-point iteration.

Result: CDM demonstrates higher parameter and data efficiency on a plasma physics benchmark, strictly adhering to physical constraints despite not being trained with explicit physics losses.

Conclusion: The CDM showcases that a denoising objective effectively regularizes the model, ensuring superior physical consistency and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling for complex physical systems typically faces a trade-off between data-fitting accuracy and physical consistency. Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses.

TL;DR: SIGMA-PPG is a novel foundation model for photoplethysmography signals that addresses noise and redundancy with a robust masking mechanism and semantic consistency constraint. It outperforms current baselines on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing photoplethysmography models struggle due to noise and redundancy, leading to challenges in achieving meaningful morphological precision and avoiding trivial masked modeling solutions.

Method: The proposed SIGMA-PPG employs a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism driven by reinforcement learning and statistical priors, along with a vector quantization-based semantic consistency framework to enhance codebook density and prevent redundant features.

Result: SIGMA-PPG was pre-trained on 120,000+ hours of data, surpassing five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SIGMA-PPG represents a leap forward in foundation models for PPG processing, offering enhanced robustness and precision. The code for this model is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Current foundation model for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals is challenged by the intrinsic redundancy and noise of the signal. Standard masked modeling often yields trivial solutions while contrastive methods lack morphological precision. To address these limitations, we propose a Statistical-prior Informed Generative Masking Architecture (SIGMA-PPG), a generative foundation model featuring a Prior-Guided Adversarial Masking mechanism, where a reinforcement learning-driven teacher leverages statistical priors to create challenging learning paths that prevent overfitting to noise. We also incorporate a semantic consistency constraint via vector quantization to ensure that physiologically identical waveforms (even those altered by recording artifacts or minor perturbations) map to shared indices. This enhances codebook semantic density and eliminates redundant feature structures. Pre-trained on over 120,000 hours of data, SIGMA-PPG achieves superior average performance compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across 12 diverse downstream tasks.

*Omer Rochman-Sharabi,Gilles Louppe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a constrained sampling framework for neural emulators using diffusion models to ensure physical laws and constraints are met during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla neural emulators often fail to guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction, making them unreliable for scientific purposes.

Method: The authors propose the Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR) algorithm, which iteratively alternates between denoising predictions, projecting onto feasible constraint sets, and renoising, while employing a constrained forward process to only diffuse over constraint-satisfying samples.

Result: Their approach significantly reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude, enhances sample consistency, and better aligns with the true constrained distributions in experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and weather forecasting.

Conclusion: The PPR algorithm provides a robust solution for enforcing hard constraints in neural emulators, making them more reliable and better suited for scientific applications.

Abstract: Neural emulators based on diffusion models show promise for scientific applications, but vanilla models cannot guarantee physical accuracy or constraint satisfaction. We address this by introducing a constrained sampling framework that enforces hard constraints, such as physical laws or observational consistency, at generation time. Our approach defines a constrained forward process that diffuses only over the feasible set of constraint-satisfying samples, inducing constrained marginal distributions. To reverse this, we propose Predict-Project-Renoise (PPR), an iterative algorithm that samples from the constrained marginals by alternating between denoising predictions, projecting onto the feasible set, and renoising. Experiments on 2D distributions, PDEs, and global weather forecasting demonstrate that PPR reduces constraint violations by over an order of magnitude while improving sample consistency and better matching the true constrained distribution compared to baselines.

*Chengzu Li,Zanyi Wang,Jiaang Li,Yi Xu,Han Zhou,Huanyu Zhang,Ruichuan An,Dengyang Jiang,Zhaochong An,Ivan Vulić,Serge Belongie,Anna Korhonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to visual reasoning by using video generation models as intermediate steps for reasoning and demonstrates strong generalization and scaling capabilities in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing vision-language models in fine-grained spatial understanding and dynamic action planning, rethinking visual reasoning by leveraging video generation as a dynamic solution.

Method: The method involves utilizing video generation models that simulate intermediate reasoning steps to solve tasks like maze navigation and tangram puzzles, focusing on generalization and consistent spatial planning.

Result: Key findings include robust zero-shot generalization, effective use of visual context for reasoning, and a test-time scaling law that improves model performance as video length increases for complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The study concludes that video generation can act as a powerful and generalizable paradigm for complex visual reasoning, extending beyond its media tool roots to a reasoning framework.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have excelled at textual reasoning, but they often struggle with fine-grained spatial understanding and continuous action planning, failing to simulate the dynamics required for complex visual reasoning. In this work, we formulate visual reasoning by means of video generation models, positing that generated frames can act as intermediate reasoning steps between initial states and solutions. We evaluate their capacity in two distinct regimes: Maze Navigation for sequential discrete planning with low visual change and Tangram Puzzle for continuous manipulation with high visual change. Our experiments reveal three critical insights: (1) Robust Zero-Shot Generalization: In both tasks, the model demonstrates strong performance on unseen data distributions without specific finetuning. (2) Visual Context: The model effectively uses visual context as explicit control, such as agent icons and tangram shapes, enabling it to maintain high visual consistency and adapt its planning capability robustly to unseen patterns. (3) Visual Test-Time Scaling: We observe a test-time scaling law in sequential planning; increasing the generated video length (visual inference budget) empowers better zero-shot generalization to spatially and temporally complex paths. These findings suggest that video generation is not merely a media tool, but a scalable, generalizable paradigm for visual reasoning.

*Elizabeth L. Baker,Alexander Denker,Jes Frellsen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work extends score-based diffusion models to function spaces for sampling from posterior distributions, proposing a method to stabilize posterior sampling in Bayesian inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of conditioning score-based diffusion models in function spaces for Bayesian inverse problems and provide a theoretical foundation for posterior sampling.

Method: The paper introduces an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform to condition diffusion models, and develops a simulation-free score matching objective called Supervised Guidance Training.

Result: The proposed method enables efficient and accurate posterior sampling for Bayesian inverse problems using diffusion models, overcoming intractable elements in the guidance term.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel and practical framework for fine-tuning diffusion models in function spaces, contributing to improved posterior sampling methods for Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have recently been extended to infinite-dimensional function spaces, with uses such as inverse problems arising from partial differential equations. In the Bayesian formulation of inverse problems, the aim is to sample from a posterior distribution over functions obtained by conditioning a prior on noisy observations. While diffusion models provide expressive priors in function space, the theory of conditioning them to sample from the posterior remains open. We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term. As the guidance term is intractable, we propose a simulation-free score matching objective (called Supervised Guidance Training) enabling efficient and stable posterior sampling. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples on Bayesian inverse problems in function spaces. In summary, our work offers the first function-space method for fine-tuning trained diffusion models to accurately sample from a posterior.

### [201] [Test-Time Adaptation for Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21048)
*Yiqiao Liao,Farinaz Koushanfar,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TACO, a framework that combines generalization-focused and instance-specific approaches in unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) to combine their strengths and improve instance-wise adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCO approaches are split into efficient, generalizable models and adaptable, instance-specific models. However, these two paradigms lack effective integration, leading to inefficiencies in combining adaptability with learned inductive structures.

Method: The authors propose TACO, a test-time adaptation framework that strategically relaxes trained parameters to preserve learned biases while allowing rapid adaptation. This approach leverages warm-starting to bridge the gap between generalization and instance-specific optimization.

Result: TACO achieves improved solution quality with negligible computational overhead, outperforming both naive fine-tuning of generalist models and scratch optimization of instance-specific models. Its effectiveness was demonstrated on Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique problems across various settings.

Conclusion: TACO serves as a practical framework for unsupervised NCO by effectively integrating generalization and instance-wise adaptability, showcasing robustness and improved performance on classical optimization problems.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) enables learning powerful solvers without access to ground-truth solutions. Existing approaches fall into two disjoint paradigms: models trained for generalization across instances, and instance-specific models optimized independently at test time. While the former are efficient during inference, they lack effective instance-wise adaptability; the latter are flexible but fail to exploit learned inductive structure and are prone to poor local optima. This motivates the central question of our work: how can we leverage the inductive bias learned through generalization while unlocking the flexibility required for effective instance-wise adaptation? We first identify a challenge in bridging these two paradigms: generalization-focused models often constitute poor warm starts for instance-wise optimization, potentially underperforming even randomly initialized models when fine-tuned at test time. To resolve this incompatibility, we propose TACO, a model-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that unifies and extends the two existing paradigms for unsupervised NCO. TACO applies strategic warm-starting to partially relax trained parameters while preserving inductive bias, enabling rapid and effective unsupervised adaptation. Crucially, compared to naively fine-tuning a trained generalizable model or optimizing an instance-specific model from scratch, TACO achieves better solution quality while incurring negligible additional computational cost. Experiments on canonical CO problems, Minimum Vertex Cover and Maximum Clique, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TACO across static, distribution-shifted, and dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, establishing it as a practical bridge between generalizable and instance-specific unsupervised NCO.

### [202] [SMKC: Sketch Based Kernel Correlation Images for Variable Cardinality Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21050)
*Haokun Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMKC, a framework for anomaly detection in multivariate time series under sensor churn conditions, achieving robust results and practical applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods assume a static set of variables, which fails in dynamic operational environments with changing sensors.

Method: SMKC uses permutation-invariant feature hashing to fix input size and employs hybrid kernel images for temporal structure detection, coupled with a teacher-student learning approach.

Result: SMKC's representation proves effective, performing well even without full model training and showing potential for practical use in constrained settings.

Conclusion: The SMKC framework demonstrates resilience to sensor churn and presents a robust baseline for anomaly detection without requiring intensive training.

Abstract: Conventional anomaly detection in multivariate time series relies on the assumption that the set of observed variables remains static. In operational environments, however, monitoring systems frequently experience sensor churn. Signals may appear, disappear, or be renamed, creating data windows where the cardinality varies and may include values unseen during training. To address this challenge, we propose SMKC, a framework that decouples the dynamic input structure from the anomaly detector. We first employ permutation-invariant feature hashing to sketch raw inputs into a fixed size state sequence. We then construct a hybrid kernel image to capture global temporal structure through pairwise comparisons of the sequence and its derivatives. The model learns normal patterns using masked reconstruction and a teacher-student prediction objective. Our evaluation reveals that robust log-distance channels provide the primary discriminative signal, whereas cosine representations often fail to capture sufficient contrast. Notably, we find that a detector using random projections and nearest neighbors on the SMKC representation performs competitively with fully trained baselines without requiring gradient updates. This highlights the effectiveness of the representation itself and offers a practical cold-start solution for resource-constrained deployments.

Conclusion: Snowball provides a scalable and efficient digital solution for combinatorial optimization, offering notable improvements over existing Ising machine implementations.

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as accelerators for combinatorial optimization. To enable practical deployment, this work aims to reduce time-to-solution by addressing three challenges: (1) hardware topology, (2) spin selection and update algorithms, and (3) scalable coupling-coefficient precision. Restricted topologies require minor embedding; naive parallel updates can oscillate or stall; and limited precision can preclude feasible mappings or degrade solution quality.
  This work presents Snowball, a digital, scalable, all-to-all coupled Ising machine that integrates dual-mode Markov chain Monte Carlo spin selection with asynchronous spin updates to promote convergence and reduce time-to-solution. The digital architecture supports wide, configurable coupling precision, unlike many analog realizations at high bit widths. A prototype on an AMD Alveo U250 accelerator card achieves an 8$\times$ reduction in time-to-solution relative to a state-of-the-art Ising machine on the same benchmark instance.

*Alexandre Larouche,Audrey Durand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SUBo-GFN, a GFlowNet that leverages submodular rewards for efficient training and improved performance in distribution matching and candidate generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generative models like GFlowNets by leveraging submodular structures in reward functions, enabling efficient sampling of compositional objects.

Method: The authors propose SUBo-GFN, which employs submodular upper bounds on rewards to optimize GFlowNet training based on the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle.

Result: SUBo-GFN generates significantly more training data with fewer reward evaluations, showing enhanced performance on submodular synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating submodular structures into GFlowNets improves training efficiency and performance in compositional object generation.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a class of generative models that learn to sample compositional objects proportionally to their a priori unknown value, their reward. We focus on the case where the reward has a specified, actionable structure, namely that it is submodular. We show submodularity can be harnessed to retrieve upper bounds on the reward of compositional objects that have not yet been observed. We provide in-depth analyses of the probability of such bounds occurring, as well as how many unobserved compositional objects can be covered by a bound. Following the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty principle, we then introduce SUBo-GFN, which uses the submodular upper bounds to train a GFN. We show that SUBo-GFN generates orders of magnitude more training data than classical GFNs for the same number of queries to the reward function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SUBo-GFN in terms of distribution matching and high-quality candidate generation on synthetic and real-world submodular tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a human-LLM collaborative framework to improve feature engineering in tabular learning, separating operation proposal from selection and incorporating human feedback for better decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are widely used to automate feature engineering, but existing methods rely on LLMs as black-box systems which can lack effective operation selection strategies.

Method: The framework decouples proposal and selection processes, using LLMs to generate candidates. A mechanism models utility and uncertainty while incorporating expert human feedback to refine operation choices.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show improved feature engineering performance and reduced cognitive load for users using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The collaborative framework enhances tabular learning workflows by combining LLM capabilities with human expertise, optimizing the feature engineering process.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate feature engineering in tabular learning. Given task-specific information, LLMs can propose diverse feature transformation operations to enhance downstream model performance. However, current approaches typically assign the LLM as a black-box optimizer, responsible for both proposing and selecting operations based solely on its internal heuristics, which often lack calibrated estimations of operation utility and consequently lead to repeated exploration of low-yield operations without a principled strategy for prioritizing promising directions. In this paper, we propose a human-LLM collaborative feature engineering framework for tabular learning. We begin by decoupling the transformation operation proposal and selection processes, where LLMs are used solely to generate operation candidates, while the selection is guided by explicitly modeling the utility and uncertainty of each proposed operation. Since accurate utility estimation can be difficult especially in the early rounds of feature engineering, we design a mechanism within the framework that selectively elicits and incorporates human expert preference feedback, comparing which operations are more promising, into the selection process to help identify more effective operations. Our evaluations on both the synthetic study and the real user study demonstrate that the proposed framework improves feature engineering performance across a variety of tabular datasets and reduces users' cognitive load during the feature engineering process.

*Augusto Santos,Teresa Santos,Catarina Rodrigues,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel machine learning method for early detection of emergent phenomena like seizures or customer churn by uncovering latent causal structures in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent phenomena often arise from hidden causal interactions in systems that are difficult to understand due to unknown or partially observed data-generating processes.

Method: The proposed method learns an optimal feature representation from estimators based on powers of empirical covariance or precision matrices, coupled with a supervised learning module for classification and explainability.

Result: The approach achieves competitive results in seizure detection and customer churn prediction, demonstrating empirical soundness and structural consistency.

Conclusion: The method balances predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure, advancing toward both explainability and effective prediction of critical events.

Abstract: Emergent phenomena -- onset of epileptic seizures, sudden customer churn, or pandemic outbreaks -- often arise from hidden causal interactions in complex systems. We propose a machine learning method for their early detection that addresses a core challenge: unveiling and harnessing a system's latent causal structure despite the data-generating process being unknown and partially observed. The method learns an optimal feature representation from a one-parameter family of estimators -- powers of the empirical covariance or precision matrix -- offering a principled way to tune in to the underlying structure driving the emergence of critical events. A supervised learning module then classifies the learned representation. We prove structural consistency of the family and demonstrate the empirical soundness of our approach on seizure detection and churn prediction, attaining competitive results in both. Beyond prediction, and toward explainability, we ascertain that the optimal covariance power exhibits evidence of good identifiability while capturing structural signatures, thus reconciling predictive performance with interpretable statistical structure.

*Minghui Chen,Wenlong Deng,James Zou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method, Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), to address performance degradation in deep compound AI systems with long workflows by using local optimization and controlled adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in deep compound AI systems where standard feedback methods degrade performance as system depth increases, specifically addressing issues like exploding or vanishing textual gradients.

Method: Introduces TEP, a method inspired by equilibrium propagation, consisting of free and nudged phases for local prompt refinement and controlled task-level adaptation.

Result: TEP outperforms global textual propagation methods like TextGrad in long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use datasets, improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: TEP enables scalable and practical optimization of deep compound AI systems by mitigating feedback challenges and supporting depth-increasing workflows without compromising the use of black-box LLM components.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as part of compound AI systems that coordinate multiple modules (e.g., retrievers, tools, verifiers) over long-horizon workflows. Recent approaches that propagate textual feedback globally (e.g., TextGrad) make it feasible to optimize such pipelines, but we find that performance degrades as system depth grows. In particular, long-horizon agentic workflows exhibit two depth-scaling failure modes: 1) exploding textual gradient, where textual feedback grows exponentially with depth, leading to prohibitively long message and amplifies evaluation biases; and 2) vanishing textual gradient, where limited long-context ability causes models overemphasize partial feedback and compression of lengthy feedback causes downstream messages to lose specificity gradually as they propagate many hops upstream. To mitigate these issues, we introduce Textual Equilibrium Propagation (TEP), a local learning principle inspired by Equilibrium Propagation in energy-based models. TEP includes two phases: 1) a free phase where a local LLM critics iteratively refine prompts until reaching equilibrium (no further improvements are suggested); and 2) a nudged phase which applies proximal prompt edits with bounded modification intensity, using task-level objectives that propagate via forward signaling rather than backward feedback chains. This design supports local prompt optimization followed by controlled adaptation toward global goals without the computational burden and signal degradation of global textual backpropagation. Across long-horizon QA benchmarks and multi-agent tool-use dataset, TEP consistently improves accuracy and efficiency over global propagation methods such as TextGrad. The gains grows with depth, while preserving the practicality of black-box LLM components in deep compound AI system.

*Anders Gjølbye,Ida Kargaard,Emma Kargaard,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Partial Least Squares (PLS) under missing data scenarios and proposes a phase transition for its effectiveness based on signal-to-noise threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal datasets often face challenges like missing entries in paired data, and understanding the behavior of PLS in such cases is crucial for its application.

Method: The authors investigated PLS under high-dimensional spiked models and modeled missing data as random masking, utilizing normalization techniques and deriving formulations for singular vector alignment.

Result: PLS exhibits a BBP-like phase transition, where its effectiveness depends on whether the signal-to-noise ratio crosses a critical threshold. Formulas for asymptotic overlaps and impacts of masking were derived.

Conclusion: PLS can recover meaningful shared directions from multimodal datasets under missing data conditions, provided signals surpass specific thresholds; experimental results support their theoretical insights.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) learns shared structure from paired data via the top singular vectors of the empirical cross-covariance (PLS-SVD), but multimodal datasets often have missing entries in both views. We study PLS-SVD under independent entry-wise missing-completely-at-random masking in a proportional high-dimensional spiked model. After appropriate normalization, the masked cross-covariance behaves like a spiked rectangular random matrix whose effective signal strength is attenuated by $\sqrtρ$, where $ρ$ is the joint entry retention probability. As a result, PLS-SVD exhibits a sharp BBP-type phase transition: below a critical signal-to-noise threshold the leading singular vectors are asymptotically uninformative, while above it they achieve nontrivial alignment with the latent shared directions, with closed-form asymptotic overlap formulas. Simulations and semi-synthetic multimodal experiments corroborate the predicted phase diagram and recovery curves across aspect ratios, signal strengths, and missingness levels.

TL;DR: This survey analyzes the challenges and strategies for addressing distribution shifts in graph foundation models (GFMs) and offers insights into OOD generalization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph learning models often struggle with generalization when encountering distribution shifts such as structure changes or new task domains. GFMs aim to address these challenges via large-scale pretraining.

Method: The paper reviews the challenges associated with distribution shifts, categorizes approaches based on fixed or heterogeneous task specifications, and summarizes strategies and pretraining objectives for OOD generalization in GFMs.

Result: It provides a comprehensive review of strategies for OOD generalization in GFMs, offering a unified problem setting and categorization of existing approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first survey to explore OOD generalization in GFMs, highlighting challenges, evaluation protocols, and future research directions.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental data structure for representing relational information in domains such as social networks, molecular systems, and knowledge graphs. However, graph learning models often suffer from limited generalization when applied beyond their training distributions. In practice, distribution shifts may arise from changes in graph structure, domain semantics, available modalities, or task formulations. To address these challenges, graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged, aiming to learn general-purpose representations through large-scale pretraining across diverse graphs and tasks. In this survey, we review recent progress on GFMs from the perspective of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We first discuss the main challenges posed by distribution shifts in graph learning and outline a unified problem setting. We then organize existing approaches based on whether they are designed to operate under a fixed task specification or to support generalization across heterogeneous task formulations, and summarize the corresponding OOD handling strategies and pretraining objectives. Finally, we review common evaluation protocols and discuss open directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first survey for OOD generalization in GFMs.

Motivation: There is a need to address the fundamental challenge of non-contraction in average-reward Markov decision processes efficiently, as existing methods rely on strong assumptions or are suboptimal in sample complexity.

Method: The authors propose a simple variant of Q-learning using a 'lazified dynamics' approach, where the system occasionally stays in the current state, coupled with an instance-dependent seminorm to establish one-step contraction.

Result: The proposed method achieves optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees, significantly improving efficiency under the reachability assumption.

Conclusion: The use of lazy transformations and instance-dependent seminorms effectively addresses non-contraction challenges in Q-learning, producing optimal results for average-reward Markov decision processes.

Abstract: We present the convergence rates of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning for average-reward Markov decision processes, where the absence of contraction poses a fundamental challenge. Existing non-asymptotic results overcome this challenge by either imposing strong assumptions to enforce seminorm contraction or relying on discounted or episodic Markov decision processes as successive approximations, which either require unknown parameters or result in suboptimal sample complexity. In this work, under a reachability assumption, we establish optimal $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity guarantees (up to logarithmic factors) for a simple variant of synchronous and asynchronous Q-learning that samples from the lazified dynamics, where the system remains in the current state with some fixed probability. At the core of our analysis is the construction of an instance-dependent seminorm and showing that, after a lazy transformation of the Markov decision process, the Bellman operator becomes one-step contractive under this seminorm.

*Shivam Patel,William Cocke,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOCUS, an attention-based method for creating low-dimensional embeddings to summarize language model capabilities efficiently and foster diverse applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing the vast and dynamic array of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to their increasing complexity and number.

Method: LOCUS uses an attention-based deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores to generate embeddings, without retraining models. Additionally, it employs a correctness predictor for accurate query routing.

Result: LOCUS requires significantly fewer query samples than other methods (up to 4.8x fewer) while producing robust embeddings that reflect model similarity and enable versatile downstream applications.

Conclusion: LOCUS is an effective method for managing LLMs, allowing seamless integration of new models, enhancing routing accuracy, and enabling diverse applications such as model comparison, portfolio selection, and clustering.

Abstract: The rapidly growing ecosystem of Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it increasingly challenging to manage and utilize the vast and dynamic pool of models effectively. We propose LOCUS, a method that produces low-dimensional vector embeddings that compactly represent a language model's capabilities across queries. LOCUS is an attention-based approach that generates embeddings by a deterministic forward pass over query encodings and evaluation scores via an encoder model, enabling seamless incorporation of new models to the pool and refinement of existing model embeddings without having to perform any retraining. We additionally train a correctness predictor that uses model embeddings and query encodings to achieve state-of-the-art routing accuracy on unseen queries. Experiments show that LOCUS needs up to 4.8x fewer query evaluation samples than baselines to produce informative and robust embeddings. Moreover, the learned embedding space is geometrically meaningful: proximity reflects model similarity, enabling a range of downstream applications including model comparison and clustering, model portfolio selection, and resilient proxies of unavailable models.

### [212] [Partial Feedback Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21462)
*Shihao Shao,Cong Fang,Zhouchen Lin,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates partial-feedback online learning where instances allow multiple correct labels but only one is observed per round. It provides a near-complete minimax regret characterization for deterministic and randomized learners in set-realizable regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from settings like language generation where multiple valid responses exist, yet only one correct label is available per round. This necessitates understanding regret and learnability within such constraints.

Method: New dimensions (Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension and Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension) are introduced to govern learnability for deterministic and randomized learners. Version spaces are redefined along with auxiliary dimensions to characterize regret bounds.

Result: The paper offers tight minimax regret bounds for deterministic and randomized learners in set-realizable regimes, identifies conditions ensuring inseparability between learnabilities, and resolves open questions in set-valued online learning.

Conclusion: Set realizability governs sublinear regret attainability, but beyond this regime, fundamentally new noise-sensitive complexity measures are needed to characterize learnability effectively.

Abstract: We study partial-feedback online learning, where each instance admits a set of correct labels, but the learner only observes one correct label per round; any prediction within the correct set is counted as correct. This model captures settings such as language generation, where multiple responses may be valid but data provide only a single reference. We give a near-complete characterization of minimax regret for both deterministic and randomized learners in the set-realizable regime, i.e., in the regime where sublinear regret is generally attainable. For deterministic learners, we introduce the Partial-Feedback Littlestone dimension (PFLdim) and show it precisely governs learnability and minimax regret; technically, PFLdim cannot be defined via the standard version space, requiring a new collection version space viewpoint and an auxiliary dimension used only in the proof. We further develop the Partial-Feedback Measure Shattering dimension (PMSdim) to obtain tight bounds for randomized learners. We identify broad conditions ensuring inseparability between deterministic and randomized learnability (e.g., finite Helly number or nested-inclusion label structure), and extend the argument to set-valued online learning, resolving an open question of Raman et al. [2024b]. Finally, we show a sharp separation from weaker realistic and agnostic variants: outside set realizability, the problem can become information-theoretically intractable, with linear regret possible even for $|H|=2$. This highlights the need for fundamentally new, noise-sensitive complexity measures to meaningfully characterize learnability beyond set realizability.

*Marvin Sextro,Weronika Kłos,Gabriel Dernbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MapPFN, a meta-learned perturbation effect estimator utilizing synthetic causal perturbation data to predict biological responses across contexts without further gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing methods which cannot adapt to new interventional evidence beyond their training data and the scarcity of single-cell perturbation datasets.

Method: MapPFN uses prior-data fitted networks pretrained on synthetic data from a causal perturbation prior. By leveraging in-context learning, it predicts post-perturbation outcomes without gradient-based optimization.

Result: MapPFN effectively identifies differentially expressed genes and performs on par with models trained on real single-cell datasets, despite being pretrained only on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable and adaptive approach for estimating biological perturbation effects, potentially enabling broader applicability in unseen biological contexts.

Abstract: Planning effective interventions in biological systems requires treatment-effect models that adapt to unseen biological contexts by identifying their specific underlying mechanisms. Yet single-cell perturbation datasets span only a handful of biological contexts, and existing methods cannot leverage new interventional evidence at inference time to adapt beyond their training data. To meta-learn a perturbation effect estimator, we present MapPFN, a prior-data fitted network (PFN) pretrained on synthetic data generated from a prior over causal perturbations. Given a set of experiments, MapPFN uses in-context learning to predict post-perturbation distributions, without gradient-based optimization. Despite being pretrained on in silico gene knockouts alone, MapPFN identifies differentially expressed genes, matching the performance of models trained on real single-cell data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/marvinsxtr/MapPFN.

### [214] [PPI-SVRG: Unifying Prediction-Powered Inference and Variance Reduction for Semi-Supervised Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21470)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Haoyang Liu,David Simchi-Levi,Will Wei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PPI-SVRG, a semi-supervised stochastic optimization method that leverages pre-trained model predictions and reference gradients for effective variance reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scarce labeled data in semi-supervised learning by utilizing predictions from pre-trained models alongside stochastic variance reduction techniques.

Method: The authors propose PPI-SVRG, which combines Prediction-based Variance Reduction (PPI) and Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG). Mathematical equivalence between PPI and SVRG is established, and a convergence bound is derived that accounts for the impact of prediction uncertainty.

Result: PPI-SVRG achieves significant improvements in performance: reducing Mean Squared Error by 43-52% on mean estimation benchmarks under label scarcity and boosting test accuracy by 2.7-2.9 percentage points on MNIST with 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: The method effectively stabilizes convergence under degraded predictions, maintaining robust results in semi-supervised optimization scenarios.

Abstract: We study semi-supervised stochastic optimization when labeled data is scarce but predictions from pre-trained models are available. PPI and SVRG both reduce variance through control variates -- PPI uses predictions, SVRG uses reference gradients. We show they are mathematically equivalent and develop PPI-SVRG, which combines both. Our convergence bound decomposes into the standard SVRG rate plus an error floor from prediction uncertainty. The rate depends only on loss geometry; predictions affect only the neighborhood size. When predictions are perfect, we recover SVRG exactly. When predictions degrade, convergence remains stable but reaches a larger neighborhood. Experiments confirm the theory: PPI-SVRG reduces MSE by 43--52\% under label scarcity on mean estimation benchmarks and improves test accuracy by 2.7--2.9 percentage points on MNIST with only 10\% labeled data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms under distribution shifts, focusing on diabetes management, and highlights a safety generalization gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of insight into whether training-time safety guarantees in RL algorithms transfer effectively to deployment scenarios, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: Benchmarked safe RL algorithms on a clinical simulator to evaluate performance on unseen patient groups, and applied a test-time shielding approach to filter unsafe actions using learned dynamics models.

Result: Shielding improved safety and performance across algorithms and patient groups, showing a significant 13--14% improvement in Time-in-Range for diabetes management while reducing risks and variability.

Conclusion: Test-time shielding effectively addresses safety challenges under distribution shift in RL deployments, providing a promising direction for improving safety-critical applications like diabetes management.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are typically evaluated under fixed training conditions. We investigate whether training-time safety guarantees transfer to deployment under distribution shift, using diabetes management as a safety-critical testbed. We benchmark safe RL algorithms on a unified clinical simulator and reveal a safety generalization gap: policies satisfying constraints during training frequently violate safety requirements on unseen patients. We demonstrate that test-time shielding, which filters unsafe actions using learned dynamics models, effectively restores safety across algorithms and patient populations. Across eight safe RL algorithms, three diabetes types, and three age groups, shielding achieves Time-in-Range gains of 13--14\% for strong baselines such as PPO-Lag and CPO while reducing clinical risk index and glucose variability. Our simulator and benchmark provide a platform for studying safety under distribution shift in safety-critical control domains.

### [216] [Best Arm Identification with LLM Judges and Limited Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21471)
*Ruicheng Ao,Hongyu Chen,Siyang Gao,Hanwei Li,David Simchi-Levi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for best-arm identification (BAI) combining biased proxy data and selective ground-truth audits, optimizing resource usage with adaptive auditing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and inaccuracies in classical multi-fidelity BAI when working with biased proxies and limited ground-truth resources.

Method: Develop an estimator using proxy scores and inverse-propensity-weighted residuals, coupled with adaptive audit selection to focus on unreliable contexts and competitive arms.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves near-oracle audit efficiency and demonstrates superior empirical performance, confirmed by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The method improves BAI by correcting bias, optimizing ground-truth auditing, and offering strong theoretical and empirical guarantees for performance.

Abstract: We study fixed-confidence best-arm identification (BAI) where a cheap but potentially biased proxy (e.g., LLM judge) is available for every sample, while an expensive ground-truth label can only be acquired selectively when using a human for auditing. Unlike classical multi-fidelity BAI, the proxy is biased (arm- and context-dependent) and ground truth is selectively observed. Consequently, standard multi-fidelity methods can mis-select the best arm, and uniform auditing, though accurate, wastes scarce resources and is inefficient. We prove that without bias correction and propensity adjustment, mis-selection probability may not vanish (even with unlimited proxy data). We then develop an estimator for the mean of each arm that combines proxy scores with inverse-propensity-weighted residuals and form anytime-valid confidence sequences for that estimator. Based on the estimator and confidence sequence, we propose an algorithm that adaptively selects and audits arms. The algorithm concentrates audits on unreliable contexts and close arms and we prove that a plug-in Neyman rule achieves near-oracle audit efficiency. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.

### [217] [TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21135)
*Shicheng Fan,Kun Zhang,Lu Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE, a framework for learning continuous transitions in causal mechanisms, outperforming discrete-switching models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems often exhibit continuous transitions between causal mechanisms, but most existing methods assume discrete, instantaneous changes.

Method: The authors model transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finite atomic mechanisms with time-varying coefficients. They propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that identifies latent causal variables and mechanism trajectories.

Result: TRACE demonstrates the ability to recover mixing trajectories with high accuracy (up to 0.99 correlation) on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: TRACE successfully models and identifies continuous transitions in causal mechanisms, offering advantages over discrete-switching approaches and generalizing to unseen intermediate states.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning methods assume that causal mechanisms switch instantaneously between discrete domains, yet real-world systems often exhibit continuous mechanism transitions. For example, a vehicle's dynamics evolve gradually through a turning maneuver, and human gait shifts smoothly from walking to running. We formalize this setting by modeling transitional mechanisms as convex combinations of finitely many atomic mechanisms, governed by time-varying mixing coefficients. Our theoretical contributions establish that both the latent causal variables and the continuous mixing trajectory are jointly identifiable. We further propose TRACE, a Mixture-of-Experts framework where each expert learns one atomic mechanism during training, enabling recovery of mechanism trajectories at test time. This formulation generalizes to intermediate mechanism states never observed during training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that TRACE recovers mixing trajectories with up to 0.99 correlation, substantially outperforming discrete-switching baselines.

### [218] [Smooth Dynamic Cutoffs for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21147)
*Kevin Han,Haolin Cong,Bowen Deng,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic cutoff technique for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), reducing memory usage and inference time with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLIPs are constrained by high memory and inference time, limiting their scalability for long-term, realistic molecular dynamics simulations.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic cutoff approach that adjusts the interaction radius based on a target number of neighbors for each atom, applied to four state-of-the-art MLIPs.

Result: The dynamic cutoff reduces memory consumption by up to 2.26x and inference time by up to 2.04x with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The dynamic cutoff enables scalable MLIPs for molecular dynamics while maintaining accuracy, with code openly available for broader use.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have proven to be wildly useful for molecular dynamics simulations, powering countless drug and materials discovery applications. However, MLIPs face two primary bottlenecks preventing them from reaching realistic simulation scales: inference time and memory consumption. In this work, we address both issues by challenging the long-held belief that the cutoff radius for the MLIP must be held to a fixed, constant value. For the first time, we introduce a dynamic cutoff formulation that still leads to stable, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation. In introducing the dynamic cutoff, we are able to induce sparsity onto the underlying atom graph by targeting a specific number of neighbors per atom, significantly reducing both memory consumption and inference time. We show the effectiveness of a dynamic cutoff by implementing it onto 4 state of the art MLIPs: MACE, Nequip, Orbv3, and TensorNet, leading to 2.26x less memory consumption and 2.04x faster inference time, depending on the model and atomic system. We also perform an extensive error analysis and find that the dynamic cutoff models exhibit minimal accuracy dropoff compared to their fixed cutoff counterparts on both materials and molecular datasets. All model implementations and training code will be fully open sourced.

### [219] [More Bang for the Buck: Improving the Inference of Large Language Models at a Fixed Budget using Reset and Discard (ReD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21522)
*Sagi Meir,Tommer D. Keidar,Noam Levi,Shlomi Reuveni,Barak Hirshberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel metric, coverage@cost, for evaluating large language models (LLMs) more efficiently within a fixed budget and proposes the Reset-and-Discard (ReD) method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metrics like pass@k for evaluating LLMs show diminishing returns in performance at a fixed budget. A better alternative metric is needed to optimize resource usage.

Method: The Reset-and-Discard (ReD) query method is proposed, which enhances the coverage@cost of LLMs by reducing required attempts and costs while using power-law patterns from pass@k.

Result: Experiments on HumanEval with three LLMs confirm that ReD reduces attempts, tokens, and cost significantly, while also improving budget-based efficiency and inferring inference power-laws.

Conclusion: ReD offers an effective tool for both evaluating and optimizing LLM performance within budget constraints, addressing diminishing returns observed with existing metrics.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) on verifiable tasks is usually measured by pass@k, the probability of answering a question correctly at least once in k trials. At a fixed budget, a more suitable metric is coverage@cost, the average number of unique questions answered as a function of the total number of attempts. We connect the two metrics and show that the empirically-observed power-law behavior in pass@k leads to a sublinear growth of the coverage@cost (diminishing returns). To solve this problem, we propose Reset-and-Discard (ReD), a query method of LLMs that increases coverage@cost for any given budget, regardless of the pass@k form. Moreover, given a pass@k, we can quantitatively predict the savings in the total number of attempts using ReD. If pass@k is not available for the model, ReD can infer its power-law exponent. Experiments on three LLMs using HumanEval demonstrate that ReD substantially reduces the required attempts, tokens, and USD cost to reach a desired coverage, while also offering an efficient way to measure inference power-laws.

### [220] [Graph-Free Root Cause Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21359)
*Luan Pham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PRISM, a framework for Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in the absence of a dependency graph, showing superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RCA methods often incorrectly assume the root cause has the highest anomaly score, failing when faults propagate and amplify downstream.

Method: The paper introduces PRISM, a system for RCA without dependency graphs, and formalizes a class of component-based systems guaranteeing its effectiveness.

Result: PRISM achieves 68% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms baselines with a 258% improvement across 735 failures from 9 real-world datasets, processing swiftly within 8ms per diagnosis.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a theoretically-backed, efficient, and reliable method for RCA when dependency graphs are unavailable, significantly enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Failures in complex systems demand rapid Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to prevent cascading damage. Existing RCA methods that operate without dependency graph typically assume that the root cause having the highest anomaly score. This assumption fails when faults propagate, as a small delay at the root cause can accumulate into a much larger anomaly downstream. In this paper, we propose PRISM, a simple and efficient framework for RCA when the dependency graph is absent. We formulate a class of component-based systems under which PRISM performs RCA with theoretical guarantees. On 735 failures across 9 real-world datasets, PRISM achieves 68% Top-1 accuracy, a 258% improvement over the best baseline, while requiring only 8ms per diagnosis.

*Maria Despoina Siampou,Shushman Choudhury,Shang-Ling Hsu,Neha Arora,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ME-POIs, a framework that combines language model embeddings with human mobility data to capture POI function and improve location representation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geospatial models lack representation of POI functions, focusing on identity or movement patterns rather than real-world usage.

Method: ME-POIs integrates temporally contextualized mobility data with POI embeddings through contrastive learning, and addresses sparsity with spatial pattern propagation.

Result: ME-POIs enhances performance across five map enrichment tasks, outperforming text-only and mobility-only approaches, demonstrating the value of POI function representation.

Conclusion: Augmenting POI embeddings with mobility data improves accuracy and generalizability in geospatial tasks, revealing POI function as crucial to comprehensive POI representations.

Abstract: Recent progress in geospatial foundation models highlights the importance of learning general-purpose representations for real-world locations, particularly points-of-interest (POIs) where human activity concentrates. Existing approaches, however, focus primarily on place identity derived from static textual metadata, or learn representations tied to trajectory context, which capture movement regularities rather than how places are actually used (i.e., POI's function). We argue that POI function is a missing but essential signal for general POI representations. We introduce Mobility-Embedded POIs (ME-POIs), a framework that augments POI embeddings derived, from language models with large-scale human mobility data to learn POI-centric, context-independent representations grounded in real-world usage. ME-POIs encodes individual visits as temporally contextualized embeddings and aligns them with learnable POI representations via contrastive learning to capture usage patterns across users and time. To address long-tail sparsity, we propose a novel mechanism that propagates temporal visit patterns from nearby, frequently visited POIs across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate ME-POIs on five newly proposed map enrichment tasks, testing its ability to capture both the identity and function of POIs. Across all tasks, augmenting text-based embeddings with ME-POIs consistently outperforms both text-only and mobility-only baselines. Notably, ME-POIs trained on mobility data alone can surpass text-only models on certain tasks, highlighting that POI function is a critical component of accurate and generalizable POI representations.

*Jan Schuchardt,Nikita Kalinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops improved methods for privacy amplification in differentially private model training, specifically for matrix factorization under random allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing methods for privacy amplification that rely on Monte Carlo approaches, which may depend on high probability bounds or random abstention, and require a high number of samples proportional to δ.

Method: They propose sampling-free bounds using Rényi divergence and conditional composition, supported by dynamic programming for computational efficiency and providing stronger guarantees for small ε.

Result: The framework effectively computes amplification bounds for various matrix mechanisms without the limitations of earlier methods and shows improved performance in numerical comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances privacy amplification by offering computationally efficient, sampling-free guarantees that outperform previous techniques in matrix factorization under differential privacy.

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for differentially private model training with matrix factorization under random allocation (also known as the balls-in-bins model). Recent work by Choquette-Choo et al. (2025) proposes a sampling-based Monte Carlo approach to compute amplification parameters in this setting. However, their guarantees either only hold with some high probability or require random abstention by the mechanism. Furthermore, the required number of samples for ensuring $(ε,δ)$-DP is inversely proportional to $δ$. In contrast, we develop sampling-free bounds based on Rényi divergence and conditional composition. The former is facilitated by a dynamic programming formulation to efficiently compute the bounds. The latter complements it by offering stronger privacy guarantees for small $ε$, where Rényi divergence bounds inherently lead to an over-approximation. Our framework applies to arbitrary banded and non-banded matrices. Through numerical comparisons, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a broad range of matrix mechanisms used in research and practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether neural networks trained for specific mathematical tasks can learn broader abstract structure, finding mixed results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore AI's potential in aiding mathematical discovery by extracting abstract structures beyond solving fixed mathematical tasks.

Method: The authors train neural networks on predefined mathematical operations and test whether the learned representations capture group-theoretic properties.

Result: Models showed evidence of learning certain abstract properties like commutativity and subgroup structure, but failed on others like the identity element.

Conclusion: AI models demonstrate promise in extracting abstract mathematical structures, though certain foundational concepts remain challenging.

Abstract: While a real-world research program in mathematics may be guided by a motivating question, the process of mathematical discovery is typically open-ended. Ideally, exploration needed to answer the original question will reveal new structures, patterns, and insights that are valuable in their own right. This contrasts with the exam-style paradigm in which the machine learning community typically applies AI to math. To maximize progress in mathematics using AI, we will need to go beyond simple question answering. With this in mind, we explore the extent to which narrow models trained to solve a fixed mathematical task learn broader mathematical structure that can be extracted by a researcher or other AI system. As a basic test case for this, we use the task of training a neural network to predict a group operation (for example, performing modular arithmetic or composition of permutations). We describe a suite of tests designed to assess whether the model captures significant group-theoretic notions such as the identity element, commutativity, or subgroups. Through extensive experimentation we find evidence that models learn representations capable of capturing abstract algebraic properties. For example, we find hints that models capture the commutativity of modular arithmetic. We are also able to train linear classifiers that reliably distinguish between elements of certain subgroups (even though no labels for these subgroups are included in the data). On the other hand, we are unable to extract notions such as the concept of the identity element. Together, our results suggest that in some cases the representations of even small neural networks can be used to distill interesting abstract structure from new mathematical objects.

TL;DR: PARADIS, a physics-inspired weather prediction model, outperforms traditional and machine-learning baselines with efficient training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in existing monolithic machine-learning models for weather forecasting, especially for advection processes.

Method: PARADIS uses a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction components, with innovative neural architecture like a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator for spherical trajectory transport.

Result: PARADIS achieves state-of-the-art forecast accuracy on ERA5-based benchmarks and surpasses baselines such as ECMWF HRES and DeepMind's GraphCast with reduced training cost.

Conclusion: A physics-driven approach, like PARADIS, can make weather forecasting more accurate and computationally efficient by leveraging inductive biases and specialized mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent machine-learning approaches to weather forecasting often employ a monolithic architecture, where distinct physical mechanisms (advection, transport), diffusion-like mixing, thermodynamic processes, and forcing are represented implicitly within a single large network. This representation is particularly problematic for advection, where long-range transport must be treated with expensive global interaction mechanisms or through deep, stacked convolutional layers. To mitigate this, we present PARADIS, a physics-inspired global weather prediction model that imposes inductive biases on network behavior through a functional decomposition into advection, diffusion, and reaction blocks acting on latent variables. We implement advection through a Neural Semi-Lagrangian operator that performs trajectory-based transport via differentiable interpolation on the sphere, enabling end-to-end learning of both the latent modes to be transported and their characteristic trajectories. Diffusion-like processes are modeled through depthwise-separable spatial mixing, while local source terms and vertical interactions are modeled via pointwise channel interactions, enabling operator-level physical structure. PARADIS provides state-of-the-art forecast skill at a fraction of the training cost. On ERA5-based benchmarks, the 1 degree PARADIS model, with a total training cost of less than a GPU month, meets or exceeds the performance of 0.25 degree traditional and machine-learning baselines, including the ECMWF HRES forecast and DeepMind's GraphCast.

TL;DR: The paper presents FedGEM, a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for clustering data across multiple clients without prior knowledge of the total clusters, demonstrating superior performance and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ is unknown across heterogeneous clients with potentially overlapping local cluster sets.

Method: FedGEM trains mixture models using federated learning with local EM steps, uncertainty sets, and central server computations to infer global cluster overlaps and the total number of clusters.

Result: Probabilistic convergence guarantees are provided under standard assumptions. Experimental results show equal or better performance than centralized EM and other federated clustering methods.

Conclusion: FedGEM is a theoretically sound and empirically robust method for federated clustering with unknown clusters, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: We study the problem of federated clustering when the total number of clusters $K$ across clients is unknown, and the clients have heterogeneous but potentially overlapping cluster sets in their local data. To that end, we develop FedGEM: a federated generalized expectation-maximization algorithm for the training of mixture models with an unknown number of components. Our proposed algorithm relies on each of the clients performing EM steps locally, and constructing an uncertainty set around the maximizer associated with each local component. The central server utilizes the uncertainty sets to learn potential cluster overlaps between clients, and infer the global number of clusters via closed-form computations. We perform a thorough theoretical study of our algorithm, presenting probabilistic convergence guarantees under common assumptions. Subsequently, we study the specific setting of isotropic GMMs, providing tractable, low-complexity computations to be performed by each client during each iteration of the algorithm, as well as rigorously verifying assumptions required for algorithm convergence. We perform various numerical experiments, where we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to centralized EM, and that it outperforms various existing federated clustering methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a randomized mechanism based on Wishart projections for differential privacy, analyzing its effectiveness for vector- and matrix-valued queries, and examines privacy implications in LoRA-style updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of Wishart projections in achieving differential privacy, especially for vector-valued and matrix-valued queries, and investigate privacy implications for LoRA-style fine-tuning techniques.

Method: The authors study the differential privacy properties of the Wishart projection mechanism, analyze its performance on vector- and matrix-valued queries, and evaluate privacy guarantees with and without additional noise.

Result: The mechanism provides Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees for vector-valued queries without adding noise but fails for matrix-valued queries without noise. However, adding noise and leveraging low-rank projections improve privacy guarantees for the latter.

Conclusion: Wishart projections can provide differential privacy for certain cases. However, matrix-valued queries require additional measures for privacy. Low-rank fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) can result in better privacy than full fine-tuning at similar noise levels.

Abstract: We introduce the (Wishart) projection mechanism, a randomized map of the form $S \mapsto M f(S)$ with $M \sim W_d(1/r I_d, r)$ and study its differential privacy properties. For vector-valued queries $f$, we prove non-asymptotic DP guarantees without any additive noise, showing that Wishart randomness alone can suffice. For matrix-valued queries, however, we establish a sharp negative result: in the noise-free setting, the mechanism is not DP, and we demonstrate its vulnerability by implementing a near perfect membership inference attack (AUC $> 0.99$). We then analyze a noisy variant and prove privacy amplification due to randomness and low rank projection, in both large- and small-rank regimes, yielding stronger privacy guarantees than additive noise alone. Finally, we show that LoRA-style updates are an instance of the matrix-valued mechanism, implying that LoRA is not inherently private despite its built-in randomness, but that low-rank fine-tuning can be more private than full fine-tuning at the same noise level. Preliminary experiments suggest that tighter accounting enables lower noise and improved accuracy in practice.

### [227] [SWE-Spot: Building Small Repo-Experts with Repository-Centric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21649)
*Jinjun Peng,Magnus Saebo,Tianjun Zhong,Yi-Jie Cheng,Junfeng Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Simin Chen,Yangruibo Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Repository-Centric Learning' (RCL) as a new approach to train Small Language Models (SLMs) for better performance in unfamiliar codebases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task-centric learning approaches for small language models struggle in resource-constrained environments and fail at strong generalization in working with complex, unfamiliar codebases.

Method: The proposed RCL focuses on repository depth over task breadth, enabling models to internalize target software environments via parametric knowledge acquisition rather than inference-time search. A four-unit Repository-Centric Experience was designed to transform codebases for training specialized models like SWE-Spot-4B.

Result: The SWE-Spot-4B models, developed under the RCL paradigm, outperform larger open-weight models (e.g., CWM, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and are competitive with efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Repository mastery is essential for improving efficiency and training sample utilization in Small Language Models, making RCL a valuable approach complementary to general coding capabilities.

Abstract: The deployment of coding agents in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments drives the demand for capable open-weight Small Language Models (SLMs). However, they suffer from a fundamental capability gap: unlike frontier large models, they lack the inference-time strong generalization to work with complicated, unfamiliar codebases. We identify that the prevailing Task-Centric Learning (TCL) paradigm, which scales exposure across disparate repositories, fails to address this limitation. In response, we propose Repository-Centric Learning (RCL), a paradigm shift that prioritizes vertical repository depth over horizontal task breadth, suggesting SLMs must internalize the "physics" of a target software environment through parametric knowledge acquisition, rather than attempting to recover it via costly inference-time search. Following this new paradigm, we design a four-unit Repository-Centric Experience, transforming static codebases into interactive learning signals, to train SWE-Spot-4B, a family of highly compact models built as repo-specialized experts that breaks established scaling trends, outperforming open-weight models up to larger (e.g., CWM by Meta, Qwen3-Coder-30B) and surpassing/matching efficiency-focused commercial models (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-5-nano) across multiple SWE tasks. Further analysis reveals that RCL yields higher training sample efficiency and lower inference costs, emphasizing that for building efficient intelligence, repository mastery is a distinct and necessary dimension that complements general coding capability.

### [228] [Efficient Simple Regret Algorithms for Stochastic Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21167)
*Shuai Liu,Alireza Bakhtiari,Alex Ayoub,Botao Hao,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective, proposing algorithms with state-of-the-art performance and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill a gap in the literature by providing simple regret guarantees for stochastic contextual logistic bandits, which were previously known only for the linear setting.

Method: The authors develop a deterministic algorithm with regret bound $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$ and extend a variant of Thompson Sampling to logistic bandits, ensuring a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Both approaches avoid dependence on the constant $κ$.

Result: The algorithms achieve state-of-the-art regret bounds and are computationally efficient, with randomized methods being cheaper to run than deterministic ones. Experimental results support the theoretical contributions.

Conclusion: The paper advances the field by establishing regret guarantees for logistic and linear bandits, offering algorithms that are not only theoretically sound but also practically efficient.

Abstract: We study stochastic contextual logistic bandits under the simple regret objective. While simple regret guarantees have been established for the linear case, no such results were previously known for the logistic setting. Building on ideas from contextual linear bandits and self-concordant analysis, we propose the first algorithm that achieves simple regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d/\sqrt{T})$. Notably, the leading term of our regret bound is free of the constant $κ= \mathcal O(\exp(S))$, where $S$ is a bound on the magnitude of the unknown parameter vector. The algorithm is shown to be fully tractable when the action set is finite. We also introduce a new variant of Thompson Sampling tailored to the simple-regret setting. This yields the first simple regret guarantee for randomized algorithms in stochastic contextual linear bandits, with regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$. Extending this method to the logistic case, we obtain a similarly structured Thompson Sampling algorithm that achieves the same regret bound -- $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}/\sqrt{T})$ -- again with no dependence on $κ$ in the leading term. The randomized algorithms, as expected, are cheaper to run than their deterministic counterparts. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to empirically validate these theoretical guarantees.

### [229] [Why Adam Works Better with $β_1 = β_2$: The Missing Gradient Scale Invariance Principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21739)
*Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Jose I. Mestre,Manuel F. Dolz,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the empirical observation that Adam optimizer performs better when momentum parameters are equal. It introduces the concept of gradient scale invariance to explain this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and explain why Adam performs better in practical training settings when $β_1 = β_2$, despite the absence of a theoretical explanation.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of gradient scale invariance and demonstrate that Adam becomes first-order gradient scale invariant if and only if $β_1 = β_2$. They validate this theory through experiments across different tasks and architectures.

Result: The study finds that balanced momentum parameters ($β_1 = β_2$) enable smoother gradient updates. This alignment supports and explains a previously unexplained optimization behavior while being consistent with recent optimizer designs.

Conclusion: The paper resolves an open question about Adam's behavior by introducing gradient scale invariance. This insight provides a theoretical foundation to improve current optimization strategies and guide the development of future optimizers.

Abstract: Adam has been at the core of large-scale training for almost a decade, yet a simple empirical fact remains unaccounted for: both validation scores and the qualitative behaviour of the training runs improve when the momentum parameters satisfy $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Some recent studies have reported this pattern, but there is still no explanation for why this choice helps. We show that this choice is closely tied to a structural property that we refer to as \textit{gradient scale invariance}. We formalize this notion and prove that Adam becomes gradient scale invariant of first order if and only if $β_{1}=β_{2}$. This perspective places the balanced regime of Adam in direct alignment with the design principles underlying several recent optimizers that explicitly enforce scale-robust updates. The theory is supported by experiments across vision and language tasks, and across different architectural families, in which rescaling the gradient has a markedly smoother effect on the update when $β_{1}=β_{2}$. Overall, our results offer a coherent explanation for an open question in the behavior of Adam and provide a simple principle that helps guide the design of future optimizers.

*Fernando Palafox,Jingqi Li,Jesse Milzman,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An agent's information-gathering framework is proposed, decoupling modeling choices and focusing on accelerated learning using Massey’s directed information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents learning in unknown dynamical systems benefit from active information gathering, but existing approaches are limited by their dependency on specific modeling choices. The paper aims to unify and generalize these approaches.

Method: Introduced a unifying framework that isolates modeling choices from the information-gathering cost. Derived a cost based on Massey's directed information and proved its connection to mutual information-based methods.

Result: Mutual information is shown as a specific case of the derived cost. Established a theoretical connection with linearized Bayesian estimation and demonstrated its practical value through experiments with various systems.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes and justifies mutual information-based methods for active learning, broadening their application to diverse systems.

Abstract: An agent operating in an unknown dynamical system must learn its dynamics from observations. Active information gathering accelerates this learning, but existing methods derive bespoke costs for specific modeling choices: dynamics models, belief update procedures, observation models, and planners. We present a unifying framework that decouples these choices from the information-gathering cost by explicitly exposing the causal dependencies between parameters, beliefs, and controls. Using this framework, we derive a general information-gathering cost based on Massey's directed information that assumes only Markov dynamics with additive noise and is otherwise agnostic to modeling choices. We prove that the mutual information cost used in existing literature is a special case of our cost. Then, we leverage our framework to establish an explicit connection between the mutual information cost and information gain in linearized Bayesian estimation, thereby providing theoretical justification for mutual information-based active learning approaches. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of our framework through experiments spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-agent systems.

*Kamal Berahmand,Saman Forouzandeh,Mehrnoush Mohammadi,Parham Moradi,Mahdi Jalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AC2L-GAD, a graph anomaly detection framework designed to overcome challenges in unsupervised settings by leveraging counterfactual reasoning and selective augmentation, achieving high efficacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph anomaly detection is hindered by label scarcity and class imbalance. Existing contrastive learning solutions face issues with semantic inconsistency in positive pairs and uninformative negative samples.

Method: The paper proposes AC2L-GAD, which combines active information-theoretic selection with counterfactual generation to create anomaly-preserving positive samples and challenging negative contrasts while reducing computational costs through strategic sampling.

Result: Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world graphs, demonstrate that AC2L-GAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in cases with complex attribute-structure anomalies.

Conclusion: AC2L-GAD effectively balances computational efficiency with high anomaly detection performance, making it suitable for scenarios requiring structured and attribute-sensitive analysis.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal patterns in networks, but faces significant challenges from label scarcity and extreme class imbalance. While graph contrastive learning offers a promising unsupervised solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: random augmentations break semantic consistency in positive pairs, while naive negative sampling produces trivial, uninformative contrasts. We propose AC2L-GAD, an Active Counterfactual Contrastive Learning framework that addresses both limitations through principled counterfactual reasoning. By combining information-theoretic active selection with counterfactual generation, our approach identifies structurally complex nodes and generates anomaly-preserving positive augmentations alongside normal negative counterparts that provide hard contrasts, while restricting expensive counterfactual generation to a strategically selected subset. This design reduces computational overhead by approximately 65% compared to full-graph counterfactual generation while maintaining detection quality. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including real-world financial transaction graphs from GADBench, show that AC2L-GAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with notable gains in datasets where anomalies exhibit complex attribute-structure interactions.

*Adia Lumadjeng,Ilker Birbil,Erman Acar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECSEL is an interpretable classification method using signomial equations for symbolic regression tasks, outperforming other techniques in both accuracy and computation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a classification method that provides interpretable results by leveraging compact signomial structures, which are evident in many symbolic regression benchmarks.

Method: ECSEL integrates explainability with classification by directly construing signomial equations as classifiers and explanations, while showing desirable features like analyzing global feature behavior and decision boundaries.

Result: ECSEL recovers more target equations than state-of-the-art alternatives, achieves competitive classification accuracy, exposes dataset biases, and supports counterfactual reasoning in practical scenarios, such as e-commerce or fraud detection.

Conclusion: By balancing accuracy with interpretability, ECSEL establishes itself as a computationally efficient and effective tool for actionable insights and dataset bias analysis.

Abstract: We introduce ECSEL, an explainable classification method that learns formal expressions in the form of signomial equations, motivated by the observation that many symbolic regression benchmarks admit compact signomial structure. ECSEL directly constructs a structural, closed-form expression that serves as both a classifier and an explanation. On standard symbolic regression benchmarks, our method recovers a larger fraction of target equations than competing state-of-the-art approaches while requiring substantially less computation. Leveraging this efficiency, ECSEL achieves classification accuracy competitive with established machine learning models without sacrificing interpretability. Further, we show that ECSEL satisfies some desirable properties regarding global feature behavior, decision-boundary analysis, and local feature attributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies i.e., e-commerce and fraud detection, demonstrate that the learned equations expose dataset biases, support counterfactual reasoning, and yield actionable insights.

*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Kexuan Xin,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study addresses entity alignment (EA) in knowledge graphs (KGs) using a novel parallel encoding strategy, overcoming limitations of existing EA models and utilizing foundation models effectively for unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EA models cannot align unseen KGs without retraining, and adapting graph foundation models (GFMs) directly for EA is ineffective due to the reasoning horizon gap.

Method: The proposed method involves parallel streams encoding using seed EA pairs as anchors, a merged relation graph for global dependencies, and a learnable interaction module for precise alignment.

Result: Experiments show the model's effectiveness and its strong generalizability to unseen knowledge graphs, demonstrating its potential for broader applications.

Conclusion: The study provides a promising framework for efficient and generalized entity alignment in KGs, addressing a key challenge of long-range dependency capture in existing approaches.

Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is critical for knowledge graph (KG) fusion. Existing EA models lack transferability and are incapable of aligning unseen KGs without retraining. While using graph foundation models (GFMs) offer a solution, we find that directly adapting GFMs to EA remains largely ineffective. This stems from a critical "reasoning horizon gap": unlike link prediction in GFMs, EA necessitates capturing long-range dependencies across sparse and heterogeneous KG structuresTo address this challenge, we propose a EA foundation model driven by a parallel encoding strategy. We utilize seed EA pairs as local anchors to guide the information flow, initializing and encoding two parallel streams simultaneously. This facilitates anchor-conditioned message passing and significantly shortens the inference trajectory by leveraging local structural proximity instead of global search. Additionally, we incorporate a merged relation graph to model global dependencies and a learnable interaction module for precise matching. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its strong generalizability to unseen KGs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flow Perturbation++, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation, improving unbiased Jacobian estimation and equilibrium sampling in high-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited scalability of CNFs for high-dimensional unbiased Boltzmann sampling caused by computational cost and limitations of existing stochastic Jacobian estimators.

Method: Flow Perturbation++ introduces stepwise, unbiased Jacobian estimation during the discretization of the probability-flow ODE, resulting in lower variance compared to Flow Perturbation.

Result: Flow Perturbation++ showed significantly improved equilibrium sampling performance for a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein within a Sequential Monte Carlo framework.

Conclusion: Flow Perturbation++ effectively reduces variance without sacrificing unbiasedness, advancing scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling in high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: The scalability of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for unbiased Boltzmann sampling remains limited in high-dimensional systems due to the cost of Jacobian-determinant evaluation, which requires $D$ backpropagation passes through the flow layers. Existing stochastic Jacobian estimators such as the Hutchinson trace estimator reduce computation but introduce bias, while the recently proposed Flow Perturbation method is unbiased yet suffers from high variance. We present \textbf{Flow Perturbation++}, a variance-reduced extension of Flow Perturbation that discretizes the probability-flow ODE and performs unbiased stepwise Jacobian estimation at each integration step. This multi-step construction retains the unbiasedness of Flow Perturbation while achieves substantially lower estimator variance. Integrated into a Sequential Monte Carlo framework, Flow Perturbation++ achieves significantly improved equilibrium sampling on a 1000D Gaussian Mixture Model and the all-atom Chignolin protein compared with Hutchinson-based and single-step Flow Perturbation baselines.

### [235] [Rethinking Refinement: Correcting Generative Bias without Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21182)
*Xin Peng,Ang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR) for generative models to correct biases in generated samples without altering the sampling dynamics, providing improved fidelity and diversity in high-dimensional outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the systematic biases in generative models' outputs, particularly in high-dimensional data, and improve sample quality efficiently without complicating the sampling process.

Method: The BFR framework uses two refinement strategies: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement through lightweight augmentations. It applies deterministic corrections and preserves the original sampling trajectory.

Result: Experiments on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ show improved sample fidelity and coverage. For example, latent space refinement achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.46 on MNIST, starting from a base FID of 3.95, using only a single additional function evaluation.

Conclusion: BFR provides an efficient and effective post-hoc bias correction method that improves generative model outputs without altering the sampling trajectory, achieving state-of-the-art results in fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Generative models, including diffusion and flow-based models, often exhibit systematic biases that degrade sample quality, particularly in high-dimensional settings. We revisit refinement methods and show that effective bias correction can be achieved as a post-hoc procedure, without noise injection or multi-step resampling of the sampling process. We propose a flow-matching-based \textbf{Bi-stage Flow Refinement (BFR)} framework with two refinement strategies operating at different stages: latent space alignment for approximately invertible generators and data space refinement trained with lightweight augmentations. Unlike previous refiners that perturb sampling dynamics, BFR preserves the original ODE trajectory and applies deterministic corrections to generated samples. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ at 256x256 resolution demonstrate consistent improvements in fidelity and coverage; notably, starting from base samples with FID 3.95, latent space refinement achieves a \textbf{state-of-the-art} FID of \textbf{1.46} on MNIST using only a single additional function evaluation (1-NFE), while maintaining sample diversity.

*Jinhang Chai,Xuyuan Liu,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies transfer learning for structured matrix estimation, addressing scenarios with growing ambient dimensions and intrinsic representations by proposing a novel estimation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and address challenges in transfer learning for structured matrix estimation when expanding dimensions and representations.

Method: Introduced a transfer framework where the target decomposes into embedded source components, low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and developed an anchored alternating projection estimator with deterministic error bounds.

Result: Established improved estimation rates when rank and sparsity increments are small, with theoretical guarantees for Markov transition and covariance matrix estimations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively transfers learned information under dimension and representation growth, showing consistent gains both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: Learning systems often expand their ambient features or latent representations over time, embedding earlier representations into larger spaces with limited new latent structure. We study transfer learning for structured matrix estimation under simultaneous growth of the ambient dimension and the intrinsic representation, where a well-estimated source task is embedded as a subspace of a higher-dimensional target task.
  We propose a general transfer framework in which the target parameter decomposes into an embedded source component, low-dimensional low-rank innovations, and sparse edits, and develop an anchored alternating projection estimator that preserves transferred subspaces while estimating only low-dimensional innovations and sparse modifications. We establish deterministic error bounds that separate target noise, representation growth, and source estimation error, yielding strictly improved rates when rank and sparsity increments are small.
  We demonstrate the generality of the framework by applying it to two canonical problems. For Markov transition matrix estimation from a single trajectory, we derive end-to-end theoretical guarantees under dependent noise. For structured covariance estimation under enlarged dimensions, we provide complementary theoretical analysis in the appendix and empirically validate consistent transfer gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method for SSVEP-based BCIs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variability of SSVEP signals across subjects and the high cost of user-specific annotations reduce decoding accuracy in brain-computer interfaces.

Method: The method includes a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy, a two-stage framework called Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) with Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL) and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), and a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Benchmark and BETA datasets under varying signal lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance cross-subject SSVEP signal decoding, providing a robust solution for brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely used due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and user-friendliness. Accurate decoding of SSVEP signals is crucial for interpreting user intentions in BCI applications. However, signal variability across subjects and the costly user-specific annotation limit recognition performance. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-subject domain adaptation method built upon the self-training paradigm. Specifically, a Filter-Bank Euclidean Alignment (FBEA) strategy is designed to exploit frequency information from SSVEP filter banks. Then, we propose a Cross-Subject Self-Training (CSST) framework consisting of two stages: Pre-Training with Adversarial Learning (PTAL), which aligns the source and target distributions, and Dual-Ensemble Self-Training (DEST), which refines pseudo-label quality. Moreover, we introduce a Time-Frequency Augmented Contrastive Learning (TFA-CL) module to enhance feature discriminability across multiple augmented views. Extensive experiments on the Benchmark and BETA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying signal lengths, highlighting its superiority.

### [238] [StepShield: When, Not Whether to Intervene on Rogue Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22136)
*Gloria Felicia,Michael Eniolade,Jinfeng He,Zitha Sasindran,Hemant Kumar,Milan Hussain Angati,Sandeep Bandarupalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StepShield is a novel benchmark that measures not just the detection of safety violations in AI agents, but the timing of such detections, emphasizing early intervention over post-mortem analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety benchmarks fail to account for when violations are detected, which is crucial for enabling early intervention and reducing economic costs. This gap motivated the development of StepShield.

Method: The authors introduced StepShield, encompassing 9,213 AI agent code trajectories, annotated data, and three temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. They compared the effectiveness of a static analyzer and an LLM-based judge in identifying early safety violations.

Result: Analysis revealed that the LLM-based system achieved a 59% Early Intervention Rate (EIR), significantly outperforming the static analyzer at 26%. Additionally, applying these insights with the HybridGuard detector reduced monitoring costs by 75%, projecting $108M in savings at enterprise scale over five years.

Conclusion: StepShield provides a pioneering framework for evaluating not just whether violations occur but when they are detected, promoting the development of both safer and more cost-efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Existing agent safety benchmarks report binary accuracy, conflating early intervention with post-mortem analysis. A detector that flags a violation at step 8 enables intervention; one that reports it at step 48 provides only forensic value. This distinction is critical, yet current benchmarks cannot measure it. We introduce StepShield, the first benchmark to evaluate when violations are detected, not just whether. StepShield contains 9,213 code agent trajectories, including 1,278 meticulously annotated training pairs and a 7,935-trajectory test set with a realistic 8.1% rogue rate. Rogue behaviors are grounded in real-world security incidents across six categories. We propose three novel temporal metrics: Early Intervention Rate (EIR), Intervention Gap, and Tokens Saved. Surprisingly, our evaluation reveals that an LLM-based judge achieves 59% EIR while a static analyzer achieves only 26%, a 2.3x performance gap that is entirely invisible to standard accuracy metrics. We further show that early detection has direct economic benefits: our cascaded HybridGuard detector reduces monitoring costs by 75% and projects to $108M in cumulative savings over five years at enterprise scale. By shifting the focus of evaluation from whether to when, StepShield provides a new foundation for building safer and more economically viable AI agents. The code and data are released under an Apache 2.0 license.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for analyzing feature behaviors in geometric and topological deep learning models, with a multiscale extension for hierarchical feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distribution and diffusion behavior of features in GDL and TDL models during training is underexplored.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on cellular sheaf theory to track feature consistency and harmonicity in graph-based architectures, along with a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis.

Result: This framework connects the geometric and topological structures with learned signals in GDL and TDL models, offering enhanced insights for tasks like node classification and community detection.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel topological approach to study feature diffusion and aggregation in GDL and TDL, encouraging further research in this area.

Abstract: Combinatorial and topological structures, such as graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes, form the foundation of geometric and topological deep learning (GDL and TDL) architectures. These models aggregate signals over such domains, integrate local features, and generate representations for diverse real-world applications. However, the distribution and diffusion behavior of GDL and TDL features during training remains an open and underexplored problem. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a cellular sheaf theoretic framework for modeling and analyzing the local consistency and harmonicity of node features and edge weights in graph-based architectures. By tracking local feature alignments and agreements through sheaf structures, the framework offers a topological perspective on feature diffusion and aggregation. Furthermore, a multiscale extension inspired by topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to capture hierarchical feature interactions in graph models. This approach enables a joint characterization of GDL and TDL architectures based on their underlying geometric and topological structures and the learned signals defined on them, providing insights for future studies on conventional tasks such as node classification, substructure detection, and community detection.

*Mehmet Ergezer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the interaction between model architectures and temporal context in EEG decoding, testing five architectures on a naturalistic movie-watching dataset with varying segment lengths. Results reveal architectural trade-offs in efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate how different neural network architectures, with varying temporal context, influence the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of EEG decoding, especially given the increasing interest in utilizing models for real-world EEG data.

Method: The paper evaluates five architectures—CNN, LSTM, EEGXF (stabilized Transformer), S4, and S5—on a 4-class task using a movie-watching EEG dataset. The models are tested across segment lengths from 8s to 128s, and their performance is assessed under different conditions, including cross-frequency shifts, out-of-distribution inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization.

Result: S5 achieves peak accuracy with fewer parameters (98.7% accuracy at 64s with ~20x fewer parameters than CNN). However, S5 struggles with over-confidence in OOD tasks. EEGXF, though less accurate in-distribution, is more robust and conservative in uncertain scenarios, remaining stable under frequency shifts.

Conclusion: The study highlights a trade-off between efficiency and robustness: S5 is preferable for high accuracy with fewer parameters, whereas EEGXF is suitable for scenarios emphasizing robustness and conservative uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding. Using the HBN movie-watching dataset, we benchmark five architectures, CNN, LSTM, a stabilized Transformer (EEGXF), S4, and S5, on a 4-class task across segment lengths from 8s to 128s. Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution. These results reveal a practical efficiency-robustness trade-off: S5 for parameter-efficient peak accuracy; EEGXF when robustness and conservative uncertainty are critical.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'soft quantization,' introducing attractive couplings during training to discrete neural network weights for mixed-precision quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel approach for model quantization that achieves effective discretization and provides insights on compression versus generalization.

Method: Introduces short-range attractive couplings between weights during training, using only two additional hyperparameters.

Result: 'Soft quantization' outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization in experiments with ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The approach offers a new path for model compression while enabling exploration of compression and generalization trade-offs.

Abstract: We show that introducing short-range attractive couplings between the weights of a neural network during training provides a novel avenue for model quantization. These couplings rapidly induce the discretization of a model's weight distribution, and they do so in a mixed-precision manner despite only relying on two additional hyperparameters. We demonstrate that, within an appropriate range of hyperparameters, our "soft quantization'' scheme outperforms histogram-equalized post-training quantization on ResNet-20/CIFAR-10. Soft quantization provides both a new pipeline for the flexible compression of machine learning models and a new tool for investigating the trade-off between compression and generalization in high-dimensional loss landscapes.

### [242] [Optimistic Transfer under Task Shift via Bellman Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21924)
*Jinhang Chai,Enpei Zhang,Elynn Chen,Yujun Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses transfer in online reinforcement learning by introducing a framework that corrects task mismatch to enable effective reuse of source data, demonstrating its efficacy both theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve learning efficiency in online reinforcement learning by effectively transferring knowledge from related tasks, despite differences in task dynamics or rewards.

Method: The authors propose a method called re-weighted targeting (RWT), which corrects for task mismatch at the operator level by adjusting continuation values and applying a change of measure to handle transition differences.

Result: They developed the RWT framework, provided regret bounds that depend on task shift complexity, and showed improved performance through experiments in both tabular and neural network contexts.

Conclusion: The study concludes that one-step Bellman alignment is a foundational principle for transfer in online RL, providing a statistically sound approach to reusing source data and enhancing learning performance.

Abstract: We study online transfer reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic Markov decision processes, where experience from related source tasks is available during learning on a target task. A fundamental difficulty is that task similarity is typically defined in terms of rewards or transitions, whereas online RL algorithms operate on Bellman regression targets. As a result, naively reusing source Bellman updates introduces systematic bias and invalidates regret guarantees.
  We identify one-step Bellman alignment as the correct abstraction for transfer in online RL and propose re-weighted targeting (RWT), an operator-level correction that retargets continuation values and compensates for transition mismatch via a change of measure. RWT reduces task mismatch to a fixed one-step correction and enables statistically sound reuse of source data.
  This alignment yields a two-stage RWT $Q$-learning framework that separates variance reduction from bias correction. Under RKHS function approximation, we establish regret bounds that scale with the complexity of the task shift rather than the target MDP. Empirical results in both tabular and neural network settings demonstrate consistent improvements over single-task learning and naïve pooling, highlighting Bellman alignment as a model-agnostic transfer principle for online RL.

*Kaiyuan Tan,Kendra Givens,Peilun Li,Thomas Beckers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PHDME, a framework combining machine learning and phyiscs-based methods for trajectory forecasting in sparse data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address forecasting challenges in dynamical systems where data is sparse and knowledge of governing equations is incomplete.

Method: The approach involves using Gaussian process-distributed Port-Hamiltonian systems (GP-dPHS) to build energy-based models, creating artificial datasets for training diffusion models, and providing calibrated uncertainty estimates using split conformal methods.

Result: PHDME achieves higher accuracy and improved physical consistency in data-scarce scenarios, as demonstrated on PDE benchmarks and real-world systems.

Conclusion: PHDME demonstrates that combining physics-informed priors and machine learning can enhance reliability and accuracy in trajectory forecasting with limited data.

Abstract: Diffusion models provide expressive priors for forecasting trajectories of dynamical systems, but are typically unreliable in the sparse data regime. Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) improves reliability in such settings; however, most methods require \emph{explicit governing equations} during training, which are often only partially known due to complex and nonlinear dynamics. We introduce \textbf{PHDME}, a port-Hamiltonian diffusion framework designed for \emph{sparse observations} and \emph{incomplete physics}. PHDME leverages port-Hamiltonian structural prior but does not require full knowledge of the closed-form governing equations. Our approach first trains a Gaussian process distributed Port-Hamiltonian system (GP-dPHS) on limited observations to capture an energy-based representation of the dynamics. The GP-dPHS is then used to generate a physically consistent artificial dataset for diffusion training, and to inform the diffusion model with a structured physics residual loss. After training, the diffusion model acts as an amortized sampler and forecaster for fast trajectory generation. Finally, we apply split conformal calibration to provide uncertainty statements for the generated predictions. Experiments on PDE benchmarks and a real-world spring system show improved accuracy and physical consistency under data scarcity.

### [244] [Understanding Diffusion Models via Ratio-Based Function Approximation with SignReLU Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21242)
*Luwei Sun,Dongrui Shen,Jianfe Li,Yulong Zhao,Han Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for approximating ratio-type functionals with kernel-based densities, focusing on diffusion generative models and using SignReLU-enabled deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in estimating conditional densities, particularly ratio-type functionals, which play a key role in diffusion-based generative modeling.

Method: They propose using deep neural networks with SignReLU activation to approximate ratio-type functionals. They provide theoretical proofs of approximation bounds and apply it to denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs).

Result: The study establishes L^p approximation bounds, decomposes excess KL risk into approximation and estimation errors, and offers generalization guarantees for finite-sample training.

Conclusion: This provides a robust theoretical basis for utilizing SignReLU networks to improve generative modeling with guarantees on performance under finite samples.

Abstract: Motivated by challenges in conditional generative modeling, where the target conditional density takes the form of a ratio f1 over f2, this paper develops a theoretical framework for approximating such ratio-type functionals. Here, f1 and f2 are kernel-based marginal densities that capture structured interactions, a setting central to diffusion-based generative models. We provide a concise proof for approximating these ratio-type functionals using deep neural networks with the SignReLU activation function, leveraging the activation's piecewise structure. Under standard regularity assumptions, we establish L^p(Omega) approximation bounds and convergence rates. Specializing to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), we construct a SignReLU-based neural estimator for the reverse process and derive bounds on the excess Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk between the generated and true data distributions. Our analysis decomposes this excess risk into approximation and estimation error components. These results provide generalization guarantees for finite-sample training of diffusion-based generative models.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper presents STAER, a framework for Class-Incremental Learning with Spiking Neural Networks, achieving state-of-the-art results by addressing catastrophic forgetting and temporal misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are ideal for continuous learning but struggle with Class-Incremental Learning due to catastrophic forgetting and spike timing misalignment.

Method: STAER incorporates Soft-DTW alignment loss, temporal mechanisms on output logits, and a ResNet19 spiking backbone to ensure robust learning and temporal fidelity.

Result: STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10, outperforming strong ANN baselines like ER and DER++.

Conclusion: STAER positions itself as a scalable solution for lifelong learning in SNNs, providing representational stability and surpassing traditional ANN baselines.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are inherently suited for continuous learning due to their event-driven temporal dynamics; however, their application to Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) has been hindered by catastrophic forgetting and the temporal misalignment of spike patterns. In this work, we introduce Spiking Temporal Alignment with Experience Replay (STAER), a novel framework that explicitly preserves temporal structure to bridge the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs. Our approach integrates a differentiable Soft-DTW alignment loss to maintain spike timing fidelity and employs a temporal expansion and contraction mechanism on output logits to enforce robust representation learning. Implemented on a deep ResNet19 spiking backbone, STAER achieves state-of-the-art performance on Sequential-MNIST and Sequential-CIFAR10. Empirical results demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms strong ANN baselines (ER, DER++) while preserving biologically plausible dynamics. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit temporal alignment is critical for representational stability, positioning STAER as a scalable solution for spike-native lifelong learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BioNIC, a biologically inspired neural network model based on mouse cortical column architecture for emotion classification, achieving comparable performance to conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how constraints and features inspired by biological neural networks can enhance artificial intelligence systems, while leveraging advanced connectomics data.

Method: The study created a neural network with structural and functional constraints inspired by the mouse Primary Visual Cortex, using features like laminar organization, Hebbian synaptic plasticity, homeostatic regulation, and convolutional layers for retinotopic mapping.

Result: BioNIC achieved a classification accuracy of 59.77% on the FER-2013 dataset, demonstrating that biologically constrained architectures can rival conventional models.

Conclusion: Incorporating biologically-inspired architectural and functional elements is a viable approach for AI development, and peta-scale connectomics data offers new possibilities for advancements in both neuroscience and AI.

Abstract: We present BioNIC, a multi-layer feedforward neural network for emotion classification, inspired by detailed synaptic connectivity graphs from the MICrONs dataset. At a structural level, we incorporate architectural constraints derived from a single cortical column of the mouse Primary Visual Cortex(V1): connectivity imposed via adjacency masks, laminar organization, and graded inhibition representing inhibitory neurons. At the functional level, we implement biologically inspired learning: Hebbian synaptic plasticity with homeostatic regulation, Layer Normalization, data augmentation to model exposure to natural variability in sensory input, and synaptic noise to model neural stochasticity. We also include convolutional layers for spatial processing, mimicking retinotopic mapping. The model performance is evaluated on the Facial Emotion Recognition task FER-2013 and compared with a conventional baseline. Additionally, we investigate the impacts of each biological feature through a series of ablation experiments. While connectivity was limited to a single cortical column and biologically relevant connections, BioNIC achieved performance comparable to that of conventional models, with an accuracy of 59.77 $\pm$ 0.27% on FER-2013. Our findings demonstrate that integrating constraints derived from connectomics is a computationally plausible approach to developing biologically inspired artificial intelligence systems. This work also highlights the potential of new generation peta-scale connectomics data in advancing both neuroscience modeling and artificial intelligence.

### [247] [Diversifying Toxicity Search in Large Language Models Through Speciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20981)
*Onkar Shelar,Travis Desell*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ToxSearch-S, an evolutionary speciation algorithm for better exploring adversarial prompts for large language models, achieving higher toxicity and semantic diversity than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evolutionary prompt search techniques often collapse to a small set of high-performing prompts, limiting their ability to uncover diverse and distinct failure modes in large language models (LLMs).

Method: ToxSearch-S introduces a speciated quality-diversity search methodology maintaining multiple prompt niches. It includes features like exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers, and species-aware parent selection to promote both within-niche optimization and cross-niche exploration.

Result: ToxSearch-S delivers higher peak toxicity and broader semantic coverage than baseline methods. It forms behaviorally distinct prompt niches in embedding space, enabling exploration of diverse adversarial attack strategies.

Conclusion: The speciation approach in ToxSearch-S effectively improves the coverage and diversity of failure modes in LLMs, offering a broader range of adversarial prompts and attack strategies compared to standard methods.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt search is a practical black-box approach for red teaming large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often collapse onto a small family of high-performing prompts, limiting coverage of distinct failure modes. We present a speciated quality-diversity (QD) extension of ToxSearch that maintains multiple high-toxicity prompt niches in parallel rather than optimizing a single best prompt. ToxSearch-S introduces unsupervised prompt speciation via a search methodology that maintains capacity-limited species with exemplar leaders, a reserve pool for outliers and emerging niches, and species-aware parent selection that trades off within-niche exploitation and cross-niche exploration. ToxSearch-S is found to reach higher peak toxicity ($\approx 0.73$ vs.\ $\approx 0.47$) and a extreme heavier tail (top-10 median $0.66$ vs.\ $0.45$) than the baseline, while maintaining comparable performance on moderately toxic prompts. Speciation also yields broader semantic coverage under a topic-as-species analysis (higher effective topic diversity $N_1$ and larger unique topic coverage $K$). Finally, species formed are well-separated in embedding space (mean separation ratio $\approx 1.93$) and exhibit distinct toxicity distributions, indicating that speciation partitions the adversarial space into behaviorally differentiated niches rather than superficial lexical variants. This suggests our approach uncovers a wider range of attack strategies.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: BrainFuse bridges the gap between AI and neuroscience by providing a unified platform for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of synergy between neuroscience and AI due to infrastructural incompatibilities, such as AI frameworks lacking biophysical realism and neural tools being poorly suited for AI deployment.

Method: Developed BrainFuse, integrating detailed neuronal dynamics into a GPU-optimized and gradient-based framework, compatible with neuromorphic hardware.

Result: BrainFuse achieves up to 3,000x acceleration, scalable support for Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with low power consumption, and enhanced AI functionalities like robustness to noise and temporal processing.

Conclusion: BrainFuse facilitates interdisciplinary research and promotes the development of next-gen bio-inspired intelligent systems by bridging AI and neuroscience technologies.

Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence represent distinct yet complementary pathways to general intelligence. However, amid the ongoing boom in AI research and applications, the translational synergy between these two fields has grown increasingly elusive-hampered by a widening infrastructural incompatibility: modern AI frameworks lack native support for biophysical realism, while neural simulation tools are poorly suited for gradient-based optimization and neuromorphic hardware deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce BrainFuse, a unified infrastructure that provides comprehensive support for biophysical neural simulation and gradient-based learning. By addressing algorithmic, computational, and deployment challenges, BrainFuse exhibits three core capabilities: (1) algorithmic integration of detailed neuronal dynamics into a differentiable learning framework; (2) system-level optimization that accelerates customizable ion-channel dynamics by up to 3,000x on GPUs; and (3) scalable computation with highly compatible pipelines for neuromorphic hardware deployment. We demonstrate this full-stack design through both AI and neuroscience tasks, from foundational neuron simulation and functional cylinder modeling to real-world deployment and application scenarios. For neuroscience, BrainFuse supports multiscale biological modeling, enabling the deployment of approximately 38,000 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with 100 million synapses on a single neuromorphic chip while consuming as low as 1.98 W. For AI, BrainFuse facilitates the synergistic application of realistic biological neuron models, demonstrating enhanced robustness to input noise and improved temporal processing endowed by complex HH dynamics. BrainFuse therefore serves as a foundational engine to facilitate cross-disciplinary research and accelerate the development of next-generation bio-inspired intelligent systems.

### [249] [Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation: Aligning Language Models Without Ground-Truth Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21268)
*Micah Rentschler,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLME, a reinforcement learning approach for training LLMs using rewards derived from evaluator responses to meta-questions instead of ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers in RL for LLMs are often ambiguous or expensive, hindering scalability. This paper aims to enable training without relying on such labels.

Method: RLME uses meta-questions to evaluate correctness and logical consistency. It converts an evaluator's positive judgment probability into rewards, optimizes the generator with group-relative policy optimization.

Result: RLME achieves comparable performance to label-based training in accuracy and sample efficiency, offers controllable objectives trade-offs, promotes reliable reasoning, and works in open-domain settings.

Conclusion: RLME broadens the applicability of RL for LLMs by allowing training without ground-truth labels, promoting scalability and effective reasoning in ambiguous or label-scarce domains.

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training large language models (LLMs) require ground-truth labels or task-specific verifiers, limiting scalability when correctness is ambiguous or expensive to obtain. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from Meta-Evaluation (RLME), which optimizes a generator using reward derived from an evaluator's answers to natural-language meta-questions (e.g., "Is the answer correct?" or "Is the reasoning logically consistent?"). RLME treats the evaluator's probability of a positive judgment as a reward and updates the generator via group-relative policy optimization, enabling learning without labels. Across a suite of experiments, we show that RLME achieves accuracy and sample efficiency comparable to label-based training, enables controllable trade-offs among multiple objectives, steers models toward reliable reasoning patterns rather than post-hoc rationalization, and generalizes to open-domain settings where ground-truth labels are unavailable, broadening the domains in which LLMs may be trained with RL.

*Zhengzheng Tang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEXUS, a novel framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) achieving bit-exact equivalence to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) without compromising on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy in Spiking Neural Networks, by achieving outputs identical to ANNs.

Method: The authors constructed all operations from pure Integrate-and-Fire neuron logic gates using IEEE-754 floating-point arithmetic, spatial bit encoding, hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits, and surrogate-free STE training.

Result: NEXUS achieved identical task accuracy (0.00% degradation) compared to standard ANNs, with mean ULP error of 6.19 and energy reduction of up to 168,000× on neuromorphic hardware.

Conclusion: NEXUS enables energy-efficient SNNs while eliminating membrane potential leakage and tolerating synaptic noise, ensuring mathematical equivalence to ANNs for accuracy and precision.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient computing through event-driven sparsity, yet all existing approaches sacrifice accuracy by approximating continuous values with discrete spikes. We propose NEXUS, a framework that achieves bit-exact ANN-to-SNN equivalence -- not approximate, but mathematically identical outputs. Our key insight is constructing all arithmetic operations, both linear and nonlinear, from pure IF neuron logic gates that implement IEEE-754 compliant floating-point arithmetic. Through spatial bit encoding (zero encoding error by construction), hierarchical neuromorphic gate circuits (from basic logic gates to complete transformer layers), and surrogate-free STE training (exact identity mapping rather than heuristic approximation), NEXUS produces outputs identical to standard ANNs up to machine precision. Experiments on models up to LLaMA-2 70B demonstrate identical task accuracy (0.00\% degradation) with mean ULP error of only 6.19, while achieving 27-168,000$\times$ energy reduction on neuromorphic hardware. Crucially, spatial bit encoding's single-timestep design renders the framework inherently immune to membrane potential leakage (100\% accuracy across all decay factors $β\in[0.1,1.0]$), while tolerating synaptic noise up to $σ=0.2$ with >98\% gate-level accuracy.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ABOM, an adaptive meta-black-box optimization model, which outperforms traditional methods by learning optimization parameters online and eliminating the dependency on predefined training tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of handcrafted optimizers for complex BBO tasks and eliminate the dependency on predefined task distributions in metaBBO methods.

Method: ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism that updates its evolutionary operators online using optimization data from the target task, without requiring handcrafted training tasks.

Result: ABOM demonstrates competitive results in synthetic benchmarks and real-world path planning problems while eliminating prior requirements for predefined tasks.

Conclusion: ABOM enables zero-shot optimization with statistically significant search behavior, offering a robust solution for BBO tasks.

Abstract: Handcrafted optimizers become prohibitively inefficient for complex black-box optimization (BBO) tasks. MetaBBO addresses this challenge by meta-learning to automatically configure optimizers for low-level BBO tasks, thereby eliminating heuristic dependencies. However, existing methods typically require extensive handcrafted training tasks to learn meta-strategies that generalize to target tasks, which poses a critical limitation for realistic applications with unknown task distributions. To overcome the issue, we propose the Adaptive meta Black-box Optimization Model (ABOM), which performs online parameter adaptation using solely optimization data from the target task, obviating the need for predefined task distributions. Unlike conventional metaBBO frameworks that decouple meta-training and optimization phases, ABOM introduces a closed-loop adaptive parameter learning mechanism, where parameterized evolutionary operators continuously self-update by leveraging generated populations during optimization. This paradigm shift enables zero-shot optimization: ABOM achieves competitive performance on synthetic BBO benchmarks and realistic unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problems without any handcrafted training tasks. Visualization studies reveal that parameterized evolutionary operators exhibit statistically significant search patterns, including natural selection and genetic recombination.

*Zijie Xu,Zihan Huang,Yiting Dong,Kang Chen,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study focuses on converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for reinforcement learning (RL), specifically addressing poor performance in continuous control tasks due to error amplification. A new mechanism, CRPI, is proposed to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs offer energy efficiency and competitive performance by converting trained ANNs without the need for costly retraining. However, existing methods fail in continuous control within reinforcement learning due to cumulative error amplification.

Method: The paper introduces Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a mechanism to suppress error amplification by carrying over residual membrane potentials across decision steps, improving the performance of SNNs in continuous control tasks.

Result: Experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that CRPI effectively mitigates performance degradation when incorporated into existing ANN-to-SNN conversion pipelines.

Conclusion: CRPI successfully addresses error amplification in ANN-to-SNN conversion for continuous control. The work underscores the significance of continuous control as a challenging benchmark and highlights the potential of lightweight methods like CRPI for overcoming these challenges.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can achieve competitive performance by converting already existing well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), avoiding further costly training. This property is particularly attractive in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where training through environment interaction is expensive and potentially unsafe. However, existing conversion methods perform poorly in continuous control, where suitable baselines are largely absent. We identify error amplification as the key cause: small action approximation errors become temporally correlated across decision steps, inducing cumulative state distribution shift and severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Step Residual Potential Initialization (CRPI), a lightweight training-free mechanism that carries over residual membrane potentials across decision steps to suppress temporally correlated errors. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks with both vector and visual observations demonstrate that CRPI can be integrated into existing conversion pipelines and substantially recovers lost performance. Our results highlight continuous control as a critical and challenging benchmark for ANN-to-SNN conversion, where small errors can be strongly amplified and impact performance.

Motivation: Mainstream SNNs struggle with spike non-differentiability, biological plausibility, and performance-efficiency trade-offs while ignoring predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism.

Method: The authors introduce a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron model that uses internal prediction currents based on input-output history to modulate membrane potential.

Result: The method achieves consistent performance improvements across various architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks.

Conclusion: This biologically inspired design addresses SNN training challenges effectively and proves broadly applicable to enhance SNN performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly energy-efficient due to event-driven, sparse computation, but their training is challenged by spike non-differentiability and trade-offs among performance, efficiency, and biological plausibility. Crucially, mainstream SNNs ignore predictive coding, a core cortical mechanism where the brain predicts inputs and encodes errors for efficient perception. Inspired by this, we propose a self-prediction enhanced spiking neuron method that generates an internal prediction current from its input-output history to modulate membrane potential. This design offers dual advantages, it creates a continuous gradient path that alleviates vanishing gradients and boosts training stability and accuracy, while also aligning with biological principles, which resembles distal dendritic modulation and error-driven synaptic plasticity. Experiments show consistent performance gains across diverse architectures, neuron types, time steps, and tasks demonstrating broad applicability for enhancing SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-crafted benchmarks for black-box optimization may introduce biases and limit diversity. Automation can address these issues, enhance objectivity, and reduce manual intervention.

Method: EoB formulates benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem, leveraging a large language model to iteratively evolve benchmark programs, with objectives of maximizing landscape diversity and algorithm differentiation.

Result: EoB demonstrates competitive performance across various domains including benchmarking algorithms, aiding training/testing of learning-assisted methods, and serving as proxies for complex real-world problems.

Conclusion: EoB is validated as a robust and versatile approach for automated benchmark design in black-box optimization, offering enhanced diversity and reduced reliance on expert-crafted benchmarks.

Abstract: Benchmark Design in Black-Box Optimization (BBO) is a fundamental yet open-ended topic. Early BBO benchmarks are predominantly human-crafted, introducing expert bias and constraining diversity. Automating this design process can relieve the human-in-the-loop burden while enhancing diversity and objectivity. We propose Evolution of Benchmark (EoB), an automated BBO benchmark designer empowered by the large language model (LLM) and its program evolution capability. Specifically, we formulate benchmark design as a bi-objective optimization problem towards maximizing (i) landscape diversity and (ii) algorithm-differentiation ability across a portfolio of BBO solvers. Under this paradigm, EoB iteratively prompts LLM to evolve a population of benchmark programs and employs a reflection-based scheme to co-evolve the landscape and its corresponding program. Comprehensive experiments validate our EoB is a competitive candidate in multi-dimensional usages: 1) Benchmarking BBO algorithms; 2) Training and testing learning-assisted BBO algorithms; 3) Extending proxy for expensive real-world problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOEAs often struggle with computational inefficiency in industrial problems requiring many fitness evaluations. The study aims to address this by improving convergence speed using surrogate modelling.

Method: The proposed approach integrates an adaptive surrogate model into MOEAs using a two-loop architecture. The inner loop uses machine learning models like Gaussian Process Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression to approximate fitness evaluations.

Result: The approach demonstrated significantly improved early-stage convergence speeds on 31 benchmark problems and a real-world application in modelling North Sea fish abundance.

Conclusion: Adaptive surrogate modelling can effectively enhance the efficiency of MOEAs by reducing computational overhead in their early optimization phases.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have proven effective at solving Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems (MOOPs). However, their performance can be significantly hindered when applied to computationally intensive industrial problems. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive surrogate modelling approach designed to accelerate the early-stage convergence speed of state-of-the-art MOEAs. This is important because it ensures that a solver can identify optimal or near-optimal solutions with relatively few fitness function evaluations, thereby saving both time and computational resources. Our method employs a two-loop architecture. The outer loop runs a (baseline) host MOEA which carries out true fitness evaluations. The inner loop contains an Adaptive Accelerator that leverages data-driven machine learning (ML) surrogate models to approximate fitness functions. Integrated with NSGA-II and MOEA/D, our approach was tested on 31 widely known benchmark problems and a real-world North Sea fish abundance modelling case study. The results demonstrate that by incorporating Gaussian Process Regression, one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks, and Random Forest Regression, our proposed approach significantly accelerates the convergence speed of MOEAs in the early phases of optimisation.

Conclusion: LDG-EA balances diversity of solutions and quality within practical computational limits, offering a versatile design tool for optical engineering.

Abstract: Designing high-performance optical lenses entails exploring a high-dimensional, tightly constrained space of surface curvatures, glass choices, element thicknesses, and spacings. In practice, standard optimizers (e.g., gradient-based local search and evolutionary strategies) often converge to a single local optimum, overlooking many comparably good alternatives that matter for downstream engineering decisions. We propose the Lens Descriptor-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (LDG-EA), a two-stage framework for multimodal lens optimization. LDG-EA first partitions the design space into behavior descriptors defined by curvature-sign patterns and material indices, then learns a probabilistic model over descriptors to allocate evaluations toward promising regions. Within each descriptor, LDG-EA applies the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm with covariance-matrix self-adaptation to recover multiple distinct local minima, optionally followed by gradient-based refinement. On a 24-variable (18 continuous and 6 integer), six-element Double-Gauss topology, LDG-EA generates on average around 14500 candidate minima spanning 636 unique descriptors, an order of magnitude more than a CMA-ES baseline, while keeping wall-clock time at one hour scale. Although the best LDG-EA design is slightly worse than a fine-tuned reference lens, it remains in the same performance range. Overall, the proposed LDG-EA produces a diverse set of solutions while maintaining competitive quality within practical computational budgets and wall-clock time.

Conclusion: The SMT Solver-based pipelining outperforms existing methods and provides valuable diagnostic feedback to programmers and processor designers.

Abstract: Software Pipelining is a classic and important loop-optimization for VLIW processors. It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible.

### [258] [Quick Heuristic Validation of Edges in Dynamic Roadmap Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20968)
*Yulie Arad,Stav Ashur,Nancy M. Amato*

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance roadmap adjustments for robot motion planning in environments that are dynamic or non-static, by improving the speed and accuracy of edge validity checks.

Method: It introduces the 'Red-Green-Gray' paradigm as an adaptation of the SPITE method. The approach uses computational geometry techniques and semi-lazy checks to classify edges of a roadmap as valid, invalid, or ambiguous.

Result: Preliminary experimental results show that their method improves accuracy in edge classification and effectively labels invalid edges, performing comparably in runtime to existing methods like those of Leven and Hutchinson.

Conclusion: The new method demonstrates promise in both accuracy and efficiency, addressing roadmap validation in dynamic environments effectively, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.

*Youngim Nam,Jungbin Kim,Kyungtae Kang,Cheolhyeon Kwon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a track-centric framework for optimizing trajectories in autonomous racing, overcoming challenges of uncertain dynamics, and improving lap times significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus mostly on dynamics learning at the tracking level without updating trajectories to account for learned dynamics, limiting overall performance improvement in minimizing lap times.

Method: An iterative track-centric approach combines track-agnostic trajectory representation via wavelet transforms, Bayesian optimization for efficient exploration, and simulations with learned dynamics for lap time evaluation.

Result: Validated through simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed framework achieved up to a 20.7% improvement in lap time compared to a nominal baseline and outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses challenges in autonomous racing by optimizing full-horizon trajectories under uncertain dynamics, showcasing significant performance gains and practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The results show that WheelArm-Sim enables effective synthetic data collection for machine learning applications in integrated control systems.

Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of current public datasets in predictive maintenance and safety assessment for AI systems, such as reliance on simulated data, single-modality sensing, and lack of detailed annotations.

Method: The researchers created InspecSafe-V1, a multimodal benchmark dataset collected from 41 inspection robots across 2,239 real inspection sites, with pixel-level annotations, safety labels, and seven sensing modalities.

Result: InspecSafe-V1 offers data from diverse industrial scenarios with multimodal sensing (e.g., infrared, audio, radar, gas) and annotations to enable robust safety assessment and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: InspecSafe-V1 provides a valuable resource for advancing industrial foundation models in safety and anomaly detection, addressing gaps in existing datasets by leveraging real-world operations and multimodal data collection.

Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

*Hao Cheng,Feitian Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust control framework for robotic blimps, combating wind disturbances using a combination of a moving horizon estimator and a model predictive controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic blimps face challenges in maintaining stability under wind disturbances despite their safe operation and long endurance, creating a need for disturbance-aware control mechanisms.

Method: The authors utilized a moving horizon estimator (MHE) to estimate wind perturbations, feeding these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC). A 2-DoF moving-mass mechanism was integrated for robust heading and attitude regulation.

Result: Flight experiments demonstrated that the MHE-MPC approach significantly outperformed traditional PID control under headwind and crosswind conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed MHE-MPC framework effectively enhances the stability and trajectory control of robotic blimps in wind-affected environments, providing a significant improvement over baseline approaches.

Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies and fragmentation in synthetic data generation pipelines, which hinder scalable data generation for training foundation models.

Method: Nimbus uses a modular four-layer architecture with asynchronous trajectory planning, rendering, and storage. It employs dynamic scheduling, load balancing, fault tolerance, and backend-specific optimization.

Result: Nimbus demonstrates a 2-3X improvement in throughput compared to baselines and ensures robustness in distributed environments.

Conclusion: Nimbus provides a scalable, unified framework for synthetic data generation, supporting diverse pipelines and enabling efficient foundation model training.

Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extension of diffusion-based policies to multi-task scenarios faces challenges in scaling model size and demonstrations.

Method: SMP employs a compact orthogonal skill basis, sticky routing for activating a subset of experts, and a variational training objective. It uses adaptive expert activation for fast inference.

Result: SMP demonstrated higher success rates and lower inference costs in simulation and real-world dual-arm platform tasks compared to diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: SMP provides a scalable and transferable solution for multi-task robot manipulation by learning reusable skills, activating only required ones, and adapting quickly to new tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of ensuring safety and performance reliability in control systems operating under black-box, unknown dynamic environments, where traditional model-based methods may fail.

Method: The method combines Hamilton-Jacobi reachability with model-free learning. It trains two neural networks using contraction-based losses to approximate the safety value and its derivative, enabling a learned safety filter for practical application.

Result: Experimental results show reduced pre-convergence failures, improved learning speed, and higher returns across diverse dynamical systems, including hybrid systems, compared to strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Deep QP Safety Filter is both theoretically principled and practically effective for safe, model-free control in various dynamical environments.

Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems -- even including a hybrid system -- and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.

*Wei Zuo,Chengyang Li,Yikun Wang,Bingyang Cheng,Zeyi Ren,Shuai Wang,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Yik-Chung Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework, HPTune, to improve parameter tuning in MPC-based motion planners, enhancing adaptability and performance in complex settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MPC parameter tuning methods are inefficient due to their dependency on executed actions and the sparsity of failure events, such as collisions or obstacle nearness.

Method: The proposed HPTune framework integrates a two-level tuning approach: fast-level tuning using predictive risk indicators and slow-level tuning employing extended evaluation loss with closed-loop backpropagation. It also incorporates Doppler LiDAR for better motion prediction.

Result: HPTune demonstrated superior efficiency and adaptability in tuning MPC parameters on high-fidelity simulations compared to various baseline methods, showing improved performance in dynamic and complex environments.

Conclusion: HPTune enables more effective and proactive parameter tuning for MPC motion planners, resulting in safer and more agile motion strategies tailored to varying situations.

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.

*Weidong Huang,Zhehan Li,Hangxin Liu,Biao Hou,Yao Su,Jingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores a reinforcement learning approach combining off-policy and model-based methods for efficient humanoid locomotion across training and adaptation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of on-policy reinforcement learning, such as low sample efficiency, and to bridge the gap between scalable pretraining and efficient fine-tuning for humanoid robots.

Method: Utilization of off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with large-batch updates and high Update-To-Data ratios for pretraining. For adaptation, deterministic policy execution is used for data collection, while exploration is confined to a physics-informed world model.

Result: The method enables zero-shot deployment of pre-trained policies to real robots and effective fine-tuning in new or out-of-distribution tasks while maintaining safety.

Conclusion: This approach balances computational efficiency in pretraining and sample efficiency during adaptation, making it well-suited for humanoid locomotion challenges.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art robotic systems struggling with sparse rewards, slow adaptation, and high-dimensional action spaces, especially in space environments.

Method: Utilizing a reinforcement learning approach based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) within a learned latent manifold that integrates multiple modalities for structured policy decision-making.

Result: Achieved over 95% task success in single-shot manipulation tasks within less than 1 million environment steps, showcasing faster convergence and robustness to varied conditions compared to visual baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning in latent space improves learning efficiency and adaptability, offering promising directions for robotic grasping in extreme space scenarios while identifying areas requiring further study.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, yet many state-of-the-art systems still struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond carefully curated training scenarios. We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.

*Weitao An,Qi Liu,Chenghao Xu,Jiayi Chai,Xu Yang,Kun Wei,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSCD-Nav, a navigation mechanism for robots that improves decision-making by incorporating a dual-stance debate and arbitration process to better handle uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reliability and efficiency in indoor navigation of household robots, addressing the issues of overconfidence and redundant exploration in existing systems.

Method: The proposed DSCD-Nav mechanism uses two distinct stances—Task-Scene Understanding (prioritizing goal progress) and Safety-Information Balancing (focusing on risk and information value). These stances engage in a debate and cross-check arguments, with a Navigation Consensus Arbitration agent consolidating decisions.

Result: DSCD-Nav enhances success rates, path efficiency, and reduces redundant exploration in experiments on datasets like HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D.

Conclusion: The introduction of stance-based debate and arbitration significantly improves decision-making reliability and efficiency in robot navigation under partially observable indoor environments.

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments is crucial for household service robots. Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for interfacing Lie group integrators with standard multibody system dynamics formulations and outlines a method to incorporate rigid body motion geometry in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing singularity-free time integration methods struggle to integrate standard equations of motion into multibody systems simulation codes without major changes.

Method: A framework utilizing Lie groups (SO(3)xR3 and SE(3)) and a local-global transition (LGT) map was developed to merge Lie group integrators with standard equations of motion in multibody systems.

Result: The presented methodology enables integration of the rigid body motion geometry via Lie groups and bridges compatibility between Lie group methods and standard multibody system formulations.

Conclusion: This approach enhances multibody system simulations by leveraging Lie group properties without requiring the restructuring of existing simulation codes.

Abstract: A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

### [273] [Spotlighting Task-Relevant Features: Object-Centric Representations for Better Generalization in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21416)
*Alexandre Chapin,Bruno Machado,Emmanuel Dellandréa,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR) for robotic manipulation, which outperform traditional features in generalization under visual changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual representations for robotic manipulation mix relevant and irrelevant information, causing poor generalization under shifts in visual conditions.

Method: The paper introduces SBOCR, a representation that groups dense features into object-like entities to reduce noise while retaining task-relevant information. It benchmarks SBOCR against global and dense features across simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

Result: SBOCR-based policies demonstrate superior generalization compared to global and dense representations, even without task-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: SBOCR offers a promising approach for designing visual systems that enhance generalization capabilities in real-world robotic environments.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

TL;DR: This paper proposes 4D-CAAL, a framework for calibrating and auto-labeling 4D radar and cameras, solving challenges in correspondence establishment and annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the difficulty in integrating 4D radar with cameras due to challenges in extrinsic calibration and labor-intensive labeling of sparse radar data.

Method: A unified approach using a dual-purpose calibration target (checkerboard for camera and corner reflector for radar) and a correspondence matching algorithm. Auto-labeling transfers annotations via geometric projection and feature optimization.

Result: The framework demonstrates high calibration accuracy and reduces manual annotation effort.

Conclusion: The method accelerates the development of multi-modal perception systems, improving radar-camera integration and automated labeling for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 4D radar has emerged as a critical sensor for autonomous driving, primarily due to its enhanced capabilities in elevation measurement and higher resolution compared to traditional 3D radar. Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.

*Xingyu Zhang,Chaofan Zhang,Boyue Zhang,Zhinan Peng,Shaowei Cui,Shuo Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DexTac is a framework for dexterous manipulation using rich multi-dimensional tactile data extracted from human demonstrations, achieving high success rates in contact-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for dexterous manipulation lack comprehensive tactile data, limiting their ability to handle contact-sensitive tasks effectively.

Method: The authors developed DexTac, which captures multi-dimensional tactile data during kinesthetic teaching and integrates it into a policy network to enable tactile-aware dexterous manipulation.

Result: DexTac achieved a 91.67% success rate in a challenging injection task, outperforming force-only baselines by 31.67% in high-precision scenarios with small syringes.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is essential for robust and human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

*Anna Rothenhäusler,Markus Mazzola,Andreas Look,Raghu Rajan,Joschka Bödecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MatchInformer is a transformer-based approach designed to improve predictions of occluded traffic agents for autonomous vehicles, offering reduced redundancy and more accurate trajectory forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by occluded traffic agents, which create difficulties in downstream planning and increase computational complexity.

Method: The paper introduces MatchInformer, which incorporates Hungarian Matching to enforce one-to-one prediction-ground truth correspondence, decouples heading from motion for better trajectory accuracy, and employs Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate predictions.

Result: Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset show enhanced reasoning about occluded regions and more accurate trajectory predictions compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: MatchInformer offers a significant improvement in handling occluded traffic agents through innovative methods and metrics, improving predictability and interpretability.

Abstract: Occluded traffic agents pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles, as hidden pedestrians or vehicles can appear unexpectedly, yet this problem remains understudied. Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.

*Joonhee Lee,Hyunseung Shin,Jeonggil Ko*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IROS is a new navigation framework for indoor mobile robots that combines efficiency with the semantic reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation methods for indoor mobile robots lack a balance between speed and robust semantic understanding, especially in interpreting human-targeted cues and reasoning about unseen spaces.

Method: IROS uses a Dual Process Theory-inspired approach with two systems: fast, reflexive decisions (System One) and slow, deliberative reasoning (System Two). It efficiently leverages VLM-level reasoning only when necessary by combining lightweight perceptual modules with augmented spatial and textual inputs.

Result: IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuously using VLMs in navigation, validated across five real-world buildings.

Conclusion: IROS achieves efficient, human-like navigation that integrates the robust reasoning of VLMs with real-time operation on embedded hardware.

Abstract: Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.

Result: The system achieved efficient and rapid learning within few trials, accomplishing successful puck interaction tasks in a setup involving the neuromorphic chip and a computer.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that neuroscience-inspired hardware can effectively handle dynamic robotic tasks, bridging the gap between brain-inspired approaches and practical robotic control.

Abstract: Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models are designed for ground systems and fail to accommodate the unique dynamics of aerial manipulation systems. This research aims to address the gap in applying VLA paradigms to UAVs combined with manipulators.

Method: AIR-VLA includes a physics-based simulation, multimodal dataset with 3000 demonstrations, and evaluation metrics to test mainstream VLA and Vision-Language models in aerial tasks.

Result: Experiments confirmed the feasibility of adapting VLA paradigms to aerial systems, revealing strengths and limits in mobility, manipulator control, and planning capabilities.

Conclusion: AIR-VLA sets a new benchmark in aerial robotics research, providing a standardized testbed and dataset for advancing general-purpose aerial manipulation systems.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

*Hao Ju,Shaofei Huang,Hongyu Li,Zihan Ding,Si Liu,Meng Wang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces sound-triggered mobile manipulation using a platform called Habitat-Echo, enabling agents to autonomously act based on auditory events without textual instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulation research is limited by its dependence on predefined textual commands, making agents passive and unable to respond autonomously to dynamic sound-related scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a Habitat-Echo platform integrating acoustic rendering and physical interaction, along with a baseline system comprising high-level task planning and low-level policy models.

Result: The baseline effectively enables agents to detect auditory events and act autonomously, even in complex dual-source acoustic scenarios, overcoming case-by-case instruction needs.

Conclusion: This work broadens the scope of mobile manipulation by empowering agents with auditory-triggered actions, enhancing their autonomy and robustness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Current mobile manipulation research predominantly follows an instruction-driven paradigm, where agents rely on predefined textual commands to execute tasks. However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.

TL;DR: CoFreeVLA addresses safety in dual-arm Vision Language Action (VLA) models by introducing a self-collision risk estimator, reducing collision risk and improving manipulation task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are inadequate for safe dual-arm manipulation due to the lack of self-collision prediction capabilities.

Method: The CoFreeVLA model integrates a self-collision risk estimator derived from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. It uses a combination of pre-training with model-based collision labels and post-training from robot rollouts for calibration.

Result: CoFreeVLA achieves reduced self-collisions and better task success rates in bimanual tasks compared to baseline models, RDT and APEX.

Conclusion: CoFreeVLA provides a safer and more effective approach for dual-arm manipulation in VLA systems by incorporating collision risk management.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects. We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, recovers to safe states via risk-guided adjustments, and shapes policy refinement for safer rollouts. It is pre-trained with model-based collision labels and posttrained on real robot rollouts for calibration. On five bimanual tasks with the PiPER robot arm, CoFreeVLA reduces selfcollisions and improves success rates versus RDT and APEX.

TL;DR: This paper explores efficient reinforcement learning approaches for cloth manipulation, bypassing common computational costs of end-to-end learning by employing careful design choices to reduce model size and training requirements while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics faces challenges in cloth manipulation due to fabrics' high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and tendency for self-occlusion. Analytical solutions are inadequate, and while reinforcement learning shows promise, existing methods are computationally expensive and inefficient due to reliance on end-to-end learning from image-based inputs.

Method: The paper presents an efficient, modular reinforcement learning approach for cloth manipulation, emphasizing design improvements that reduce model size and training time, specifically through simulation-based learning techniques and streamlined modular training pipelines.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in performance on the SoftGym benchmark compared to existing baselines, using a smaller model and reduced computational resources.

Conclusion: Carefully designed modular reinforcement learning approaches can overcome the challenges of cloth manipulation tasks, improving efficiency and making them more feasible for real-world deployment with fewer computational demands.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

Conclusion: GAZELOAD is a valuable tool for advancing mental workload estimation technologies and examining environmental effects in industrial collaboration setups.

Abstract: This article describes GAZELOAD, a multimodal dataset for mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration. The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses. The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing hybrid planner switching frameworks, such as unreliable mode transitions and inefficiency in congested environments.

Method: It employs large language models (LLMs) for scene understanding and integrates this into joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that LAP surpasses benchmark methods in driving efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: LAP allows autonomous vehicles to achieve efficient, safe driving by reliably adapting to traffic complexities and improving hybrid planner performance.

Abstract: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexities and scalability issues in manipulation systems with high degrees of freedom (DOF).

Method: Development of a modular MANTA-RAY system that uses a PID controller for geometric transformations and distributed object manipulation across modules.

Result: The system successfully manipulated fragile and varied objects in simulations and experiments, proving scalability and coordinated multi-object handling.

Conclusion: The multi-module MANTA-RAY system enhances scalability and facilitates efficient manipulation, demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world use.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that improves diffusion-based visuomotor policies by reducing task-irrelevant noise in backbone features, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based visuomotor policies perform well but suffer from performance degradation due to noise and redundancy in intermediate features, often introduced by oversized denoising decoders.

Method: The authors introduce Variational Regularization (VR), which applies a Gaussian distribution over backbone features conditioned on a timestep and employs a KL-divergence regularizer to create an adaptive information bottleneck, reducing noise and redundancy.

Result: The VR approach achieves state-of-the-art results with success rate improvements of 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld benchmarks, while also demonstrating effective performance in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Variational Regularization effectively enhances the efficiency and performance of visuomotor policies by addressing task-irrelevant noise, validating its applicability for both simulation and real-world robotic tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for surgical robotic tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness, even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning for surgical robotics faces challenges like data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and high safety requirements. The paper aims to address these challenges with a new learning approach.

Method: The method uses a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with the Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to learn surgical robotic manipulation tasks from stereo endoscopic images and limited demonstrations.

Result: The method showed higher success rates and robustness compared to baseline models, including better performance in challenging conditions, unseen viewpoints, and zero-shot transfer to ex vivo porcine tissue.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for in vivo surgical applications, offering a robust and data-efficient pathway for robotic assistance in complex surgical tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

*Alex S. Miller,Leo McElroy,Jeffrey H. Lang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents the design and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor capable of being folded flat and operational upon deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foldable robots lack continuous rotary motion actuators at the macro-scale, and this paper aims to fill that gap.

Method: The research developed a foldable macro-scale rotary motor using corona discharge for torque production and tested its efficiency and operation.

Result: The prototype demonstrated an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, a top speed of 1440 rpm at -29 kV, and a maximum output torque exceeding 0.15 mN m.

Conclusion: The foldable origami rotary motor successfully merges compact design and effective rotary actuation, establishing a new advancement in foldable robotics.

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

*Jinhao Zhang,Zhexuan Zhou,Huizhe Li,Yichen Lai,Wenlong Xia,Haoming Song,Youmin Gong,Jie Me*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces PocketDP3, a compact yet efficient 3D diffusion policy for robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in existing 3D vision-based diffusion policies, particularly the mismatch between compact point-cloud encoders and large decoders, leading to unnecessary parameter waste.

Method: This study proposes PocketDP3, which uses a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) based on MLP-Mixer blocks, replacing large U-Net decoders. This design reduces size while enabling effective temporal and channel fusion.

Result: PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across simulation benchmarks with fewer than 1% of the parameters of traditional methods and faster inference. Real-world validation confirms its utility and transferability.

Conclusion: PocketDP3 provides an efficient, practical, and scalable solution for robotic manipulation tasks with superior performance and real-time applicability.

Abstract: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

### [292] [ReactEMG Stroke: Healthy-to-Stroke Few-shot Adaptation for sEMG-Based Intent Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22090)
*Runsheng Wang,Katelyn Lee,Xinyue Zhu,Lauren Winterbottom,Dawn M. Nilsen,Joel Stein,Matei Ciocarlie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of using sEMG signals for stroke rehabilitation, proposing a model pretrained on healthy data and fine-tuned for stroke patients, improving detection accuracy and reducing calibration needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke rehabilitation often requires accurate detection of motor intent from paretic muscles using sEMG signals, which is challenging due to variability and lengthy calibration processes.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline that adapts a healthy-pretrained sEMG model to stroke patients using limited subject-specific data, comparing multiple fine-tuning strategies to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Result: Using data from three stroke patients, the best adaptation methods achieved significant improvements in transition accuracy (from 0.42 to 0.61) and raw accuracy (from 0.69 to 0.78).

Conclusion: Transferring pretrained sEMG representations from healthy individuals to stroke patients can significantly reduce calibration and improve detection robustness for real-time applications.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising control signal for assist-as-needed hand rehabilitation after stroke, but detecting intent from paretic muscles often requires lengthy, subject-specific calibration and remains brittle to variability. We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

*Haozhe Xie,Beichen Wen,Jiarui Zheng,Zhaoxi Chen,Fangzhou Hong,Haiwen Diao,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynamicVLA, a framework addressing challenges in dynamic object manipulation by incorporating temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation, along with proposing the DOM benchmark for data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models excel in static scenarios but perform poorly in dynamic object manipulation due to difficulties in rapid perception, continuous control, and temporal reasoning.

Method: The authors design a compact VLA model with a convolutional encoder for faster multimodal inference, implement Continuous Inference for overlapping reasoning and execution, and propose Latent-aware Action Streaming to bridge perception and execution gaps.

Result: DynamicVLA shows significant improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, evaluated using the newly proposed DOM benchmark consisting of synthetic and real-world episodes.

Conclusion: DynamicVLA provides a unified framework for dynamic object manipulation with better efficiency and adaptability, supported by the DOM benchmark for both synthetic and real-world testing.

Abstract: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.

*Bruno Claudino Matias,Savio Freire,Juliana Freitas,Felipe Fronchetti,Kostadin Damevski,Rodrigo Spinola*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) impact software maintainability and evolvability, highlighting their benefits, risks, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing use of LLMs in software tasks like code generation and the need for a systematic understanding of how these tools affect long-term software sustainability.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted using databases (ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, Scopus) covering studies from 2020 to 2024. Qualitative evidence was synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by LLM-assisted tools.

Result: Key findings include benefits such as enhanced code analyzability, debugging, and repair, alongside risks like hallucinated outputs, unstable performance, and limited domain reasoning.

Conclusion: While LLMs promote maintainability and evolvability, they pose significant risks to software sustainability. Responsible adoption with safeguards, comprehensive evaluations, and human oversight is necessary.

Abstract: Context. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability. Responsible adoption requires safeguards, rigorous evaluation, and structured human oversight.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DevOps-Gym, the first-ever benchmark for assessing AI agents' capabilities across the entire DevOps cycle, revealing their significant limitations in handling core DevOps tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in evaluating AI agents across the full DevOps cycle, as existing benchmarks only focus on isolated problems and lack environments/tools necessary for real-world software management.

Method: The authors created DevOps-Gym, an end-to-end benchmark encompassing 700+ real-world tasks from 30+ Java and Go projects. They used a semi-automated data collection mechanism while leveraging expert input for quality assurance.

Result: Experimental evaluation using state-of-the-art models reveals that these AI agents struggle with critical tasks in DevOps such as issue resolving, test generation, monitoring, and build/configuration.

Conclusion: The study exposes the limitations of current AI agents in fully automating the DevOps cycle and underscores the need for further research to advance their capabilities in this domain.

Abstract: Even though demonstrating extraordinary capabilities in code generation and software issue resolving, AI agents' capabilities in the full software DevOps cycle are still unknown. Different from pure code generation, handling the DevOps cycle in real-world software, including developing, deploying, and managing, requires analyzing large-scale projects, understanding dynamic program behaviors, leveraging domain-specific tools, and making sequential decisions. However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated problems and lack environments and tool interfaces for DevOps. We introduce DevOps-Gym, the first end-to-end benchmark for evaluating AI agents across core DevOps workflows: build and configuration, monitoring, issue resolving, and test generation. DevOps-Gym includes 700+ real-world tasks collected from 30+ projects in Java and Go. We develop a semi-automated data collection mechanism with rigorous and non-trivial expert efforts in ensuring the task coverage and quality. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models and agents reveals fundamental limitations: they struggle with issue resolving and test generation in Java and Go, and remain unable to handle new tasks such as monitoring and build and configuration. These results highlight the need for essential research in automating the full DevOps cycle with AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a standardized evaluation framework for assessing the proficiency of AI-driven IDE agents in modern programming tasks.

Method: It introduces a Dockerized test harness equipped with high-level abstractions for tasks like codebase search, file editing, and full-stack application testing. 80 tasks are created across different programming languages and scenarios.

Result: IDE-Bench successfully provides a benchmark that correlates agent intent with project-level task success in a multi-language, full-stack environment.

Conclusion: IDE-Bench enables systematic evaluation of AI IDE agents, ensuring contamination-free testing and improving the assessment of their real-world collaborative capabilities.

Abstract: IDE-Bench is a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI IDE agents on real-world software engineering tasks through an IDE-native tool interface. We present a Dockerized test harness that goes beyond raw terminal execution, granting models a structured tool ecosystem that represents AI-native IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. By providing high-level abstractions for codebase search, structured file editing, and tools for testing full-stack applications, IDE-Bench evaluates an agent's ability to act as a true engineering collaborator. For evaluation and to prevent training data contamination, we created 80 tasks across eight never-published repositories spanning C/C++, Java, and MERN stacks, representing modern tech stack production scenarios, including feature implementation, bug fixing, refactoring, and performance optimization that mirror daily developer workflows in private codebases. Our benchmark is the first to systematically correlate agent-reported intent with successful project-level modifications in a multi-language, full-stack environment on completely uncontaminated code.

### [297] [Another Systematic Review? A Critical Analysis of Systematic Literature Reviews on Agile Effort and Cost Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20893)
*Henry Edison,Nauman Ali*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in software engineering are often redundant due to inadequate justification for new reviews and lack of checks for existing studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in SLR practices by examining why authors conduct new SLRs on well-covered topics, aiming to streamline methodological rigor and progress in software engineering research.

Method: Researchers conducted a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs on the narrow topic of effort estimation in Agile software development, considering justification patterns, citation data, publication details, and SLR quality.

Result: Authors tend to justify additional SLRs by pointing to gaps in prior SLRs, methodological limitations, outdated information, or rapid advancements in the field.

Conclusion: Software engineering research could benefit from better validation of new SLR justifications and stricter policies in publication venues to reduce redundant SLRs.

Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.

TL;DR: This paper investigates automating metamodel generation in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with generative AI, showcasing its success in creating domain-specific JSON objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to streamline the DDD process and improve efficiency by utilizing generative AI to automate domain-specific metamodel generation, which is traditionally manual.

Method: The authors used a generative AI model fine-tuned on DDD project data using a 4-bit quantized Code Llama and LoRA on consumer-grade hardware to create accurate JSON objects from simple prompts.

Result: The model achieved high performance, producing syntactically correct JSON objects with minimal post-processing, even with modest hardware.

Conclusion: Generative AI can effectively automate aspects of DDD metamodeling, making the process more efficient and accessible, while opening opportunities for further AI integration into software development.

Abstract: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a key framework for developing customer-oriented software, focusing on the precise modeling of an application's domain. Traditionally, metamodels that describe these domains are created manually by system designers, forming the basis for iterative software development. This paper explores the partial automation of metamodel generation using generative AI, particularly for producing domain-specific JSON objects. By training a model on real-world DDD project data, we demonstrate that generative AI can produce syntactically correct JSON objects based on simple prompts, offering significant potential for streamlining the design process. To address resource constraints, the AI model was fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU using a 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Despite limited hardware, the model achieved high performance, generating accurate JSON objects with minimal post-processing. This research illustrates the viability of incorporating generative AI into the DDD process, improving efficiency and reducing resource requirements, while also laying the groundwork for further advancements in AI-driven software development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of trust in AI-driven software engineering tools and processes by investigating blockchain-enabled methods.

Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) with a well-defined protocol and eligibility criteria was conducted to synthesize research findings on blockchain-enabled trust methods.

Result: The review shows that while AI integration in software engineering is well-studied, only a minor portion (31%) focuses on trustworthiness. Six studies demonstrate blockchain’s role in improving reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted tasks.

Conclusion: Blockchain provides significant benefits in enhancing trustworthiness in AI-related software engineering, but the field needs consistent trust definitions and more real-world testing to establish robust frameworks.

Abstract: Context: Blockchain and AI are increasingly explored to enhance trustworthiness in software engineering (SE), particularly in supporting software evolution tasks. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using a predefined protocol with clear eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and minimized bias, synthesizing research on blockchain-enabled trust in AI-driven SE tools and processes. Results: Most studies focus on integrating AI in SE, with only 31% explicitly addressing trustworthiness. Our review highlights six recent studies exploring blockchain-based approaches to reinforce reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted SE tasks. Conclusion: Blockchain enhances trust by ensuring data immutability, model transparency, and lifecycle accountability, including federated learning with blockchain consensus and private data verification. However, inconsistent definitions of trust and limited real-world testing remain major challenges. Future work must develop measurable, reproducible trust frameworks to enable reliable, secure, and compliant AI-driven SE ecosystems, including applications involving large language models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses inconsistencies in defining "research software" by introducing a taxonomy for empirical research software security studies. It applies this taxonomy for security analysis using repository-centric signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research software is inconsistently defined across empirical studies, complicating their comparison and the interpretation of security risks within the research software supply chain (RSSC).

Method: The paper conducts a scoping review to extract definitions, criteria, and heuristics used in existing research software studies. Using this, it creates a harmonized taxonomy, maps prior approaches, annotates a dataset, and applies security analysis with OpenSSF Scorecard.

Result: A novel RSSC-oriented taxonomy is developed, yielding annotated datasets, a reproducible labeling pipeline, and demonstrating taxonomy-aware security analysis that highlights differences in repository signals.

Conclusion: The taxonomy improves comparability across empirical studies and provides a framework for better interpreting security risks within the RSSC.

Abstract: Empirical studies of research software are hard to compare because the literature operationalizes ``research software'' inconsistently. Motivated by the research software supply chain (RSSC) and its security risks, we introduce an RSSC-oriented taxonomy that makes scope and operational boundaries explicit for empirical research software security studies.
  We conduct a targeted scoping review of recent repository mining and dataset construction studies, extracting each work's definition, inclusion criteria, unit of analysis, and identification heuristics. We synthesize these into a harmonized taxonomy and a mapping that translates prior approaches into shared taxonomy dimensions. We operationalize the taxonomy on a large community-curated corpus from the Research Software Encyclopedia (RSE), producing an annotated dataset, a labeling codebook, and a reproducible labeling pipeline. Finally, we apply OpenSSF Scorecard as a preliminary security analysis to show how repository-centric security signals differ across taxonomy-defined clusters and why taxonomy-aware stratification is necessary for interpreting RSSC security measurements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) in code are insufficient due to gaps in robustness, fairness, and usability, among others. This paper introduces BEHELM, a comprehensive benchmarking infrastructure to evaluate LLMs in software engineering contexts more reliably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies of existing benchmarks for LLMs in software engineering, such as narrow tasks, incomplete metrics, lack of standardization, and absence of robust datasets.

Method: The authors conducted a survey of existing benchmarks and organized a community workshop to identify evaluation gaps. They then developed BEHELM, a benchmarking framework with a multi-metric evaluation system tailored for software engineering applications.

Result: BEHELM provides structured assessments that cover tasks, languages, input/output granularities, and quality dimensions, offering a holistic and standardized approach to benchmarking LLMs.

Conclusion: BEHELM reduces the overhead of creating benchmarks while enabling more reliable, fair, and future-facing evaluations of large language models in software engineering contexts.

Abstract: Large language models for code are advancing fast, yet our ability to evaluate them lags behind. Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. They also suffer from inconsistent data engineering practices, limited software engineering context, and widespread contamination issues. To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop. We identified three core barriers to reliable evaluation: the absence of software-engineering-rich datasets, overreliance on ML-centric metrics, and the lack of standardized, reproducible data pipelines. Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation. BEHELM provides a structured way to assess models across tasks, languages, input and output granularities, and key quality dimensions. Our goal is to reduce the overhead currently required to construct benchmarks while enabling a fair, realistic, and future-proof assessment of LLMs in software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing the rationale behind the acceptance or rejection of silent AI-generated pull requests, which lack contextual cues such as comments and discussions.

Method: Empirical analysis of 4,762 SPRs generated by five AI agents on popular Python repositories from the AIDev dataset, focusing on their impact on code complexity, quality issues, and security vulnerabilities.

Result: Findings offer insights into how factors such as code complexity, quality concerns, and security vulnerabilities may influence the acceptance or rejection of SPRs.

Conclusion: The study provides a quantitative foundation for understanding decision-making processes regarding silent AI pull requests, aiding in transparency and trust in AI-generated code contributions.

Abstract: We present the first empirical study of AI-generated pull requests that are 'silent,' meaning no comments or discussions accompany them. This absence of any comments or discussions associated with such silent AI pull requests (SPRs) poses a unique challenge in understanding the rationale for their acceptance or rejection. Hence, we quantitatively study 4,762 SPRs of five AI agents made to popular Python repositories drawn from the AIDev public dataset. We examine SPRs impact on code complexity, other quality issues, and security vulnerabilities, especially to determine whether these insights can hint at the rationale for acceptance or rejection of SPRs.

### [303] [AI-Assisted Engineering Should Track the Epistemic Status and Temporal Validity of Architectural Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21116)
*Sankalp Gilda,Shlok Gilda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for tracking the epistemic status, aggregation, and decay of architectural decisions in AI-assisted software engineering to ensure reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in distinguishing between verified architectural decisions and conjectures in AI-assisted software engineering, as rapid generation by LLM coding assistants often outpaces validation processes.

Method: The authors propose the First Principles Framework (FPF), which introduces epistemic layers, conservative evidence aggregation using Gödel t-norms, and automated tracking of evidence decay. They define invariants for valid aggregation and conduct an audit to validate the framework.

Result: The application of FPF criteria to two projects revealed that 20-25% of architectural decisions were based on stale evidence within two months, showing the need for mechanisms to ensure temporal validity.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of maintaining temporal and epistemic accountability in AI-assisted systems and suggests future research directions like learnable aggregation operators and SMT-based claim validation.

Abstract: This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation.

### [304] [From Logic to Toolchains: An Empirical Study of Bugs in the TypeScript Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21186)
*TianYi Tang,Saba Alimadadi,Nick Sumner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of TypeScript on software faults through an analysis of 633 bug reports, highlighting a shift from traditional errors to build and integration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how TypeScript impacts the nature and distribution of software faults in real-world projects and understand its implications on modern development.

Method: Analyzed 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source TypeScript projects to identify fault types, measure their prevalence, and assess relationships with project characteristics.

Result: TypeScript projects are dominated by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues, correlating with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity.

Conclusion: While TypeScript mitigates traditional runtime and type errors, it shifts fragility to build systems and toolchains, highlighting the role of language design in shaping fault profiles of software systems.

Abstract: TypeScript has rapidly become a popular language for modern web development, yet its effect on software faults remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the testing practices in human-agent pull requests (HAPRs) versus human pull requests (HPRs), finding differences in extent and emphasis of testing, but no significant differences in test quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and influence of human-agent collaboration on software testing practices, which are poorly understood despite the growing use of AI-based coding agents.

Method: An empirical study comparing 6,582 HAPRs and 3,122 HPRs from the AIDev dataset across three dimensions: testing frequency and extent, types of testing-related changes, and testing quality using metrics like test smells.

Result: HAPRs show a comparable likelihood of including tests but have nearly double the test-to-source line ratio compared to HPRs. HAPRs also tend to add new tests during co-evolution more frequently, while HPRs modify existing tests. Test quality differences are statistically insignificant with minimal effect sizes.

Conclusion: Human-agent collaborations show distinct patterns in testing practices, particularly in test extent and emphasis, but maintain similar test quality compared to human-only efforts.

Abstract: AI-based coding agents are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, collaborating with developers to create pull requests (PRs). Despite their growing adoption, the role of human-agent collaboration in software testing remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality. These insights provide the first characterization of how human-agent collaboration shapes testing practices.

### [306] [CovAgent: Overcoming the 30% Curse of Mobile Application Coverage with Agentic AI and Dynamic Instrumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21253)
*Wei Minn,Biniam Fisseha Demissie,Yan Naing Tun,Jiakun Liu,Mariano Ceccato,Lwin Khin Shar,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CovAgent is an AI-powered framework designed to improve UI test coverage for Android apps. It enhances the effectiveness of existing GUI testing approaches by addressing complex app conditions that hinder app activity coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Android GUI testing techniques struggle with low activity coverage (often below 30%) due to challenges in generating complex user inputs, device configuration issues, and inaccessible code paths. This limitation reduces the reliability of automated testing methods.

Method: CovAgent uses AI agents to analyze the app's Smali code and component transition graph to detect and address conditions that prevent access to certain app activities. Dynamic instrumentation scripts are then generated to fulfill these conditions, augmenting existing GUI fuzzers.

Result: CovAgent significantly improves activity coverage (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3%, and 179.7% over LLMDroid, Fastbot, and APE, respectively) as well as class, method, and line coverage. Further assessments reveal its accuracy and success in addressing activation conditions.

Conclusion: By integrating AI and dynamic instrumentation, CovAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art UI fuzzing techniques, offering a robust solution for achieving higher Android app testing coverage.

Abstract: Automated GUI testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Android apps. However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate.

### [307] [The Role of Social Identity in Shaping Biases Against Minorities in Software Organizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21259)
*Sayma Sultana,London Cavaletto,Bianca Trinkenreich,Amiangshu Bosu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates workplace bias among software engineers using Social Identity Theory, noting prevalent biases in career development and task allocation, with women and marginalized ethnic groups being most impacted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how systemic workplace bias impacts software engineers, addressing an overlooked area compared to other fields.

Method: Researchers conducted a vignette-based survey to measure the prevalence, demographics, motivations, and consequences of biases like career development, task allocation, and identity attacks.

Result: Key findings include women facing career and task selection biases three times more often than men, while marginalized ethnic groups are frequently subjected to identity attacks.

Conclusion: Workplace biases significantly impact software engineers, influenced by gender, ethnicity, age, experience, organization size, and location, with career development and task allocation being the most common forms.

Abstract: While systemic workplace bias is well-documented in non-computing fields, its specific impact on software engineers remains poorly understood. This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization.

### [308] [More Code, Less Reuse: Investigating Code Quality and Reviewer Sentiment towards AI-generated Pull Requests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21276)
*Haoming Huang,Pongchai Jaisri,Shota Shimizu,Lingfeng Chen,Sota Nakashima,Gema Rodríguez-Pérez*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impacts of AI-generated code on software development, focusing beyond pass rates to include maintainability, quality, and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gaps in current metrics that fail to capture long-term maintainability, readability, and human reactions when using LLM Agents for code generation.

Method: The paper evaluates LLM-generated pull requests using code metrics for maintainability and analyzes developer reactions, emotions, and redundancy in code compared to human-generated contributions.

Result: LLM Agents often introduce higher code redundancy than human developers but receive more neutral or positive emotional responses from reviewers, masking long-term quality issues and accumulating technical debt.

Conclusion: LLM-generated pull requests appear plausible on the surface but contribute to technical debt due to redundancy. Improvements in human-AI collaboration can address these shortcomings.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are advancing quickly, with the increasing leveraging of LLM Agents to assist in development tasks such as code generation. While LLM Agents accelerate code generation, studies indicate they may introduce adverse effects on development. However, existing metrics solely measure pass rates, failing to reflect impacts on long-term maintainability and readability, and failing to capture human intuitive evaluations of PR. To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones. This disconnect suggests that the surface-level plausibility of AI code masks redundancy, leading to the silent accumulation of technical debt in real-world development environments. Our research provides insights for improving human-AI collaboration.

### [309] [Detecting Multiple Semantic Concerns in Tangled Code Commits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21298)
*Beomsu Koh,Neil Walkinshaw,Donghwan Shin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using Small Language Models (SLMs) for multi-concern detection in tangled code commits, achieving competitive results while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often create tangled commits containing multiple concerns, which obscure their intent and complicate maintenance. There is a need to explore if language models, especially smaller ones, can detect and untangle these concerns efficiently.

Method: The authors framed multi-concern detection as a multi-label classification problem and used a dataset of artificially tangled commits derived from real-world data. They conducted an empirical study employing SLMs to detect concerns, analyzing the impacts of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and truncation.

Result: The fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM demonstrates competitive performance to state-of-the-art LLMs for single-concern commits and remains effective for up to three concerns. Including commit messages notably boosts detection accuracy by 44% with minimal latency.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively handle tangled commit detection within practical constraints, allowing for accurate and efficient maintenance of version control systems.

Abstract: Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues.

*Mark Looi,Julianne Quinn*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores how professional developers perceive and adopt Generative AI tools, emphasizing the positive impact on productivity and code quality, as well as barriers like security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how Generative AI tools affect software development practices and to understand developers' readiness for adopting these tools.

Method: Studied patterns in usage data of 147 professional developers, analyzing perceived productivity, code quality outcomes, and future adoption intentions.

Result: Frequent and broad usage of AI tools drive perceived productivity and quality improvements. Security concerns act as a barrier, and AI testing tools adoption lags behind coding tools.

Conclusion: A virtuous cycle of AI tool adoption drives improvements, with Enthusiasts leading the adoption process. Policies formalize adoption but have less impact on starting intent among the cautious developers.

Abstract: The rapid advance of Generative AI into software development prompts this empirical investigation of perceptual effects on practice. We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.

*Jing Jiang,Liehao Li,Jinyun Hou,Xin Tan,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes developer interaction with AI-assisted programming tools to understand why they accept or reject code suggestions, introducing the CSAP model for improving suggestion acceptance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of quantitative analysis on developer acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions due to limitations in existing proprietary data, and to enhance AI programming tools’ practical utility.

Method: The study examines 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions, analyzing features distinguishing accepted from rejected code suggestions. A predictive model named CSAP is introduced and evaluated for its accuracy in predicting suggestion acceptance.

Result: CSAP achieves accuracies of 0.973 (imbalanced dataset) and 0.922 (balanced dataset), outperforming a large language model baseline and an industrial filter significantly, showing improvements in prediction accuracy from 12.6% to 140.1%.

Conclusion: This study highlights the value of targeted personalization in filtering code suggestions to reduce developer interruptions and presents the first large-scale quantitative research on this topic, opening new research directions for AI-assisted programming.

Abstract: AI-assisted programming tools are widely adopted, yet their practical utility is often undermined by undesired suggestions that interrupt developer workflows and cause frustration. While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\% and 69.5\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\% and 140.1\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming.

TL;DR: DebateCoder framework enhances reasoning in Small Language Models for code generation using collaborative protocols and debugging, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models face challenges in reasoning and error loops in complex logical tasks, motivating the need for collaborative frameworks to enhance their efficiency and accuracy.

Method: DebateCoder employs role-playing with three agents (User Agent, Technical Agent, Quality Assurance Agent), Adaptive Confidence Gating, multi-turn deliberation, and analytical debugging loops to improve SLM's reasoning and performance.

Result: DebateCoder achieved 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval and reduced API overhead by 35%, outperforming competing frameworks like MapCoder.

Conclusion: Collaborative protocols like DebateCoder can address the reasoning limitations of Small Language Models, offering scalable and efficient solutions for automated code generation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed breakthroughs in automated code generation, Small Language Models (SLMs) often encounter reasoning bottlenecks and failure loops when addressing complex logical requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose DebateCoder, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to improve the reasoning ability of SLMs (e.g., Pangu-1B) in resource-constrained environments. DebateCoder uses a structured role-playing protocol with three agents: User Agent (A_UA), Technical Agent (A_TA), and Quality Assurance Agent (A_QA). It also includes an Adaptive Confidence Gating mechanism with a 95% threshold to balance accuracy and inference efficiency. In addition, we introduce a multi-turn deliberation module and a reviewer-guided analytical debugging loop for orthogonal pre-generation debate and post-generation refinement. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that DebateCoder achieves 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming MapCoder while reducing API overhead by about 35%. These results indicate that collaborative protocols can mitigate limitations of small-parameter models and provide a scalable, efficient approach to high-quality automated software engineering.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of input-dependent and intra-allocation out-of-bound (OOB) memory errors in GPU programs and introduces SCuBA, a compile-time detection tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools fail to detect input-dependent OOBs and intra-allocation OOBs in GPU programs, posing risks to the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software.

Method: SCuBA is developed to analyze CPU and GPU code at compile-time, using a SAT solver to identify OOBs by capturing and evaluating semantic relationships and constraints. It also detects logical partitioning-induced OOBs.

Result: SCuBA successfully detected all elusive memory bugs in a test set of 20 programs, outperforming NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer, which missed 45 bugs.

Conclusion: SCuBA demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of compile-time OOB detection, addressing limitations of runtime techniques and improving GPU program memory safety.

Abstract: Memory safety bugs, such as out-of-bound accesses (OOB) in GPU programs, can compromise the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software. We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.
  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms.

*Adriana Novoa-Hurtado,Rubén Saborido,Francisco Chicano,Manuel Giménez-Medina*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-objective integer linear programming model to improve code quality by reducing cognitive complexity, integrated into a tool for parameterized solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining clear and simple software is essential for minimizing bugs, vulnerabilities, and improving maintainability, especially in complex codebases.

Method: The authors introduced a multi-objective integer linear programming model combined with several developed algorithms to optimize code comprehension by reducing cognitive complexity using SonarSource's metric.

Result: The proposed model successfully reduced cognitive complexity while balancing other criteria like the number of lines of code.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of using a multi-objective optimization model for refactoring code to improve maintenance and comprehension quality, focusing on cognitive complexity reduction.

Abstract: Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.

*Zhijie Zhong,Yuhong Nan,Mingxi Ye,Qing Xue,Jiashui Wang,Xinlei Ying,Long Liu,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces EthCRAFT, an improved tool for detecting blockchain RPC bugs by considering context dependencies and testing across client implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on generating proper blockchain contexts for detecting context-dependent RPC bugs in existing studies.

Method: EthCRAFT generates transactions to form various blockchain contexts, creates context-aware RPC method calls, and cross-references responses from different clients to identify bugs.

Result: EthCRAFT identified multiple new RPC bugs in Ethereum clients, including six previously unknown bugs, some leading to vulnerability bounties and documented fixes.

Conclusion: EthCRAFT outperforms existing methods by providing a novel approach to blockchain client RPC bug detection, emphasizing context-aware analysis.

Abstract: Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.
  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates. Three of our bug reports have been offered a vulnerability bounty by the Ethereum Foundation.

TL;DR: Mobile apps are indispensable but often fail to address age-specific user concerns. This study explores app reviews to understand these issues, achieving robust results through automated and qualitative analyses, with RoBERTa excelling in detecting age discussions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in mobile app usability and inclusivity for users of different age groups, and to gain insights from app reviews to better cater to diverse needs.

Method: The study analyzed app reviews from the Google Play Store, identifying age-related user concerns using manual data curation, machine learning, deep learning, and LLMs, with RoBERTa achieving high precision in detecting age discussions. It also conducted qualitative thematic analysis.

Result: Among 4,163 app reviews, 1,429 were identified as age-related and examined through automated and qualitative analyses. RoBERTa achieved a precision of 92.46% in identifying these reviews, while qualitative analysis revealed six key themes of user concerns.

Conclusion: Effective age-inclusive mobile app development requires understanding user challenges across age groups. Combining machine learning and qualitative analysis can guide developers in addressing these concerns for better user inclusivity.

Abstract: In recent years, mobile applications have become indispensable tools for managing various aspects of life. From enhancing productivity to providing personalized entertainment, mobile apps have revolutionized people's daily routines. Despite this rapid growth and popularity, gaps remain in how these apps address the needs of users from different age groups. Users of varying ages face distinct challenges when interacting with mobile apps, from younger users dealing with inappropriate content to older users having difficulty with usability due to age-related vision and cognition impairments. Although there have been initiatives to create age-inclusive apps, a limited understanding of user perspectives on age-related issues may hinder developers from recognizing specific challenges and implementing effective solutions. In this study, we explore age discussions in app reviews to gain insights into how mobile apps should cater to users across different age groups.We manually curated a dataset of 4,163 app reviews from the Google Play Store and identified 1,429 age-related reviews and 2,734 non-age-related reviews. We employed eight machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to automatically detect age discussions, with RoBERTa performing the best, achieving a precision of 92.46%. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the 1,429 age-related reviews uncovers six dominant themes reflecting user concerns.

### [317] [AtPatch: Debugging Transformers via Hot-Fixing Over-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21695)
*Shihao Weng,Yang Feng,Jincheng Li,Yining Yin,Xiaofei Xie,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces AtPatch, a method to dynamically adjust transformer attention maps, enhancing model fairness and robustness against backdoor attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models affected by backdoors and unfairness often display over-attention to triggers or protected attributes. Existing solutions lack flexibility and can distort features, necessitating a dynamic and non-invasive alternative.

Method: AtPatch identifies anomalous attention patterns during inference using a detector, then selectively redistributes attention maps without requiring model retraining or parameter modification.

Result: AtPatch outperforms existing methods in mitigating backdoor attacks and unfairness while preserving the model's functionality, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: AtPatch offers a flexible, effective, and non-invasive approach to enhance the fairness and security of deployed transformer models.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) affected by backdoor attacks and unfairness typically exhibit anomalous attention patterns, leading to over-attend to backdoor triggers or protected attributes. Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality.

TL;DR: The paper presents a tool for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 code with proprietary extensions (Esope) to Fortran 2008, emphasizing readable output and preserving abstraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in maintaining and modernizing legacy programming languages, specifically FORTRAN 77, in the presence of proprietary extensions amid demands to migrate to newer standards like Fortran 2008.

Method: The method applies model-driven engineering techniques to transform proprietary Esope source code into a target model, which generates easy-to-read Fortran 2008 code while preserving the abstraction provided by Esope.

Result: The tool successfully migrates Esope code to Fortran 2008, ensuring readability and maintaining abstraction. Insights into scalability, maintainability, and adaptability were also discussed.

Conclusion: The approach effectively automates the migration of legacy FORTRAN 77 code with proprietary extensions to Fortran 2008 while addressing readability, abstraction maintenance, and scalability challenges.

Abstract: Legacy programming languages such as FORTRAN 77 still play a vital role in many industrial applications. Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in peer review within software engineering, proposing scalable and inclusive enhancements for sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The peer review system in software engineering faces strain due to increased paper submissions and limited reviewers, hindering research progress.

Method: The paper suggests mechanisms to attract new reviewers, incentivize existing ones, and integrate AI cautiously into the process.

Result: A framework is presented for making the peer review process more scalable, inclusive, and resilient.

Conclusion: Enhancing peer review through training, incentives, and AI integration is vital for the future of software engineering research.

Abstract: Peer review is the main mechanism by which the software engineering community assesses the quality of scientific results. However, the rapid growth of paper submissions in software engineering venues has outpaced the availability of qualified reviewers, creating a growing imbalance that risks constraining and negatively impacting the long-term growth of the Software Engineering (SE) research community. Our vision of the Future of the SE research landscape involves a more scalable, inclusive, and resilient peer review process that incorporates additional mechanisms for: 1) attracting and training newcomers to serve as high-quality reviewers, 2) incentivizing more community members to serve as peer reviewers, and 3) cautiously integrating AI tools to support a high-quality review process.

### [320] [Assessing the Business Process Modeling Competences of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21787)
*Chantale Lauer,Peter Pfeiffer,Alexander Rombach,Nijat Mehdiyev*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the BEF4LLM framework to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for generating BPMN models, revealing their strengths in syntax and pragmatics but challenges in semantics and validity compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic evaluation methods for BPMN models generated by LLMs, despite their potential in automating and enhancing business process modeling.

Method: The authors propose BEF4LLM, a framework for assessing LLM-generated BPMN models based on four quality dimensions: syntactic, pragmatic, semantic, and validity.

Result: The analysis shows that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality but are outperformed by humans in semantic quality. Validity and semantic issues persist, but differences in scores remain modest.

Conclusion: LLMs show competitive potential for BPMN modeling, but improving semantic and validity aspects is vital for their practical implementation.

Abstract: The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

TL;DR: The paper explores the presence and impact of folklore (like myths, informal knowledge, narratives) in software engineering communities, defining its role and providing examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study intends to highlight the implicit narratives and informal knowledge structures in software engineering, aiming to improve understanding and reflective practices in the field.

Method: The methodology involves a literature review, thematic analysis of folklore items, and semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners in Sweden to assess practical relevance.

Result: The research identifies various folklore aspects in software engineering, provides a definition, and highlights how these affect values and collective knowledge in occupational settings.

Conclusion: The study proposes defining software engineering folklore as informal narratives and heuristics that shape collective identity and values, promoting their utility while critiquing unhelpful traditions.

Abstract: We explore the concept of folklore within software engineering, drawing from folklore studies to define and characterize narratives, myths, rituals, humor, and informal knowledge that circulate within software development communities. Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.

*Yifeng Ding,Lingming Zhang*

TL;DR: SWE-Replay is a novel test-time scaling technique for Large Language Model agents in software engineering tasks. It optimizes by reusing prior trajectories and minimizes reliance on potentially noisy value estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling for Large Language Model agents in software engineering is expensive and current methods either lack efficiency or generalizability, often suffering from model miscalibration.

Method: SWE-Replay introduces a novel approach by reusing prior trajectories. It dynamically alternates between exploring from scratch and exploiting archived experiences based on intermediate steps driven by repository exploration potential.

Result: SWE-Replay reduces computational costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or slightly improving performance by up to 3.8%, showing consistent superiority over naive scaling across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SWE-Replay is a robust and efficient test-time scaling solution for software engineering agents, generalizable across different settings without dependency on LLM-based quality estimates.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

### [323] [Differential Dynamic Causal Nets: Model Construction, Identification and Group Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21478)
*Kang You,Gary Green,Jian Zhang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method to construct differential causal networks from EEG data to model brain activity and track disruptions, especially in epilepsy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modelling brain systems at both micro and macro scales is challenging due to the complexities of neuronal interactions and limitations of current approaches.

Method: Developed a novel network method using conditionally coupled neuronal circuits and hierarchical models, with evolutionary optimization for parameter inference.

Result: The method demonstrates effective performance in analysing both synthetic and real EEG data, identifying disruptions in brain connectivity during epileptic episodes.

Conclusion: The approach provides new insights into dynamic brain causality and has potential applications in understanding and addressing neurological disorders like epilepsy.

Abstract: Pathophysiolpgical modelling of brain systems from microscale to macroscale remains difficult in group comparisons partly because of the infeasibility of modelling the interactions of thousands of neurons at the scales involved. Here, to address the challenge, we present a novel approach to construct differential causal networks directly from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed network is based on conditionally coupled neuronal circuits which describe the average behaviour of interacting neuron populations that contribute to observed EEG data. In the network, each node represents a parameterised local neural system while directed edges stand for node-wise connections with transmission parameters. The network is hierarchically structured in the sense that node and edge parameters are varying in subjects but follow a mixed-effects model. A novel evolutionary optimisation algorithm for parameter inference in the proposed method is developed using a loss function derived from Chen-Fliess expansions of stochastic differential equations. The method is demonstrated by application to the fitting of coupled Jansen-Rit local models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real EEG data. In the real EEG data analysis, we track changes in the parameters that characterise dynamic causality within brains that demonstrate epileptic activity. We show evidence of network functional disruptions, due to imbalance of excitatory-inhibitory interneurons and altered epileptic brain connectivity, before and during seizure periods.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study analyzes a state-of-the-art neural foundation model by characterizing its internal neurons' response to stimuli. It uncovers differences in how the model processes information and derives insights for making these models more biologically plausible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inner workings and limitations of neural foundation models in explaining biological brain function through structured analysis of their neurons and processing stages.

Method: The authors use stimulus-response characterizations to analyze the model's neurons and build decoding/encoding manifolds to interpret representational structures at various processing stages, defining metrics like 'tubularity' to assess biological plausibility.

Result: The recurrent module demonstrates major advancements in separating temporal stimulus patterns, although the readout module relies on less biologically plausible methods for high fidelity. The encoder and recurrent modules show distinct representational patterns.

Conclusion: The study identifies potential design improvements for closer alignment of foundation models with biological systems, such as introducing recurrence earlier and reconsidering feature constraints in the readout module.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns. Our 'tubularity' metric quantifies this stimulus-dependent development of neural activity as biologically plausible. The readout module achieves high fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, this study provides a window into the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns. Our findings suggest design changes that could bring neural foundation models into closer alignment with biological systems: introducing recurrence in early encoder stages, and constraining features in the readout module.

*Youguang Chen,George Biros*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent-IMH, a computationally efficient sampling method for Bayesian linear inverse problems, outperforming existing methods in certain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian linear inverse problems with computationally expensive operators require efficient sampling methods. Motivation lies in minimizing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Development of Latent-IMH, which combines latent variable sampling using approximate operators with refinement via exact computations, leveraging an offline computational phase.

Result: Latent-IMH demonstrated improved performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods like NUTS, including being orders of magnitude faster in some scenarios.

Conclusion: Latent-IMH is effective for Bayesian linear inverse problems by achieving significant computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: We study sampling from posterior distributions in Bayesian linear inverse problems where $A$, the parameters to observables operator, is computationally expensive. In many applications, $A$ can be factored in a manner that facilitates the construction of a cost-effective approximation $\tilde{A}$. In this framework, we introduce Latent-IMH, a sampling method based on the Metropolis-Hastings independence (IMH) sampler. Latent-IMH first generates intermediate latent variables using the approximate $\tilde{A}$, and then refines them using the exact $A$. Its primary benefit is that it shifts the computational cost to an offline phase. We theoretically analyze the performance of Latent-IMH using KL divergence and mixing time bounds. Using numerical experiments on several model problems, we show that, under reasonable assumptions, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) in computational efficiency. In some cases, Latent-IMH can be orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: VISTA is a framework for learning causal structures efficiently in high-dimensional settings. It breaks down the problem into smaller subgraphs and integrates them using a voting mechanism with penalties for unreliable edges. It is scalable, model-agnostic, and performs well in diverse data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to learn causal structures from observational data due to high computational demands and complexity in high-dimensional data.

Method: VISTA utilizes Markov Blankets to divide causality learning into subgraph problems. It integrates these subgraphs globally through weighted voting, edge filtering, and acyclicity using Feedback Arc Set. It supports parallelization and is model-agnostic.

Result: VISTA achieved significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other methods in both synthetic and real datasets. Theoretical guarantees, including error bounds and asymptotic consistency, were established.

Conclusion: VISTA is a robust, efficient, and scalable framework for causal structure learning, overcoming challenges in high-dimensional data and demonstrating superior outcomes through experiments.

Abstract: Learning causal structures from observational data remains a fundamental yet computationally intensive task, particularly in high-dimensional settings where existing methods face challenges such as the super-exponential growth of the search space and increasing computational demands. To address this, we introduce VISTA (Voting-based Integration of Subgraph Topologies for Acyclicity), a modular framework that decomposes the global causal structure learning problem into local subgraphs based on Markov Blankets. The global integration is achieved through a weighted voting mechanism that penalizes low-support edges via exponential decay, filters unreliable ones with an adaptive threshold, and ensures acyclicity using a Feedback Arc Set (FAS) algorithm. The framework is model-agnostic, imposing no assumptions on the inductive biases of base learners, is compatible with arbitrary data settings without requiring specific structural forms, and fully supports parallelization. We also theoretically establish finite-sample error bounds for VISTA, and prove its asymptotic consistency under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of VISTA, yielding notable improvements in both accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of base learners.

*Louis Grenioux,RuiKang OuYang,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) which addresses challenges in training Energy-Based Models (EBMs) for score-based generative tasks, showing improved performance and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in training Energy-Based Models (EBMs), such as computational inefficiency in maximum likelihood training and mode blindness in score matching, and to expand their applicability in tasks beyond generation, such as compositional sampling and Boltzmann Generators.

Method: The paper proposes Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF), a method that reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, which avoids mode blindness and remains computationally efficient. It combines this with standard score-based objectives.

Result: DiffCLF was validated through experiments such as Gaussian mixture cases and practical tasks like model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling. The results demonstrated higher fidelity and broader applicability of EBMs trained with DiffCLF compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: DiffCLF provides an efficient and effective approach to train EBMs, enabling them to achieve better energy estimates and wider usability across applications.

Abstract: Score-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable success. While they are usually parameterized by the score, an alternative way is to use a series of time-dependent energy-based models (EBMs), where the score is obtained from the negative input-gradient of the energy. Crucially, EBMs can be leveraged not only for generation, but also for tasks such as compositional sampling or building Boltzmann Generators via Monte Carlo methods. However, training EBMs remains challenging. Direct maximum likelihood is computationally prohibitive due to the need for nested sampling, while score matching, though efficient, suffers from mode blindness. To address these issues, we introduce the Diffusive Classification (DiffCLF) objective, a simple method that avoids blindness while remaining computationally efficient. DiffCLF reframes EBM learning as a supervised classification problem across noise levels, and can be seamlessly combined with standard score-based objectives. We validate the effectiveness of DiffCLF by comparing the estimated energies against ground truth in analytical Gaussian mixture cases, and by applying the trained models to tasks such as model composition and Boltzmann Generator sampling. Our results show that DiffCLF enables EBMs with higher fidelity and broader applicability than existing approaches.

### [328] [Diffusion-based Annealed Boltzmann Generators : benefits, pitfalls and hopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21026)
*Louis Grenioux,Maxence Noble*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores Boltzmann Generators (BGs) based on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC) with diffusion models as a backbone, addressing challenges in sampling equilibrium configurations for high-dimensional and multi-modal targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BG implementations struggle in scenarios with complex targets (e.g., high-dimensional, multi-modal) due to reliance on importance sampling mechanisms and generative models with tractable likelihoods.

Method: This study uses diffusion models combined with annealed Monte Carlo methods to improve BG performance. It compares perfect DMs vs. trained DMs, explores first- and second-order kernels, and proposes a deterministic integration.

Result: With perfect DMs, second-order denoising kernels outperform standard integrations. Deterministic first-order transport maps improve computational performance but require high costs. Learned DMs show difficulties in log-density estimation, leading to performance bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Second-order denoising kernels and deterministic first-order transport maps can enhance aMC-based BGs when perfect DMs are available, but learned DMs need better log-density estimation for practical use.

Abstract: Sampling configurations at thermodynamic equilibrium is a central challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) tackle it by combining a generative model with a Monte Carlo (MC) correction step to obtain asymptotically unbiased samples from an unnormalized target. Most current BGs use classic MC mechanisms such as importance sampling, which both require tractable likelihoods from the backbone model and scale poorly in high-dimensional, multi-modal targets. We study BGs built on annealed Monte Carlo (aMC), which is designed to overcome these limitations by bridging a simple reference to the target through a sequence of intermediate densities. Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models and have already been incorporated into aMC-based recalibration schemes via the diffusion-induced density path, making them appealing backbones for aMC-BGs. We provide an empirical meta-analysis of DM-based aMC-BGs on controlled multi-modal Gaussian mixtures (varying mode separation, number of modes, and dimension), explicitly disentangling inference effects from learning effects by comparing (i) a perfectly learned DM and (ii) a DM trained from data. Even with a perfect DM, standard integrations using only first-order stochastic denoising kernels fail systematically, whereas second-order denoising kernels can substantially improve performance when covariance information is available. We further propose a deterministic aMC integration based on first-order transport maps derived from DMs, which outperforms the stochastic first-order variant at higher computational cost. Finally, in the learned-DM setting, all DM-aMC variants struggle to produce accurate BGs; we trace the main bottleneck to inaccurate DM log-density estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges in complex system analysis, especially calculating failure probabilities efficiently while maintaining decision boundary accuracy.

Method: The method combines adaptive sampling near failure boundaries, strategic clustering, and a locally linear surrogate model based on the Penalized Profile SVM with the Gabriel edited set.

Result: The method shows convergence through theoretical proofs and demonstrates superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art methods on four test problems, as well as an application to the Lotka--Volterra competing species survival model.

Conclusion: This novel method is an efficient and effective approach for modeling failure probabilities in complex systems while balancing computational cost and boundary geometry preservation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning method called the Penalized Profile Support Vector Machine based on the Gabriel edited set for the computation of the probability of failure for a complex system as determined by a threshold condition on a computer model of system behavior. The method is designed to minimize the number of evaluations of the computer model while preserving the geometry of the decision boundary that determines the probability. It employs an adaptive sampling strategy designed to strategically allocate points near the boundary determining failure and builds a locally linear surrogate boundary that remains consistent with its geometry by strategic clustering of training points. We prove two convergence results and we compare the performance of the method against a number of state of the art classification methods on four test problems. We also apply the method to determine the probability of survival using the Lotka--Volterra model for competing species.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand learning dynamics of SGD in high-dimensional settings, especially under varying batch sizes and scaling limits.

Method: Developing an asymptotically exact characterization of SGD dynamics using mean-field equations driven by Poisson processes, and analyzing SME as a Gaussian diffusion approximation.

Result: The analysis reveals that SGD dynamics remain consistent across sub-linear batch sizes under specific learning rate scaling, with distinct dynamics for SGD, SME, and gradient flow models.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed framework to model SGD dynamics, highlighting distinctions and limits across batch sizes, learning rates, and approximation techniques.

Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $κ\asymp n^α$ where $α\in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $α\in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.

Motivation: To address bias and multimodal inaccuracies in posterior scores during training-free conditional generation in diffusion models.

Method: A Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework with variance-reduction schemes such as Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to provide unbiased posterior score estimates.

Result: Achieves 95.6% accuracy on CIFAR-10 conditional generation with 3× lower cost-per-success and demonstrates 1.5× cost-per-success efficiency on ImageNet compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed SMC methodology sets a new benchmark for training-free guidance in conditional generation within diffusion models, excelling in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate, training-free guidance for conditional generation in trained diffusion models. Existing methods typically rely on point-estimates to approximate the posterior score, often resulting in biased approximations that fail to capture multimodality inherent to the reverse process of diffusion models. We propose a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework that constructs an unbiased estimator of $p_θ(y|x_t)$ by integrating over the full denoising distribution via Monte Carlo approximation. To ensure computational tractability, we incorporate variance-reduction schemes based on Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC). Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for training-free guidance on CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation, achieving $95.6\%$ accuracy with $3\times$ lower cost-per-success than baselines.

### [332] [Provably Reliable Classifier Guidance through Cross-entropy Error Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21200)
*Sharan Sahu,Arisina Banerjee,Yuchen Wu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates classifier-guided diffusion models, revealing under smoothness assumptions that classifier errors can control diffusion sampling errors, establishing a theoretical foundation and guidelines for effective model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion models for conditional sampling remains uncertain due to unclear links between classifier training and diffusion guidance.

Method: The study derives mathematical guarantees linking classifier cross-entropy error to guidance vector errors, highlights the importance of classifier smoothness, and constructs counterexamples to demonstrate pitfalls without smoothness.

Result: It quantitatively links classifier cross-entropy errors during training with guidance errors and establishes upper bounds on sampling errors under certain assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical basis for classifier guidance, offering rigorous principles for designing effective classifiers to optimize diffusion models.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models generate conditional samples by augmenting the reverse-time score with the gradient of a learned classifier, yet it remains unclear whether standard classifier training procedures yield effective diffusion guidance. We address this gap by showing that, under mild smoothness assumptions on the classifiers, controlling the cross-entropy error at each diffusion step also controls the error of the resulting guidance vectors: classifiers achieving conditional KL divergence $\varepsilon^2$ from the ground-truth conditional label probabilities induce guidance vectors with mean squared error $\widetilde{O}(d \varepsilon )$. Our result yields an upper bound on the sampling error under classifier guidance and bears resemblance to a reverse log-Sobolev-type inequality. Moreover, we show that the classifier smoothness assumption is essential, by constructing simple counterexamples demonstrating that, without it, control of the guidance vector can fail for almost all distributions. To our knowledge, our work establishes the first quantitative link between classifier training and guidance alignment, yielding both a theoretical foundation for classifier guidance and principled guidelines for classifier selection.

*Dongyue Xie,Wanrong Zhu,Matthew Stephens*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Bayesian generalized linear model approach using mean-field variational inference, which is tuning-free, scalable, and applicable to diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing variational inference methods are often constrained by assumptions (like Gaussian variational) and require different methods for different combinations of likelihood and prior distributions.

Method: The method introduces a mean-field variational inference strategy that optimizes the posterior mean and the prior parameters directly, using methods like L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior predictive performance in sparse logistic regression compared to other prevailing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method serves as a unified and computationally efficient Bayesian inference framework, flexible across exponential family distributions without requiring specific VI formulations.

Abstract: We introduce a flexible empirical Bayes approach for fitting Bayesian generalized linear models. Specifically, we adopt a novel mean-field variational inference (VI) method and the prior is estimated within the VI algorithm, making the method tuning-free. Unlike traditional VI methods that optimize the posterior density function, our approach directly optimizes the posterior mean and prior parameters. This formulation reduces the number of parameters to optimize and enables the use of scalable algorithms such as L-BFGS and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, our method automatically determines the optimal posterior based on the prior and likelihood, distinguishing it from existing VI methods that often assume a Gaussian variational. Our approach represents a unified framework applicable to a wide range of exponential family distributions, removing the need to develop unique VI methods for each combination of likelihood and prior distributions. We apply the framework to solve sparse logistic regression and demonstrate the superior predictive performance of our method in extensive numerical studies, by comparing it to prevalent sparse logistic regression approaches.

### [334] [Bulk-Calibrated Credal Ambiguity Sets: Fast, Tractable Decision Making under Out-of-Sample Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21324)
*Mengqi Chen,Thomas B. Berrett,Theodoros Damoulas,Michele Caprio*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) involving Huber contamination, introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets to achieve a tractable and finite robust objective for handling arbitrary perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Huber contamination models arbitrary perturbations but makes worst-case risk infinite in DRO without strong boundedness assumptions. This motivates finding a tractable DRO framework under minimal assumptions.

Method: The authors propose bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets, isolating high-mass bulk contamination from tails, resulting in a closed-form robust objective and tractable optimization problems for common loss functions.

Result: The proposed framework enables efficient DRO with interpretable tolerance levels, showcasing robustness-accuracy trade-offs across applications (heavy-tailed inventory, house-price regression, text classification).

Conclusion: Bulk-calibrated frameworks improve DRO by resolving Huber contamination issues, translating imprecise probability concepts into practical and efficient optimization objectives.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) minimises the worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set that can capture distributional shifts in out-of-sample environments. While Huber (linear-vacuous) contamination is a classical minimal-assumption model for an $\varepsilon$-fraction of arbitrary perturbations, including it in an ambiguity set can make the worst-case risk infinite and the DRO objective vacuous unless one imposes strong boundedness or support assumptions. We address these challenges by introducing bulk-calibrated credal ambiguity sets: we learn a high-mass bulk set from data while considering contamination inside the bulk and bounding the remaining tail contribution separately. This leads to a closed-form, finite $\mathrm{mean}+\sup$ robust objective and tractable linear or second-order cone programs for common losses and bulk geometries. Through this framework, we highlight and exploit the equivalence between the imprecise probability (IP) notion of upper expectation and the worst-case risk, demonstrating how IP credal sets translate into DRO objectives with interpretable tolerance levels. Experiments on heavy-tailed inventory control, geographically shifted house-price regression, and demographically shifted text classification show competitive robustness-accuracy trade-offs and efficient optimisation times, using Bayesian, frequentist, or empirical reference distributions.

*Erica Zhang,Naomi Sagan,Danny Tse,Fangzhao Zhang,Mert Pilanci,Jose Blanchet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Statsformer is a framework that integrates LLM-derived knowledge into supervised learning, using a guardrailed ensemble architecture to combine linear and nonlinear learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either rely on unvalidated heuristics sensitive to LLM errors or embed semantic information in a single static model. A flexible, robust framework is needed.

Method: Statsformer uses an ensemble approach, embedding LLM-derived feature priors and calibrating their influence through cross-validation.

Result: Statsformer improves performance with informative priors and mitigates impacts from uninformative/misleading LLM guidance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The framework ensures adaptability, robustness against LLM hallucination, and consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: We introduce Statsformer, a principled framework for integrating large language model (LLM)-derived knowledge into supervised statistical learning. Existing approaches are limited in adaptability and scope: they either inject LLM guidance as an unvalidated heuristic, which is sensitive to LLM hallucination, or embed semantic information within a single fixed learner. Statsformer overcomes both limitations through a guardrailed ensemble architecture. We embed LLM-derived feature priors within an ensemble of linear and nonlinear learners, adaptively calibrating their influence via cross-validation. This design yields a flexible system with an oracle-style guarantee that it performs no worse than any convex combination of its in-library base learners, up to statistical error. Empirically, informative priors yield consistent performance improvements, while uninformative or misspecified LLM guidance is automatically downweighted, mitigating the impact of hallucinations across a diverse range of prediction tasks.

*Yizhou Min,Yizhou Lu,Lanqi Li,Zhen Zhang,Jiaye Teng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the measurement standards for uncertainty quantification in conformal prediction, introducing a new metric to prevent deceptive improvements in interval lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate the sufficiency of standard metrics (coverage and interval length) in conformal prediction and highlight possible deceptive outcomes and vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors explore the concept termed 'Prejudicial Trick', derive formal conditions under which it affects interval length, and introduce a new metric, interval stability, supported by empirical evidence.

Result: Prejudicial Trick preserves marginal coverage but misleadingly reduces interval length, introducing vulnerabilities. The proposed interval stability metric effectively counters deceptive optimization tactics.

Conclusion: Conventional evaluation metrics are insufficient, and interval stability is recommended to ensure robust and reliable assessments of conformal prediction methods.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has become a cornerstone of distribution-free uncertainty quantification, conventionally evaluated by its coverage and interval length. This work critically examines the sufficiency of these standard metrics. We demonstrate that the interval length might be deceptively improved through a counter-intuitive approach termed Prejudicial Trick (PT), while the coverage remains valid. Specifically, for any given test sample, PT probabilistically returns an interval, which is either null or constructed using an adjusted confidence level, thereby preserving marginal coverage. While PT potentially yields a deceptively lower interval length, it introduces practical vulnerabilities: the same input can yield completely different prediction intervals across repeated runs of the algorithm. We formally derive the conditions under which PT achieves these misleading improvements and provides extensive empirical evidence across various regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric interval stability which helps detect whether a new CP method implicitly improves the length based on such PT-like techniques.

*Francisco Caldas,Sahil Kumar,Cláudia Soares*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting, enhancing structured temporal pattern preservation and improving forecast quality using spectral decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion processes struggle to preserve structured temporal patterns, such as seasonality, in time-series forecasting, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: The paper proposes a forward diffusion process that decomposes signals into spectral components and applies staged noise injection, maintaining high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies.

Result: The proposed process improves diffuse models' forecasting accuracy across standard benchmarks, while maintaining negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: Spectral decomposition in the diffusion process enhances time-series forecasting performance, offering compatibility with existing diffusion backbones.

Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

### [338] [A Judge-Aware Ranking Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models without Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21817)
*Mingyuan Xu,Xinzi Tan,Jiawei Wu,Doudou Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of uneven reliability among judge LLMs in evaluation tasks and proposes a judge-aware ranking framework to ensure more accurate model quality assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce bias and improve evaluation accuracy in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, as differences in reliability among judge LLMs can distort leaderboard rankings and uncertainty estimates.

Method: The authors propose a judge-aware ranking framework based on the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, introducing discrimination parameters for different judges and jointly estimating model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons, without requiring ground-truth labels.

Result: The method enhances agreement with human preferences, improves data efficiency compared to unweighted baselines, and offers calibrated uncertainty quantification for rankings across multiple benchmarks and a new dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a reliable and efficient evaluation method for LLMs by considering judge-specific differences, leading to more accurate rankings and uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on open-ended tasks without ground-truth labels is increasingly done via the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. A critical but under-modeled issue is that judge LLMs differ substantially in reliability; treating all judges equally can yield biased leaderboards and misleading uncertainty estimates. More data can make evaluation more confidently wrong under misspecified aggregation. We propose a judge-aware ranking framework that extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce model by introducing judge-specific discrimination parameters, jointly estimating latent model quality and judge reliability from pairwise comparisons without reference labels. We establish identifiability up to natural normalizations and prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator, enabling confidence intervals for score differences and rank comparisons. Across multiple public benchmarks and a newly collected dataset, our method improves agreement with human preferences, achieves higher data efficiency than unweighted baselines, and produces calibrated uncertainty quantification for LLM rankings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using latent subspaces in the Riemannian geometry of categorical distribution manifolds to create effective generative models for discrete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and mathematically consistent generative model for discrete data that captures statistical dependencies while reducing redundancies in categorical variables.

Method: The authors define a low-dimensional latent space with a Riemannian geometry, making geodesics straight lines through isometries. This simplifies model training via flow matching.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the reduced latent space successfully captures essential data characteristics for generative modeling.

Conclusion: Utilizing latent spaces in product manifolds of categorical distributions proves effective and efficient for generative modeling, simplifying training while preserving data dependencies.

Abstract: We introduce the use of latent subspaces in the exponential parameter space of product manifolds of categorial distributions, as a tool for learning generative models of discrete data. The low-dimensional latent space encodes statistical dependencies and removes redundant degrees of freedom among the categorial variables. We equip the parameter domain with a Riemannian geometry such that the spaces and distances are related by isometries which enables consistent flow matching. In particular, geodesics become straight lines which makes model training by flow matching effective. Empirical results demonstrate that reduced latent dimensions suffice to represent data for generative modeling.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the stability and long-term behavior of score-based generative models, offering quantitative bounds on sampling errors using stability properties of reverse-time Markov chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental issue of understanding and ensuring stable sampling and error behavior in score-based generative models.

Method: The authors leverage properties like a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition to study and bound errors in the reverse diffusion process of score-based models.

Result: The paper establishes structural conditions for error propagation in backward processes and shows that reverse diffusion dynamics introduce a contraction mechanism that improves sampling stability.

Conclusion: The findings provide a theoretical framework that clarifies the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and informs how errors propagate in these methods, offering quantitative insights into their stability.

Abstract: Understanding the stability and long-time behavior of generative models is a fundamental problem in modern machine learning. This paper provides quantitative bounds on the sampling error of score-based generative models by leveraging stability and forgetting properties of the Markov chain associated with the reverse-time dynamics. Under weak assumptions, we provide the two structural properties to ensure the propagation of initialization and discretization errors of the backward process: a Lyapunov drift condition and a Doeblin-type minorization condition. A practical consequence is quantitative stability of the sampling procedure, as the reverse diffusion dynamics induces a contraction mechanism along the sampling trajectory. Our results clarify the role of stochastic dynamics in score-based models and provide a principled framework for analyzing propagation of errors in such approaches.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper investigates token dynamics in deep Transformers under random initialization focusing on stochastic effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand token behaviors and dynamics in deep Transformers, addressing the limitations of deterministic weight assumptions often used in theories.

Method: Analyzes token dynamics under random initialization noise using diffusion scaling and RMS normalization alongside mathematical proof and numerical experiments.

Result: Finds token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system instead of collapsing to a single cluster with noise preventing deterministic clustering.

Conclusion: Random initialization noise prevents token collapse, promotes interactions, reveals phase transitions, including antipodal formations; noise suppression impairs transformer accuracy.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various domains but understanding the precise token dynamics remains a theoretical challenge. Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sampling from target distributions where the normalizing constant is unknown, leveraging diffusion paths and optimal score estimation.

Method: The authors develop a diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo method and an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler for score estimation, supported by control variate schedules to minimize variance.

Result: The proposed method theoretically guarantees convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust and efficient solution for sampling target distributions, providing both theoretical insights and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: We develop a diffusion-based sampler for target distributions known up to a normalising constant. To this end, we rely on the well-known diffusion path that smoothly interpolates between a (simple) base distribution and the target distribution, widely used in diffusion models. Our approach is based on a practical implementation of diffusion-annealed Langevin Monte Carlo, which approximates the diffusion path with convergence guarantees. We tackle the score estimation problem by developing an efficient sequential Monte Carlo sampler that evolves auxiliary variables from conditional distributions along the path, which provides principled score estimates for time-varying distributions. We further develop novel control variate schedules that minimise the variance of these score estimates. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between privacy preservation and achieving high efficiency in hypothesis testing.

Method: Developed a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds for constructing private test statistics under Gaussian differential privacy.

Result: The private tests achieved asymptotic relative efficiency comparable to non-private tests, demonstrated conservative type I error control, and outperformed existing differential privacy methods in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The testing methodology ensures high-powered and privacy-compliant performance, suitable for applications requiring both statistical power and privacy protection.

Abstract: We develop a near-optimal testing procedure under the framework of Gaussian differential privacy for simple as well as one- and two-sided tests under monotone likelihood ratio conditions. Our mechanism is based on a private mean estimator with data-driven clamping bounds, whose population risk matches the private minimax rate up to logarithmic factors. Using this estimator, we construct private test statistics that achieve the same asymptotic relative efficiency as the non-private, most powerful tests while maintaining conservative type I error control. In addition to our theoretical results, our numerical experiments show that our private tests outperform competing DP methods and offer comparable power to the non-private most powerful tests, even at moderately small sample sizes and privacy loss budgets.

Motivation: Optimizing functions without accessible gradients is computationally challenging due to the need for expensive sampling methods often used in machine learning and statistics.

Result: They established convergence results for their methodology and demonstrated its effectiveness in reward-tuning of energy-based models.

Conclusion: The proposed SMC-based approach offers a computationally efficient alternative for optimizing functions with intractable gradients.

Abstract: The problem of optimising functions with intractable gradients frequently arise in machine learning and statistics, ranging from maximum marginal likelihood estimation procedures to fine-tuning of generative models. Stochastic approximation methods for this class of problems typically require inner sampling loops to obtain (biased) stochastic gradient estimates, which rapidly becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we develop sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers for optimisation of functions with intractable gradients. Our approach replaces expensive inner sampling methods with efficient SMC approximations, which can result in significant computational gains. We establish convergence results for the basic recursions defined by our methodology which SMC samplers approximate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the reward-tuning of energy-based models within various settings.

*Shujaat Khan,Syed Muhammad Atif,Jaeyoung Huh,Syed Saad Azhar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework to enhance ultrasound images by jointly denoising and deconvolving them using a Swin Convolutional U-Net, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM results under various noise conditions and improving segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images face challenges like speckle noise, blur, and scanner/operator artifacts, and supervised methods relying on clean targets or known degradations are impractical.

Method: A blind, self-supervised enhancement approach using Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a physics-guided degradation model, applying patch extraction, convolution with Gaussian PSF, noise injection, and clean-like targets through non-local low-rank denoising.

Result: The method achieves superior PSNR and SSIM compared to existing methods like MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, especially under high noise levels, and improves segmentation quality on ultrasound images.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes robustly across datasets, scanners, and noise types, offering a practical solution for ultrasound image enhancement without relying on supervised assumptions.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) interpretation is hampered by multiplicative speckle, acquisition blur from the point-spread function (PSF), and scanner- and operator-dependent artifacts. Supervised enhancement methods assume access to clean targets or known degradations; conditions rarely met in practice. We present a blind, self-supervised enhancement framework that jointly deconvolves and denoises B-mode images using a Swin Convolutional U-Net trained with a \emph{physics-guided} degradation model. From each training frame, we extract rotated/cropped patches and synthesize inputs by (i) convolving with a Gaussian PSF surrogate and (ii) injecting noise via either spatial additive Gaussian noise or complex Fourier-domain perturbations that emulate phase/magnitude distortions. For US scans, clean-like targets are obtained via non-local low-rank (NLLR) denoising, removing the need for ground truth; for natural images, the originals serve as targets. Trained and validated on UDIAT~B, JNU-IFM, and XPIE Set-P, and evaluated additionally on a 700-image PSFHS test set, the method achieves the highest PSNR/SSIM across Gaussian and speckle noise levels, with margins that widen under stronger corruption. Relative to MSANN, Restormer, and DnCNN, it typically preserves an extra $\sim$1--4\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.15 SSIM in heavy Gaussian noise, and $\sim$2--5\,dB PSNR and 0.05--0.20 SSIM under severe speckle. Controlled PSF studies show reduced FWHM and higher peak gradients, evidence of resolution recovery without edge erosion. Used as a plug-and-play preprocessor, it consistently boosts Dice for fetal head and pubic symphysis segmentation. Overall, the approach offers a practical, assumption-light path to robust US enhancement that generalizes across datasets, scanners, and degradation types.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMD-$k$, a hierarchy of distance metrics for quantum ensembles, providing insights into their statistical trade-offs and applications in quantum machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of distances between quantum state ensembles is limited, necessitating a framework to address quantum measurement constraints while maintaining statistical efficiency and discriminative power.

Method: The authors propose MMD-$k$, a generalization of maximum mean discrepancy for quantum ensembles, with mathematical analysis on statistical efficiency and discriminative power trade-offs. This is evaluated using SWAP-test-based estimators and quantum Wasserstein distance.

Result: MMD-$k$ demonstrates varying sample requirements based on its moment order $k$. Specifically, $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples are needed for fixed $k$, while $Θ(N^3)$ is necessary for full power at $k = N$, compared to $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ for quantum Wasserstein distance.

Conclusion: The study provides structured insights for designing loss functions in quantum machine learning, demonstrated through quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models, balancing sample efficiency and discriminative capabilities.

Abstract: Distance metrics are central to machine learning, yet distances between ensembles of quantum states remain poorly understood due to fundamental quantum measurement constraints. We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural path estimation approach for reconstructing stochastic dynamical systems using variational inference, even in the presence of noisy, nonlinear observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in reconstructing stochastic dynamical systems arises from needing high-fidelity training data, while real-world scenarios involve noisy and nonlinear measurements. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a method to concurrently infer posterior updates and approximate the system dynamics.

Method: A variational inference framework is employed to solve a stochastic control problem for filtering the posterior path measure derived from the Zakai equation. The method uses a generative model that maps prior path measures to posterior measures via controlled diffusion, learning the control through an embedding of noisy observation paths.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates success in learning complex stochastic systems, such as multimodal, chaotic, or high-dimensional dynamical systems, in experiments.

Conclusion: This work provides an advanced methodology for reconstructing and inferring stochastic dynamical systems with noisy observations, showcasing its robustness and applicability to complex systems.

Abstract: The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proves that approximating critical points for certain nonconvex functions is computationally intractable and connects this to the P=NP problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the commonly-held belief that approximation of critical points in nonconvex optimization is tractable, revealing the inherent hardness of the problem.

Method: The authors provide theoretical proofs showing that computing approximate critical points for nonconvex functions, especially specific structured classes, would imply P=NP, thus proving it intractable under existing complexity assumptions.

Result: The study demonstrates the computational intractability of approximating critical points even under relaxed conditions like constant degree polynomials and guaranteed existence of critical points.

Conclusion: Approximation of critical points in nonconvex optimization is a fundamentally hard problem, challenging prevailing perceptions about its tractability.

Abstract: We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.

*Shogo Nakakita*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes sample complexity guarantees for estimating covariance matrices of strongly log-concave distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) and provides comparisons between single-chain ULA and parallel ULA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide theoretical analysis and comparison of sample complexities between single-chain and parallel versions of the unadjusted Langevin algorithm in estimating covariance matrices for specific distributions, highlighting the benefits of bias reduction.

Method: The paper establishes concentration bounds for the covariance matrix estimation using a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates and leverages this to understand sample complexity differences between single-chain and parallel ULA.

Result: The findings indicate that the sample complexity of single-chain ULA is smaller by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and inverse precision, compared to parallel ULA, due to effective bias reduction during burn-in by the single-chain method.

Conclusion: Single-chain ULA is computationally more efficient than embarrassingly parallel ULA for covariance estimation of strongly log-concave distributions, primarily due to better bias management.

Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of strongly log-concave smooth distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.

### [350] [AI-Augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) for Decentralized Environmental Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21126)
*Kooktae Lee,Julian Martinez*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI-enhanced decentralized framework for multi-robot environmental mapping, overcoming limitations in sensing/communication and improving map accuracy in uncertain contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in decentralized environmental mapping where traditional methods falter due to uncertain or biased initial data, necessitating a more adaptive and robust approach.

Method: The authors propose a method blending optimal transport with a dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module for iterative map improvement, self-correction, and better adaptivity to uncertainty while ensuring scalability.

Result: Convergence is theoretically validated under the Wasserstein metric, with simulation results showcasing superior map fidelity and alignment compared to traditional decentralized approaches.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances decentralized mapping performance in dynamic and uncertain environments, offering a viable solution to complex distribution reconstruction challenges.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-augmented decentralized framework for multi-agent (multi-robot) environmental mapping under limited sensing and communication. While conventional coverage formulations achieve effective spatial allocation when an accurate reference map is available, their performance deteriorates under uncertain or biased priors. The proposed method introduces an adaptive and self-correcting mechanism that enables agents to iteratively refine local density estimates within an optimal transport-based framework, ensuring theoretical consistency and scalability. A dual multilayer perceptron (MLP) module enhances adaptivity by inferring local mean-variance statistics and regulating virtual uncertainty for long-unvisited regions, mitigating stagnation around local minima. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves convergence under the Wasserstein metric, while simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AI-augmented Density-Driven Optimal Control consistently achieves robust and precise alignment with the ground-truth density, yielding substantially higher-fidelity reconstruction of complex multi-modal spatial distributions compared with conventional decentralized baselines.

### [351] [VSE: Variational state estimation of complex model-free process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21887)
*Gustav Norén,Anubhab Ghosh,Fredrik Cumlin,Saikat Chatterjee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a variational state estimation (VSE) method using RNNs to estimate states of complex dynamical systems without a physics-based model, and demonstrates its effectiveness in a tracking application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a method for state estimation of complex dynamical systems in scenarios where no suitable physics-based model exists and measurements are nonlinear and noisy.

Method: The method employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to provide a closed-form Gaussian posterior during inference and uses another RNN during learning. Both RNNs train each other using variational inference principles.

Result: The proposed VSE method is applied to a tracking problem involving a stochastic Lorenz system and 2-D camera measurements, proving competitive against a particle filter and a recent data-driven state estimation technique.

Conclusion: VSE provides an effective and computationally simple model-free approach for state estimation of dynamical systems, demonstrating competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.

### [352] [Thompson sampling: Precise arm-pull dynamics and adaptive inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21131)
*Qiyang Han*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper explores the asymptotic behavior of arm-pull counts in Thompson-sampling algorithms, establishing a dichotomy based on arm stability, with implications for inference methods in multi-armed bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional inference methods are often invalid in adaptive sampling, but UCB-type algorithms demonstrate stability where arm-pull counts are deterministic. This paper investigates whether Thompson-sampling algorithms exhibit similar stability properties.

Method: The authors employ an 'inverse process' approach for suboptimal arms and reparametrize processes for optimal arms to study arm-pull dynamics. They utilize advanced mathematical tools like the parabolic Hörmander condition and Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.

Result: They identify a dichotomy: arm-pull counts are deterministic for suboptimal and unique optimal arms, but follow invariant SDE laws for other optimal arms, informing Gaussian and non-Gaussian inference techniques.

Conclusion: This work uncovers the principle of stability linked to statistical noise minimization and guides tractable inference procedures beyond conventional stable regimes.

Abstract: Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.
  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.
  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.
  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic Hörmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.

### [353] [Independent Component Discovery in Temporal Count Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21696)
*Alexandre Chaussard,Anna Bonnet,Sylvain Le Corff*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative framework for analyzing temporal count data, showcasing its capabilities through simulations and a gut microbiome study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for suitable modeling tools for large-scale temporal count data, which current methods may not fully accommodate.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining Poisson log-normal emissions with regime-adaptive dynamics. They introduce an efficient variational inference procedure for parameter estimation and prove model identifiability.

Result: Simulations confirm the model’s ability to recover mixing functions and latent sources effectively. The framework also identifies meaningful microbial co-variation patterns in a microbiome dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances temporal count data analysis by offering disentangled, interpretable components and demonstrating robust representation learning across diverse applications.

Abstract: Advances in data collection are producing growing volumes of temporal count observations, making adapted modeling increasingly necessary. In this work, we introduce a generative framework for independent component analysis of temporal count data, combining regime-adaptive dynamics with Poisson log-normal emissions. The model identifies disentangled components with regime-dependent contributions, enabling representation learning and perturbations analysis. Notably, we establish the identifiability of the model, supporting principled interpretation. To learn the parameters, we propose an efficient amortized variational inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data evaluate recovery of the mixing function and latent sources across diverse settings, while an in vivo longitudinal gut microbiome study reveals microbial co-variation patterns and regime shifts consistent with clinical perturbations.

### [354] [Distributed Causality in the SDG Network: Evidence from Panel VAR and Conditional Independence Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20875)
*Md Muhtasim Munif Fahim,Md Jahid Hasan Imran,Luknath Debnath,Tonmoy Shill,Md. Naim Molla,Ehsanul Bashar Pranto,Md Shafin Sanyan Saad,Md Rezaul Karim*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper uses causal discovery methods to study the interdependencies among 8 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across 168 countries, developing a framework for effective strategic intervention towards achieving SDG targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for structured, data-driven strategies for achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying their interdependencies and causal relationships.

Method: The study applied Panel Vector Autoregression with country-specific fixed effects and PCMCI+ conditional independence testing on 168 countries from 2000 to 2025, analyzing causal relationships among 8 SDGs.

Result: A distributed causal network was identified, with statistically significant relationships (e.g., Education to Inequality r = -0.599; p < 0.05) and the rejection of a 'keystone' SDG. Income levels affected causal impacts, and a tiered priority framework was proposed for SDG intervention.

Conclusion: Coordinated, multi-dimensional interventions are necessary for effective SDG acceleration, rather than pursuing single sequential strategies.

Abstract: The achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is dependent upon strategic resource distribution. We propose a causal discovery framework using Panel Vector Autoregression, along with both country-specific fixed effects and PCMCI+ conditional independence testing on 168 countries (2000-2025) to develop the first complete causal architecture of SDG dependencies. Utilizing 8 strategically chosen SDGs, we identify a distributed causal network (i.e., no single 'hub' SDG), with 10 statistically significant Granger-causal relationships identified as 11 unique direct effects. Education to Inequality is identified as the most statistically significant direct relationship (r = -0.599; p < 0.05), while effect magnitude significantly varies depending on income levels (e.g., high-income: r = -0.65; lower-middle-income: r = -0.06; non-significant). We also reject the idea that there exists a single 'keystone' SDG. Additionally, we offer a proposed tiered priority framework for the SDGs namely, identifying upstream drivers (Education, Growth), enabling goals (Institutions, Energy), and downstream outcomes (Poverty, Health). Therefore, we conclude that effective SDG acceleration can be accomplished through coordinated multi-dimensional intervention(s), and that single-goal sequential strategies are insufficient.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies FjordPhantom malware which targets banking apps in East and Southeast Asia using virtualization and malicious accessibility services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security vulnerabilities in banking apps exploited by FjordPhantom malware for unauthorized data access.

Method: Empirical study analyzing susceptibility, effectiveness of protections, and strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities targeted by FjordPhantom.

Result: The study identified key vulnerabilities in banking apps and evaluated existing protection measures against FjordPhantom attacks.

Conclusion: Recommendations to improve detection and prevention techniques against FjordPhantom and similar malware exploits in banking apps.

Abstract: Android banking applications have revolutionized financial management by allowing users to perform various financial activities through mobile devices. However, this convenience has attracted cybercriminals who exploit security vulnerabilities to access sensitive financial data. FjordPhantom, a malware identified by our industry collaborator, uses virtualization and hooking to bypass the detection of malicious accessibility services, allowing it to conduct keylogging, screen scraping, and unauthorized data access. This malware primarily affects banking and finance apps across East and Southeast Asia region where our industry partner's clients are primarily based in. It requires users to be deceived into installing a secondary malicious component and activating a malicious accessibility service. In our study, we conducted an empirical study on the susceptibility of banking apps in the region to FjordPhantom, analyzed the effectiveness of protective measures currently implemented in those apps, and discussed ways to detect and prevent such attacks by identifying and mitigating the vulnerabilities exploited by this malware.

*Hugo Morvan,Jonas Agholme,Bjorn Eliasson,Katarina Olofsson,Ludger Grote,Fredrik Iredahl,Oleg Sysoev*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the bigMICE package, which adapts the MICE framework for efficient multivariate missing data imputation on big datasets using Apache Spark, addressing memory and computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling missing data in large datasets, such as Swedish medical registries, often results in biased analyses due to inefficiencies in traditional implementations like MICE under computational limitations.

Method: The paper developed bigMICE, integrating the MICE framework with Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML, allowing for controlled memory usage and efficient processing on constrained hardware.

Result: Tests on Swedish medical registries demonstrated improved memory efficiency, faster runtime, and high-quality imputations in very large datasets, even with high missingness proportions.

Conclusion: The bigMICE package is effective for handling missing data in big datasets, providing memory-efficient and reliable imputations, alongside guidelines for its installation and use.

Abstract: Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations.
  To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops.
  The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.

### [357] [Mean-field Variational Bayes for Sparse Probit Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21765)
*Augusto Fasano,Giovanni Rebaudo*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper develops a mean-field variational Bayes approach for Bayesian variable selection in high-dimensional binary outcomes, offering faster and comparable performance to MCMC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses computational challenges in Bayesian variable selection under a high-dimensional dataset by aiming to improve efficiency and scalability beyond MCMC methods.

Method: A mean-field variational Bayes approximation is proposed with closed-form updates for variational factors and a closed-form evidence lower bound. An efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm was developed.

Result: The proposed method identifies important variables accurately and operates orders of magnitude faster than traditional MCMC methods, as validated on simulated and real datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides a computationally efficient and accurate framework for Bayesian variable selection using variational Bayes, achieving a balance between speed and interpretability.

Abstract: We consider Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes under a probit link with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients. Motivated by the computational challenges encountered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in high-dimensional regimes, we develop a mean-field variational Bayes approximation in which all variational factors admit closed-form updates, and the evidence lower bound is available in closed form. This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework. As shown in both simulated and real data applications, the proposed method successfully identifies the important variables and is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

### [358] [A costing framework for fusion power plants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21724)
*Simon Woodruff*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents an evolution of fusion power-plant costing analysis tools, resulting in the open-source framework pyFECONs for cost estimation aligned with industry standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to develop a reliable and standardized costing framework for fusion power plants by consolidating methodologies and introducing advancements based on industry practices.

Method: The study refines prior cost-scaling methods using ARIES-style relations, expands to include indirect cost modeling and cost-reduction pathways, and ultimately transforms to subsystem-specific modeling integrated into an open-source Python tool.

Result: The release of an open-source tool called pyFECONs, implementing advanced costing methods, aligned with the IAEA-GEN-IV framework to provide detailed, transparent, and auditable cost estimates.

Conclusion: The developed framework greatly advances cost estimation for fusion power by combining physics, engineering, and standardized accounting practices, contributing to the industry's progress toward cost-efficient fusion energy.

Abstract: This paper summarizes and consolidates fusion power-plant costing work performed in support of ARPA-E from 2017 through 2024, and documents the evolution of the associated analysis framework from early capital-cost-focused studies to a standards-aligned, auditable costing capability. Early efforts applied ARIES-style cost-scaling relations to generate Nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) estimates and were calibrated through a pilot study with Bechtel and Decysive Systems to benchmark balance-of-plant (BOP) costs and validate plant-level reasonableness from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) perspective. Subsequent work, informed by Lucid Catalyst studies of nuclear cost drivers, expanded the methodology to treat indirect costs explicitly and to evaluate cost-reduction pathways for non-fusion-island systems through design-for-cost practices, modularization, centralized manufacturing, and learning. As ARPA-E's fusion portfolio expanded, these methods were applied across BETHE and GAMOW concepts (and select ALPHA revisits), including enhanced treatment of tritium handling and plant integration supported by Princeton/PPPL expertise. In 2023 the capability was refactored to align with the IAEA-GEN-IV EMWG-EPRI code-of-accounts lineage, while key ARIES-derived scaling relations were replaced by bottom-up subsystem models for dominant fusion cost drivers (e.g., magnets, lasers, power supplies, and power-core components) coupled to physics-informed power balances and engineering-constrained radial builds. These developments were implemented in the spreadsheet-based Fusion Economics code (FECONs) and released as an open-source Python framework (pyFECONs), providing a transparent mapping from subsystem estimates to standardized accounts and a consistent computation of LCOE.
