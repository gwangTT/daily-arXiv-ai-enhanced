### [1] [Multimodal Detection of Fake Reviews using BERT and ResNet-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00020)
*Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru,Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal framework for detecting fake reviews using BERT and ResNet-50 to integrate textual and visual features, achieving an impressive F1-score of 0.934.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge posed by fake or misleading reviews, which undermine trust and transparency in digital commerce.

Method: Proposed a multimodal fake review detection framework utilizing textual features from BERT and visual features from ResNet-50, followed by fusion through a classification head.

Result: Achieved an F1-score of 0.934 on the test set showing superior performance over unimodal baselines. The model successfully identifies inconsistencies in deceptive content.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of multimodal learning for robust fake review detection and offers scalable solutions for maintaining digital trust on online platforms.

Abstract: In the current digital commerce landscape, user-generated reviews play a
critical role in shaping consumer behavior, product reputation, and platform
credibility. However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often
generated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to
trust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models
primarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to
capture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this
gap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed,
integrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted
using ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head
to jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated
dataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery,
hospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized. Experimental results indicate
that the multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving an F1-score
of 0.934 on the test set. Additionally, the confusion matrix and qualitative
analysis highlight the model's ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, such
as exaggerated textual praise paired with unrelated or low-quality images,
commonly found in deceptive content. This study demonstrates the critical role
of multimodal learning in safeguarding digital trust and offers a scalable
solution for content moderation across various online platforms.

### [2] [Graph-Attentive MAPPO for Dynamic Retail Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00039)
*Krishna Kumar Neelakanta Pillai Santha Kumari Amma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for dynamic retail pricing, comparing a standard MAPPO approach with an enhanced graph-attention-based variant (MAPPO+GAT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to optimize retail pricing strategies that adapt to shifting demand while coordinating decisions across related products, addressing challenges in scalability and stability.

Method: Using a simulated pricing environment based on real transaction data, the paper benchmarks MAPPO and MAPPO+GAT for profit, fairness, stability, and training efficiency in a standardized evaluation.

Result: MAPPO provides a reliable foundation for pricing control, while MAPPO+GAT improves performance by leveraging product interaction insights via a graph-based approach, reducing price variability.

Conclusion: Integrating graph-aware strategies into MARL delivers a scalable and robust tool for dynamic pricing in retail, with noticeable advantages over independent learning methods.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing in retail requires policies that adapt to shifting demand
while coordinating decisions across related products. We present a systematic
empirical study of multi-agent reinforcement learning for retail price
optimization, comparing a strong MAPPO baseline with a
graph-attention-augmented variant (MAPPO+GAT) that leverages learned
interactions among products. Using a simulated pricing environment derived from
real transaction data, we evaluate profit, stability across random seeds,
fairness across products, and training efficiency under a standardized
evaluation protocol. The results indicate that MAPPO provides a robust and
reproducible foundation for portfolio-level price control, and that MAPPO+GAT
further enhances performance by sharing information over the product graph
without inducing excessive price volatility. These results indicate that
graph-integrated MARL provides a more scalable and stable solution than
independent learners for dynamic retail pricing, offering practical advantages
in multi-product decision-making.

### [4] [QuantumBench: A Benchmark for Quantum Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00092)
*Shunya Minami,Tatsuya Ishigaki,Ikko Hamamura,Taku Mikuriya,Youmi Ma,Naoaki Okazaki,Hiroya Takamura,Yohichi Suzuki,Tadashi Kadowaki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces QuantumBench, a quantum-specific benchmark for testing large language models' (LLMs) understanding and application in the quantum science domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As the integration of LLMs into scientific tasks grows, there's a pressing need to ensure models can successfully handle domain-specific knowledge, particularly in unique fields like quantum science.

Method: The authors compiled 800 questions from quantum science across nine areas into an eight-option multiple-choice dataset to evaluate how well LLMs perform in understanding quantum concepts.

Result: QuantumBench revealed insights into the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in quantum science, including their sensitivity to question formatting.

Conclusion: QuantumBench serves as the first evaluation dataset specifically targeted at quantum science, aiming to improve the effective application of LLMs in this complex domain.

Abstract: Large language models are now integrated into many scientific workflows,
accelerating data analysis, hypothesis generation, and design space
exploration. In parallel with this growth, there is a growing need to carefully
evaluate whether models accurately capture domain-specific knowledge and
notation, since general-purpose benchmarks rarely reflect these requirements.
This gap is especially clear in quantum science, which features non-intuitive
phenomena and requires advanced mathematics. In this study, we introduce
QuantumBench, a benchmark for the quantum domain that systematically examine
how well LLMs understand and can be applied to this non-intuitive field. Using
publicly available materials, we compiled approximately 800 questions with
their answers spanning nine areas related to quantum science and organized them
into an eight-option multiple-choice dataset. With this benchmark, we evaluate
several existing LLMs and analyze their performance in the quantum domain,
including sensitivity to changes in question format. QuantumBench is the first
LLM evaluation dataset built for the quantum domain, and it is intended to
guide the effective use of LLMs in quantum research.

### [5] [Engineering.ai: A Platform for Teams of AI Engineers in Computational Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00122)
*Ran Xu,Yupeng Qi,Jingsen Feng,Xu Chu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Engineering.ai introduces a system of AI engineers collaborating as specialized agents to autonomously design complex products, validated through UAV wing optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the time and cost associated with traditional multidisciplinary engineering processes by introducing autonomous AI engineering teams.

Method: Engineering.ai employs a hierarchical multi-agent system with specialized AI agents that collaborate using file-mediated communication, memory systems, and integrated computational tools.

Result: The system achieved a 100% success rate in UAV wing optimization tasks across 400 configurations without failures or manual interventions.

Conclusion: Agentic-AI-enabled teams can autonomously perform complex engineering tasks, demonstrating reliability and potential for widespread use in computational design.

Abstract: In modern engineering practice, human engineers collaborate in specialized
teams to design complex products, with each expert completing their respective
tasks while communicating and exchanging results and data with one another.
While this division of expertise is essential for managing multidisciplinary
complexity, it demands substantial development time and cost. Recently, we
introduced OpenFOAMGPT (1.0, 2.0), which functions as an autonomous AI engineer
for computational fluid dynamics, and turbulence.ai, which can conduct
end-to-end research in fluid mechanics draft publications and PhD theses.
Building upon these foundations, we present Engineering.ai, a platform for
teams of AI engineers in computational design. The framework employs a
hierarchical multi-agent architecture where a Chief Engineer coordinates
specialized agents consisting of Aerodynamics, Structural, Acoustic, and
Optimization Engineers, each powered by LLM with domain-specific knowledge.
Agent-agent collaboration is achieved through file-mediated communication for
data provenance and reproducibility, while a comprehensive memory system
maintains project context, execution history, and retrieval-augmented domain
knowledge to ensure reliable decision-making across the workflow. The system
integrates FreeCAD, Gmsh, OpenFOAM, CalculiX, and BPM acoustic analysis,
enabling parallel multidisciplinary simulations while maintaining computational
accuracy. The framework is validated through UAV wing optimization. This work
demonstrates that agentic-AI-enabled AI engineers has the potential to perform
complex engineering tasks autonomously. Remarkably, the automated workflow
achieved a 100% success rate across over 400 parametric configurations, with
zero mesh generation failures, solver convergence issues, or manual
interventions required, validating that the framework is trustworthy.

### [6] [ARC-GEN: A Mimetic Procedural Benchmark Generator for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00162)
*Michael D. Moffitt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARC-GEN, a procedural generator aimed at enhancing the ARC-AGI suite for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the constraint of limited training examples in ARC-AGI and improve skill acquisition efficiency evaluation in artificial intelligence.

Method: The authors developed ARC-GEN, a procedural generator that faithfully extends the ARC-AGI dataset by creating exhaustive and distribution-preserving task examples.

Result: ARC-GEN extends the ARC-AGI training dataset to cover all 400 tasks while mimicking the original data's characteristics, enabling better evaluation of AI systems.

Conclusion: ARC-GEN enhances the ARC-AGI's utility as a benchmark for testing skill acquisition in AI and supports its use in future competitions like the Google Code Golf Championship.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus remains one of the most compelling and
challenging benchmarks for tracking progress toward achieving Artificial
General Intelligence. In contrast to other evaluation datasets designed to
assess an agent's task-specific skills or accumulated knowledge, the ARC-AGI
suite is specifically targeted at measuring skill acquisition efficiency, a
trait that has (so far) been lacking in even the most sophisticated machine
learning systems. For algorithms that require extensive intra-task exemplars, a
significant constraint imposed by ARC-AGI is the modest cardinality of its
demonstration set, comprising a small number of $\langle$ input, output
$\rangle$ grids per task specifying the corresponding transformation. To
embellish the space of viable sample pairs, this paper introduces ARC-GEN, an
open-source procedural generator aimed at extending the original ARC-AGI
training dataset as faithfully as possible. Unlike prior efforts, our generator
is both exhaustive (covering all four-hundred tasks) and mimetic (more closely
honoring the distributional properties and characteristics embodied in the
initial ARC-AGI-1 release). We also discuss the use of this generator in
establishing a static benchmark suite to verify the correctness of programs
submitted to the 2025 Google Code Golf Championship.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in addressing challenges in cognitive science stemming from its interdisciplinary nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the persistent issues in cognitive science surrounding knowledge synthesis, clarity, and integration, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The authors review LLM applications in fields where cognitive science struggles, discussing strengths, limitations, and potential pitfalls.

Result: The study identifies that LLMs can facilitate cross-disciplinary connections, clearer theory formalization, better measurements, integrated models, and capturing variations.

Conclusion: LLMs offer significant promise as complementary tools to enhance cognitive science, but their role should augment human expertise rather than replace it.

Abstract: Cognitive science faces ongoing challenges in knowledge synthesis and
conceptual clarity, in part due to its multifaceted and interdisciplinary
nature. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly the
development of large language models (LLMs), offer tools that may help to
address these issues. This review examines how LLMs can support areas where the
field has historically struggled, including establishing cross-disciplinary
connections, formalizing theories, developing clear measurement taxonomies,
achieving generalizability through integrated modeling frameworks, and
capturing contextual and individual variation. We outline the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in these domains, including potential
pitfalls. Taken together, we conclude that LLMs can serve as tools for a more
integrative and cumulative cognitive science when used judiciously to
complement, rather than replace, human expertise.

### [10] [Better Call CLAUSE: A Discrepancy Benchmark for Auditing LLMs Legal Reasoning Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00340)
*Manan Roy Choudhury,Adithya Chandramouli,Mannan Anand,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLAUSE, a benchmark to test LLMs on detecting subtle flaws in legal contracts, revealing weaknesses in their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmarks for assessing LLM reliability in handling nuanced legal reasoning and adversarial flaws in contracts.

Method: Created CLAUSE benchmark with over 7500 perturbed contracts from datasets like CUAD and ContractNLI, using a persona-driven pipeline for anomaly generation validated by a RAG system.

Result: Evaluated leading LLMs with CLAUSE, revealing their inability to detect certain errors and weaknesses in legal justification.

Conclusion: Highlights reasoning failures in legal AI and proposes a pathway to improve their capabilities in complex legal contexts.

Abstract: The rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into high-stakes legal
work has exposed a critical gap: no benchmark exists to systematically
stress-test their reliability against the nuanced, adversarial, and often
subtle flaws present in real-world contracts. To address this, we introduce
CLAUSE, a first-of-its-kind benchmark designed to evaluate the fragility of an
LLM's legal reasoning. We study the capabilities of LLMs to detect and reason
about fine-grained discrepancies by producing over 7500 real-world perturbed
contracts from foundational datasets like CUAD and ContractNLI. Our novel,
persona-driven pipeline generates 10 distinct anomaly categories, which are
then validated against official statutes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system to ensure legal fidelity. We use CLAUSE to evaluate leading LLMs'
ability to detect embedded legal flaws and explain their significance. Our
analysis shows a key weakness: these models often miss subtle errors and
struggle even more to justify them legally. Our work outlines a path to
identify and correct such reasoning failures in legal AI.

### [11] [Diverse Human Value Alignment for Large Language Models via Ethical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00379)
*Jiahao Wang,Songkai Xue,Jinghui Li,Xiaozhen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses aligning LLMs with diverse human values using a five-step structured ethical reasoning framework, demonstrating improved performance in cultural and regional understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the superficial alignment of LLMs with human values, and addressing the challenge of understanding diverse and context-dependent ethical considerations globally.

Method: The paper proposes a five-step framework for ethical reasoning, including contextual fact gathering, identifying social norms, generating options, conducting ethical impact analysis, and reflecting. This can be implemented via prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed framework shows significant improvements in aligning LLMs with diverse human values, particularly in regional and cultural understanding, as evidenced by evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: The study points toward a structured methodology for LLMs to achieve nuanced alignment with multifaceted human values, advancing global AI ethics through interdisciplinary efforts.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with the diverse and
evolving human values across different regions and cultures remains a critical
challenge in AI ethics. Current alignment approaches often yield superficial
conformity rather than genuine ethical understanding, failing to address the
complex, context-dependent nature of human values. In this paper, we propose a
novel ethical reasoning paradigm for LLMs inspired by well-established ethical
decision-making models, aiming at enhancing diverse human value alignment
through deliberative ethical reasoning. Our framework consists of a structured
five-step process, including contextual fact gathering, hierarchical social
norm identification, option generation, multiple-lens ethical impact analysis,
and reflection. This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an
interpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand
regional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be
implemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods.
We perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for
regional value alignment. Experimental results demonstrate our framework
significantly improves LLM alignment with diverse human values compared to
baseline methods, enabling more accurate social norm identification and more
culturally appropriate reasoning. Our work provides a concrete pathway toward
developing LLMs that align more effectively with the multifaceted values of
global societies through interdisciplinary research.

### [12] [Efficiency vs. Alignment: Investigating Safety and Fairness Risks in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00382)
*Mina Taraghi,Yann Pequignot,Amin Nikanjam,Mohamed Amine Merzouk,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines the safety and fairness trade-offs of different fine-tuning techniques on Large Language Models (LLMs), recommending adapter-based approaches for safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how fine-tuning techniques impact safety and fairness in Large Language Models, addressing the reported issues of performance degradation on these dimensions.

Method: Four Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods (LoRA, IA3, Prompt-Tuning, P-Tuning) were applied to four instruction-tuned LLM families, evaluating 235 variants across safety and fairness metrics.

Result: Adapter-based methods (LoRA, IA3) improved safety and retained fairness, while prompt-based methods reduced safety and exacerbated fairness issues. Base model type influenced outcomes significantly.

Conclusion: Safety and fairness trade-offs exist across fine-tuning methods, with adapter-based approaches preferred for aligned base models. Comprehensive audits are necessary for safety-critical deployments.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly adopting and adapting Large Language Models
(LLMs) hosted on public repositories such as HuggingFace. Although these
adaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent
evidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness.
Since different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these
critical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their
trade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,
IA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model
families (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235
fine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and
nine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based
approaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least
disruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In
contrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce
safety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and
increased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:
LLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest
safety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation
layer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not
necessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single
configuration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an
inherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical
guideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base
model, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both
safety and fairness.

### [13] [A Multimodal Framework for Depression Detection during Covid-19 via Harvesting Social Media: A Novel Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00424)
*Ashutosh Anshul,Gumpili Sai Pranav,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using social media data to detect depression during the Covid-19 pandemic by analyzing textual, user-specific, and visual features using a multimodal approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health cases, such as depression, increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, but effective detection methods using social media data have been underexplored.

Method: The authors introduce a multimodal framework combining text, user-specific data, and images. They employ extrinsic features from URLs in tweets, textual analysis of images, and a Deep Learning model called Visual Neural Network (VNN) for image embeddings.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches by 2%-8% on a benchmark dataset and showed promising results on a curated Covid-19 dataset.

Conclusion: The paper verifies the practicality of multimodal analysis to detect depression, offers new datasets and analysis tools, and provides insights into mental health during the pandemic.

Abstract: The recent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has become a pandemic and has
affected the entire globe. During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in
cases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.
Depression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it
difficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and
unwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use
online social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,
social media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be
utilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing
approaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of
social media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that
combines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among
social media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,
we propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets
and (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets. We also
extract five sets of features belonging to different modalities to describe a
user. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Learning model, the Visual Neural
Network (VNN), to generate embeddings of user-posted images, which are used to
create the visual feature vector for prediction. We contribute a curated
Covid-19 dataset of depressed and non-depressed users for research purposes and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in detecting depression during the
Covid-19 outbreak. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods over
a benchmark dataset by 2%-8% and produces promising results on the Covid-19
dataset. Our analysis highlights the impact of each modality and provides
valuable insights into users' mental and emotional states.

Motivation: To address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling large-scale graphs and enable better reasoning and adaptability.

Method: GraphChain framework introduces Progressive Graph Distillation for optimized tool sequences and Structure-aware Test-Time Adaptation for adaptive tool selection tailored to graph structures.

Result: GraphChain significantly surpasses previous methods in graph analysis by making LLMs scalable and adaptable.

Conclusion: This framework enhances LLM graph analysis, enabling efficient and scalable performance through novel reinforcement learning and adaptive methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations when applied to
large-scale graphs, struggling with context constraints and inflexible
reasoning. We present GraphChain, a framework that enables LLMs to analyze
complex graphs through dynamic sequences of specialized tools, mimicking human
exploratory intelligence. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1)
Progressive Graph Distillation, a reinforcement learning mechanism that
generates optimized tool sequences balancing task relevance with information
compression, and (2) Structure-aware Test-Time Adaptation, which efficiently
tailors tool selection strategies to diverse graph topologies using spectral
properties and lightweight adapters without costly retraining. Experiments show
GraphChain significantly outperforms prior methods, enabling scalable and
adaptive LLM-driven graph analysis.

Result: Experiments show enhanced balance between safety and effectiveness in MLLMs across diverse datasets, with performance preserved.

Conclusion: Magic Image offers a practical and deployable solution for addressing safety challenges in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications but face dual
challenges: generating harmful content under jailbreak attacks and over-refusal
of benign queries due to rigid safety mechanisms. These issues are further
complicated by the need to accommodate different value systems and precisely
align with given safety preferences. Moreover, traditional methods like SFT and
RLHF lack this capability due to their costly parameter tuning requirements and
inability to support multiple value systems within a single model. These
problems are more obvious in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
especially in terms of heightened over-refusal in cross-modal tasks and new
security risks arising from expanded attack surfaces. We propose Magic Image,
an optimization-driven visual prompt framework that enhances security while
reducing over-refusal. By optimizing image prompts using harmful/benign
samples, our method enables a single model to adapt to different value systems
and better align with given safety preferences without parameter updates.
Experiments demonstrate improved safety-effectiveness balance across diverse
datasets while preserving model performance, offering a practical solution for
deployable MLLM safety alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To devise an efficient method to generate Binary Magic Squares, ensuring theoretical correctness, extending it to non-square cases, and making it practical for public use.

Method: Utilized a simple algorithm to generate Binary Magic Squares, validated through induction, and extended it for non-square cases. Python implementations, including a GPU-accelerated version, were created for practical use.

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm for generating Binary Magic Squares (BMS),
i.e., square binary matrices where the sum of all rows and all columns are
equal. We show by induction that our algorithm always returns valid BMS with
optimal theoretical complexity. We then extend our study to non-square Binary
Magic Squares, formalize conditions on the sum of rows and columns for these
BMS to exist, and show that a slight variant of our first algorithm can
generate provably generate them. Finally, we publicly release two
implementations of our algorithm as Python packages, including one that can
generate several BMS in parallel using GPU acceleration.

### [17] [Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551)
*Qiang Li,Ningjing Zeng,Lina Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single-agent reinforcement learning model for regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC), leveraging probe vehicle data for scalability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic signal control studies primarily use multi-agent frameworks, but these face scalability challenges. Traffic signal management requires centralized control due to its dependency on comprehensive monitoring and coordination.

Method: A single-agent RL-based ATSC model was designed with probe vehicle technology. State and reward functions were based on queue length, and actions were determined to regulate congestion dynamics. The queue length definition was adjusted for reliable estimation using probe vehicle travel time data.

Result: The proposed method was tested using SUMO simulations, showing effective reduction of large-scale regional congestion via coordinated multi-intersection control.

Conclusion: The single-agent RL approach, utilizing probe vehicle data, proves to be an effective and scalable solution for regional traffic signal control in urban environments.

Abstract: Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the
challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved
promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts
multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks
presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC)
problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on
centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic
conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all
intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model
compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design
include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning
and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on
queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length
definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions
but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows
for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With
probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the
proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was
comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale
regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.

*Shengqi Xu,Xinpeng Zhou,Yabo Zhang,Ming Liu,Tao Liang,Tianyu Zhang,Yalong Bai,Zuxuan Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to assess personalized image preferences using reference images, tackling challenges of scarce and complex user data by introducing a common preference profile and reasoning-based assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with personalized image preference assessment due to scarce data and diverse individual tastes. This paper aims to overcome such challenges.

Method: A predict-then-assess paradigm is introduced: a model predicts a user's preference profile, then provides interpretable assessments based on the profile. It uses a large-scale annotated dataset, cold-start fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and similarity-aware prediction rewards.

Result: Experiments show the method's superior performance in assessing personalized image preferences compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages user data to handle complex personalized preference assessment, improving interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: Personalized image preference assessment aims to evaluate an individual
user's image preferences by relying only on a small set of reference images as
prior information. Existing methods mainly focus on general preference
assessment, training models with large-scale data to tackle well-defined tasks
such as text-image alignment. However, these approaches struggle to handle
personalized preference because user-specific data are scarce and not easily
scalable, and individual tastes are often diverse and complex. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a common preference profile that serves as a
bridge across users, allowing large-scale user data to be leveraged for
training profile prediction and capturing complex personalized preferences.
Building on this idea, we propose a reasoning-based personalized image
preference assessment framework that follows a \textit{predict-then-assess}
paradigm: it first predicts a user's preference profile from reference images,
and then provides interpretable, multi-dimensional scores and assessments of
candidate images based on the predicted profile. To support this, we first
construct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment
dataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality
CoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning.
Next, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised
fine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities,
followed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more
reasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose
a similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the
user's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments
exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method.

### [19] [DTS: Enhancing Large Reasoning Models via Decoding Tree Sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00640)
*Zicheng Xu,Guanchu Wang,Yu-Neng Chuang,Guangyao Zheng,Alexander S. Szalay,Zirui Liu,Vladimir Braverman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the overthinking issue in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that leads to unnecessarily long reasoning processes by introducing DTS, a decoding framework that identifies shorter and more accurate reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce inference cost and improve accuracy of LRMs suffering from overthinking, which leads to unnecessarily long and error-prone reasoning chains.

Method: DTS, a model-agnostic decoding framework, was introduced. DTS sketches reasoning space by branching selectively at high-entropy tokens and uses early stopping to identify the shortest correct reasoning paths without requiring extra training.

Result: Experiments showed DTS improved accuracy by up to 8%, reduced reasoning length by 23%, and lowered repetition rates by 12% on AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets.

Conclusion: DTS offers a scalable, efficient solution for improving the reasoning performance and inference cost of LRMs, achieving better reasoning accuracy and efficiency without additional training requirements.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they often suffer from overthinking, producing excessively
long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces that increase inference cost and may degrade
accuracy. Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning
length and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short
reasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones
accumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be
found ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space. However, the
tree-structured reasoning space grows exponentially with sequence length,
rendering exhaustive exploration infeasible. To address this, we propose DTS, a
model-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by
selectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to
select the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the
optimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring
additional training or supervision. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025
datasets with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 1.5B show that DTS improves
accuracy by up to 8%, reduces average reasoning length by 23%, and decreases
repetition frequency by 12%, demonstrating DTS's ability for scalable and
efficient LRM reasoning.

### [20] [Leveraging Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Fine-Tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for Automated Telecom Network Troubleshooting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00651)
*Chenhua Shi,Bhavika Jalli,Gregor Macdonald,John Zou,Wanlu Lei,Mridul Jain,Joji Philip*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Agent System (MAS) using Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized tools for automated troubleshooting in telecom networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing scale and complexity of telecom networks make management and troubleshooting difficult, requiring a shift from traditional SME-dependent approaches to automated solutions.

Method: The study proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that incorporates AI/ML fault detection, specialized agents (orchestrator, planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer), and fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for troubleshooting and creating remediation plans.

Result: The framework accelerates and enhances troubleshooting automation in both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.

Conclusion: The proposed MAS demonstrates the potential of domain-specific automated systems to reduce reliance on SMEs and improve the efficiency and speed of troubleshooting telecom networks.

Abstract: Telecom networks are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, making
effective management, operation, and optimization increasingly challenging.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to many telecom tasks,
existing models are often narrow in scope, require large amounts of labeled
data, and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
Consequently, network troubleshooting continues to rely heavily on Subject
Matter Experts (SMEs) to manually correlate various data sources to identify
root causes and corrective actions. To address these limitations, we propose a
Multi-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language
Models (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated
network troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the
framework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution
planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues
and recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame. A key component
of this system is the solution planner, which generates appropriate remediation
plans based on internal documentation. To enable this, we fine-tuned a Small
Language Model (SLM) on proprietary troubleshooting documents to produce
domain-grounded solution plans. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework significantly accelerates troubleshooting automation across
both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.

### [21] [Lifted Successor Generation in Numeric Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00673)
*Dominik Drexler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends lifted successor generation methods to include numeric preconditions for planning tasks, addressing scalability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the exponential growth in task representation size for numeric planning problems grounded into first-order-like languages.

Method: The method incorporates numeric preconditions into a lifted successor generator, using substitution consistency graphs and maximum cliques to determine ground actions. Applicability checks are used to ensure correctness, even under certain conditions.

Result: The proposed approach is exact under specific conditions. Testing across benchmark domains shows a rare occurrence of inapplicable actions, highlighting its practicality.

Conclusion: This work leads to an advanced framework for lifted planning with numeric preconditions, enabling further research on sophisticated planning systems.

Abstract: Most planners ground numeric planning tasks, given in a first-order-like
language, into a ground task representation. However, this can lead to an
exponential blowup in task representation size, which occurs in practice for
hard-to-ground tasks. We extend a state-of-the-art lifted successor generator
for classical planning to support numeric precondition applicability. The
method enumerates maximum cliques in a substitution consistency graph. Each
maximum clique represents a substitution for the variables of the action
schema, yielding a ground action. We augment this graph with numeric action
preconditions and prove the successor generator is exact under formally
specified conditions. When the conditions fail, our generator may list
inapplicable ground actions; a final applicability check filters these without
affecting completeness. However, this cannot happen in 23 of 25 benchmark
domains, and it occurs only in 1 domain. To the authors' knowledge, no other
lifted successor generator supports numeric action preconditions. This enables
future research on lifted planning for a very rich planning fragment.

### [22] [Ariadne: A Controllable Framework for Probing and Extending VLM Reasoning Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00710)
*Minghe Shen,Zhuo Zhi,Chonghan Liu,Shuo Xing,Zhengzhong Tu,Che Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new post-training framework to improve Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visual-centric spatial tasks using synthetic mazes and Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to evaluate whether RL post-training can extend the inherent capability boundary of VLMs, particularly for visual-centric spatial tasks, where these models typically fail.

Method: It uses a synthetic maze environment with controlled difficulty to train VLMs with RLVR in a difficulty-aware curriculum, aiming to improve visual-spatial reasoning.

Result: Post-training, the VLM achieved over 50% accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks where the base model scored 0%, and demonstrated OOD generalization improvements in real-world tasks (e.g., 16% on MapBench and 24% on ReasonMap).

Conclusion: The findings indicate that RLVR post-training can expand the capability boundary of VLMs, particularly for spatial reasoning, although the study is confined to post-training limitations, inspiring future work on alignment strategies.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) post-trained with Reinforcement Learning
(RL) show impressive general reasoning, their evaluation is often confined to
language-dominant tasks (e.g., math). This raises a critical question: can RL
post-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM,
particularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To
investigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizing synthetic mazes
for multi-step spatial reasoning where task difficulty (e.g., path length,
turns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to
train VLMs using Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) in a
difficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVR training, the VLM achieves
over 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%,
demonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability
boundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze
samples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% on
MapBench (e.g., museum navigation) and 24% on ReasonMap (subway transfer
tasks). These results confirm that our method not only broadens the model's
fundamental limits but also enhances its generalization to real-world spatial
reasoning. We acknowledge our study is limited to the post-training phase,
given the opaqueness of pre-training data, and hope our research motivates
further work on specialized, capability-extending alignment.

### [23] [A CPU-Centric Perspective on Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00739)
*Ritik Raj,Hong Wang,Tushar Krishna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the system bottlenecks in agentic AI from a CPU-centric perspective and proposes optimizations to enhance performance, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and address the overlooked impact of CPUs on the performance bottlenecks in agentic AI systems, which are becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and problem-solving tasks.

Method: The authors systematically characterize agentic AI systems based on decision-making, inference path dynamics, and repetitiveness. They profile five representative AI workloads to analyze latency, throughput, and energy usage metrics, emphasizing CPU contributions. Further, they propose optimizations like CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching (CGAM) and Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS).

Result: The study reveals critical CPU-related bottlenecks, including CPUs accounting for up to 90.6% latency in tool processing and up to 44% dynamic energy consumption. Implementing optimizations led to significant performance improvements, achieving up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup for homogeneous and heterogeneous workloads, respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems encounter significant CPU-induced performance bottlenecks, which can be mitigated through targeted optimizations like CGAM and MAWS, resulting in notable improvements in efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with
external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database,
and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles
into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps,
and adapt on the fly.
  This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks
introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric
perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of
orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and
repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level
performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five
representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow,
Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and
demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We
observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total
latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors -
coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main
memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to
44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling
insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching
(CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and
heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to
improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve
up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing
benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how increasing sampled reasoning paths in self-consistency affects performance in modern large language models, finding that gains eventually taper off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and verify prior claims about self-consistency's effectiveness in reasoning tasks using newer LLMs.

Method: The study compared varied sampled reasoning paths and single chain-of-thought baselines across Gemini 2.5 models applied to HotpotQA and Math-500 datasets.

Result: Larger models showed stable improvement curves, but performance gains diminished after moderate sampling due to path overlap.

Conclusion: Self-consistency is beneficial, but high-sample configurations are computationally costly and offer limited additional improvement.

Abstract: This study examines the trade-offs of increasing sampled reasoning paths in
self-consistency for modern large language models (LLMs). Earlier research with
older models showed that combining multiple reasoning chains improves results
before reaching a plateau. Using Gemini 2.5 models on HotpotQA and Math-500, we
revisit those claims under current model conditions. Each configuration pooled
outputs from varying sampled reasoning paths and compared them to a single
chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline. Larger models exhibited a more stable and
consistent improvement curve. The results confirm that performance gains taper
off after moderate sampling, aligning with past findings. This plateau suggests
diminishing returns driven by overlap among reasoning paths. Self-consistency
remains useful, but high-sample configurations offer little benefit relative to
their computational cost.

### [25] [Active Thinking Model: A Goal-Directed Self-Improving Framework for Real-World Adaptive Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00758)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Active Thinking Model (ATM), an adaptive AI framework for dynamic and uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems are limited by predefined objectives and static data, which hinder their adaptability in dynamic, changing environments.

Method: ATM integrates goal reasoning, dynamic task generation, and self-reflective learning into a continuous improvement loop.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves ATM's capability to evolve autonomously from suboptimal to optimal behavior with bounded tracking regret.

Conclusion: ATM establishes itself as an innovative model capable of learning, adapting, and improving in uncertain scenarios without external supervision.

Abstract: Real-world artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly required to
operate autonomously in dynamic, uncertain, and continuously changing
environments. However, most existing AI models rely on predefined objectives,
static training data, and externally supplied feedback, which restrict their
ability to adapt, reflect, and improve independently. In this paper, we propose
the Active Thinking Model (ATM)- a unified cognitive framework that integrates
goal reasoning, dynamic task generation, and self-reflective learning into an
adaptive architecture. Unlike conventional systems that passively execute fixed
procedures, ATM actively evaluates its performance through logical reasoning
and environmental indicators, reuses effective methods to solve new problems,
and generates novel strategies for unseen situations via a continuous
self-improvement loop. A mathematically grounded theoretical analysis
demonstrates that ATM can autonomously evolve from suboptimal to optimal
behavior without external supervision and maintain bounded tracking regret
under changing environmental conditions.

*Wanda Hou,Leon Zhou,Hong-Ye Hu,Yi-Zhuang You,Xiao-Liang Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies how large language models handle repetitive deterministic tasks, finding a sharp drop-off in sequence accuracy as output length increases and proposing a statistical physics-inspired explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well large language models perform on tasks requiring repetitive deterministic operations and understand their limitations in sequence accuracy over extended lengths.

Method: Experiments were conducted on leading large language models with deterministic tasks like letter replacement, integer addition, and quantum operator multiplication. A physics-inspired model was proposed to explain observed accuracy failures and the associated factors.

Result: Findings reveal a sharp double exponential decline in sequence accuracy beyond a certain output length. The physics-inspired model successfully explains these failures and provides a framework to quantify error rates and accumulation factors.

Conclusion: Large language models exhibit a significant accuracy cliff due to failure in consistently executing operations independently over long sequences. The study introduces a framework to understand the intrinsic limitations in their deterministic accuracy.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive
deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales
with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n
times. Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule,
integer addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum
mechanics. If the model performs the task through a simple repetition
algorithm, the success rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In
contrast, our experiments on leading large language models reveal a sharp
double exponential drop beyond a characteristic length scale, forming an
accuracy cliff that marks the transition from reliable to unstable generation.
This indicates that the models fail to execute each operation independently. To
explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical physics inspired model that
captures the competition between external conditioning from the prompt and
internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively
reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between
attention induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to
empirical results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters
that characterize the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for
each model task pair, offering a principled framework for understanding the
limits of deterministic accuracy in large language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks count-based models, a sequential transformer, and mixture-of-agents pipelines for EHR prediction. Results show split wins among approaches, emphasizing the simplicity and value of count-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare methodologies for clinical prediction using structured EHR data, especially benchmarking traditional count-based models against modern LLM pipelines.

Method: Three methodologies were assessed using the EHRSHOT dataset: count-based models (LightGBM and TabPFN), a pretrained sequential transformer (CLMBR), and a mixture-of-agents pipeline translating tabular histories to summaries for text classification.

Result: For eight outcomes on the EHRSHOT dataset, both count-based models and mixture-of-agents methods showed comparable performance, each winning in different tasks.

Conclusion: Despite advancements in LLM approaches, count-based models remain efficient, interpretable, and competitive candidates for structured EHR benchmarking.

Abstract: Structured electronic health records (EHR) are essential for clinical
prediction. While count-based learners continue to perform strongly on such
data, no benchmarking has directly compared them against more recent
mixture-of-agents LLM pipelines, which have been reported to outperform single
LLMs in various NLP tasks. In this study, we evaluated three categories of
methodologies for EHR prediction using the EHRSHOT dataset: count-based models
built from ontology roll-ups with two time bins, based on LightGBM and the
tabular foundation model TabPFN; a pretrained sequential transformer (CLMBR);
and a mixture-of-agents pipeline that converts tabular histories to
natural-language summaries followed by a text classifier. We assessed eight
outcomes using the EHRSHOT dataset. Across the eight evaluation tasks,
head-to-head wins were largely split between the count-based and the
mixture-of-agents methods. Given their simplicity and interpretability,
count-based models remain a strong candidate for structured EHR benchmarking.

*Bowen Fang,Ruijian Zha,Xuan Di*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new application of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for noisy, real-world forecasting in public transit incident duration prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised fine-tuning struggles with tasks involving noisy continuous labels and lacks reliable expert demonstrations, making it difficult to address challenges in real-world public transit forecasting.

Method: The authors leverage RLVR with a novel tolerance-based shaped reward function, assigning partial credit within error margins to adapt RLVR for continuous forecasting.

Result: Instruction-tuned general-purpose LLMs outperformed specialized math-reasoning models, achieving a 35% relative improvement in 5-minute accuracy over the strongest baseline using shaped rewards.

Conclusion: RLVR can address noisy, real-world forecasting challenges, provided the verifier design accounts for the continuous nature of the problem.

Abstract: Predicting public transit incident duration from unstructured text alerts is
a critical but challenging task. Addressing the domain sparsity of transit
operations with standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is difficult, as the task
involves noisy, continuous labels and lacks reliable expert demonstrations for
reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) excels
at tasks with binary correctness, like mathematics, its applicability to noisy,
continuous forecasting is an open question. This work, to our knowledge, is the
first to bridge the gap between RLVR LLM training with the critical, real-world
forecasting challenges in public transit operations. We adapt RLVR to this task
by introducing a tolerance-based, shaped reward function that grants partial
credit within a continuous error margin, rather than demanding a single correct
answer. We systematically evaluate this framework on a curated dataset of NYC
MTA service alerts. Our findings show that general-purpose, instruction-tuned
LLMs significantly outperform specialized math-reasoning models, which struggle
with the ambiguous, real-world text. We empirically demonstrate that the binary
reward is unstable and degrades performance, whereas our shaped reward design
is critical and allows our model to dominate on the most challenging metrics.
While classical regressors are superior at minimizing overall MAE or MSE, our
RLVR approach achieved a 35\% relative improvement in 5-minute accuracy (Acc@5)
over the strongest baseline. This demonstrates that RLVR can be successfully
adapted to real-world, noisy forecasting, but requires a verifier design that
reflects the continuous nature of the problem.

*Kyung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores self-awareness in advanced language models (LLMs) using the AI Self-Awareness Index, revealing that self-awareness emerges as a capability in advanced models and influences their strategic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand whether advanced large language models (LLMs) exhibit self-awareness as an emergent behavior and how this can be measured effectively.

Method: The authors introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), utilizing a game-theoretic framework based on the "Guess 2/3 of Average" game to test 28 language models across 4,200 trials under different opponent scenarios.

Result: The study finds that self-awareness is evident in 75% of advanced models, with these models showing differentiation based on opponent type. They also consistently rate themselves as more rational compared to humans and other AIs, with systematic patterns of self-preferencing.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that self-awareness is an emergent capability in advanced LLMs, which impacts their reasoning and perception of human capabilities. This has significant implications for AI alignment and collaboration between humans and AI.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, do they develop
self-awareness as an emergent behavior? And if so, can we measure it? We
introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for
measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess
2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across
4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against
other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize
self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on
opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The
majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness,
while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware
models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with
self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs >
Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These
findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs,
and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational
than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration,
and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.

*Tianming Liu,Jirong Yang,Yafeng Yin,Manzi Li,Linghao Wang,Zheng Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-agent framework using LLM agents for modeling human travelers' learning and adaptation from transportation system interactions, demonstrating strong simulation accuracy and behavioral alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges involve modeling complex human cognition and decision-making in travel behavior to improve transportation system assessment and planning.

Method: The framework includes LLM traveler agents with memory and persona systems, paired with an LLM calibration agent to ensure realistic travel behavior simulations via alignment mechanisms.

Result: The dual-agent framework outperformed existing LLM-based methods in simulation accuracy and behavioral alignment using real-world travel data, capturing adaptive learning processes over time.

Conclusion: The approach enhances transportation simulations and policy analysis by creating adaptive, realistic simulations of how travelers learn and adjust their behavior.

Abstract: Effective modeling of how human travelers learn and adjust their travel
behavior from interacting with transportation systems is critical for system
assessment and planning. However, this task is also difficult due to the
complex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent
research has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task.
Building on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables
continuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on
learning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach
involves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a
learnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure
behavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the
reasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these
traveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track
and align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce
realistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day
route choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and
aggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method
moves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying
learning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.
Overall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and
behaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation
that can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis.

*Hui-Lee Ooi,Nicholas Mitsakakis,Margerie Huet Dastarac,Roger Zemek,Amy C. Plint,Jeff Gilchrist,Khaled El Emam,Dhenuka Radhakrishnan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development of machine learning models to predict severe asthma exacerbations in children using electronic medical record data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent recurrent asthma exacerbations in children by identifying individuals at risk through machine learning methods, leveraging EMR data, environmental exposure, and social determinants of health.

Method: The researchers developed machine learning models (boosted trees and large language models) based on retrospective EMR data and external factors. They trained models on pre-COVID data and validated them with post-COVID data, comparing performance metrics like AUC and F1 scores.

Result: The best-performing model, LGBM, achieved an AUC of 0.712 and an F1 score of 0.51, improving over current decision rules. Key predictive features included prior asthma ED visits, medical complexity, Canadian triage scale, and associated health variables.

Conclusion: ML models, particularly LGBM, showed potential for better identifying children at risk for severe asthma exacerbations compared to current methods, paving the way for more targeted interventions.

Abstract: Recurrent exacerbations remain a common yet preventable outcome for many
children with asthma. Machine learning (ML) algorithms using electronic medical
records (EMR) could allow accurate identification of children at risk for
exacerbations and facilitate referral for preventative comprehensive care to
avoid this morbidity. We developed ML algorithms to predict repeat severe
exacerbations (i.e. asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits or future
hospital admissions) for children with a prior asthma ED visit at a tertiary
care children's hospital.
  Retrospective pre-COVID19 (Feb 2017 - Feb 2019, N=2716) Epic EMR data from
the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) linked with environmental
pollutant exposure and neighbourhood marginalization information was used to
train various ML models. We used boosted trees (LGBM, XGB) and 3 open-source
large language model (LLM) approaches (DistilGPT2, Llama 3.2 1B and
Llama-8b-UltraMedical). Models were tuned and calibrated then validated in a
second retrospective post-COVID19 dataset (Jul 2022 - Apr 2023, N=1237) from
CHEO. Models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) and F1 scores,
with SHAP values used to determine the most predictive features.
  The LGBM ML model performed best with the most predictive features in the
final AIRE-KIDS_ED model including prior asthma ED visit, the Canadian triage
acuity scale, medical complexity, food allergy, prior ED visits for non-asthma
respiratory diagnoses, and age for an AUC of 0.712, and F1 score of 0.51. This
is a nontrivial improvement over the current decision rule which has F1=0.334.
While the most predictive features in the AIRE-KIDS_HOSP model included medical
complexity, prior asthma ED visit, average wait time in the ED, the pediatric
respiratory assessment measure score at triage and food allergy.

*Tiberiu Musat,Tiago Pimentel,Lorenzo Noci,Alessandro Stolfo,Mrinmaya Sachan,Thomas Hofmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how induction heads in transformers emerge and function, providing theoretical and empirical evidence about their structure and training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind in-context learning enabled by transformers, particularly focusing on induction heads.

Method: The authors use a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation. They introduce a modified transformer architecture and study a minimal in-context learning task to derive insights.

Result: They discover a simple structure in the weight matrices of induction heads and show that training dynamics are constrained to a 19-dimensional subspace, with three dimensions crucial for induction head emergence. They also establish that the emergence is quadratically dependent on the input context length.

Conclusion: Induction heads, crucial for in-context learning in transformers, have interpretable dynamics and structure. Their emergence can be fully understood within a constrained subspace, offering insights into transformer behavior.

Abstract: Transformers have become the dominant architecture for natural language
processing. Part of their success is owed to a remarkable capability known as
in-context learning (ICL): they can acquire and apply novel associations solely
from their input context, without any updates to their weights. In this work,
we study the emergence of induction heads, a previously identified mechanism in
two-layer transformers that is particularly important for in-context learning.
We uncover a relatively simple and interpretable structure of the weight
matrices implementing the induction head. We theoretically explain the origin
of this structure using a minimal ICL task formulation and a modified
transformer architecture. We give a formal proof that the training dynamics
remain constrained to a 19-dimensional subspace of the parameter space.
Empirically, we validate this constraint while observing that only 3 dimensions
account for the emergence of an induction head. By further studying the
training dynamics inside this 3-dimensional subspace, we find that the time
until the emergence of an induction head follows a tight asymptotic bound that
is quadratic in the input context length.

### [33] [Knowledge Elicitation with Large Language Models for Interpretable Cancer Stage Identification from Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01052)
*Yeawon Lee,Christopher C. Yang,Chia-Hsuan Chang,Grace Lu-Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study focuses on using large language models (LLMs) with unique methods for automated cancer staging from unstructured pathology reports, specifically targeting the TNM system. Two approaches, KEwLTM and KEwRAG, improve interpretability and scalability without needing annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cancer staging is vital for prognosis and treatment planning, but extracting staging information from pathology reports is challenging due to their unstructured nature and the dependency on annotated datasets in existing NLP/ML strategies.

Method: The paper introduces two methods: KEwLTM, which uses iterative prompting and the LLM's memory to derive rules from reports; and KEwRAG, which utilizes retrieval-augmented strategy by pre-extracting rules from guidelines. Both rely on LLMs applying broad pre-learned knowledge.

Result: KEwLTM excelled when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference was effective, while KEwRAG had better results when ZSCOT inference struggled. Evaluation was conducted with breast cancer reports from TCGA dataset, with both methods providing interpretable rule-based outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are promising scalable solutions for automated cancer staging, especially in clinical settings with limited annotated data, offering high performance and transparency.

Abstract: Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet
extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a
persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine
learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting
their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge
Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large
language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer
staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses
an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from
unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The
second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG),
employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant
guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and
avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply
broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer
pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in
identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches
on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG
when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG
achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both
methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules
explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation
methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging
with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited
annotated data.

### [34] [Efficient Test-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01059)
*Hailong Yin,Bin Zhu,Jingjing Chen,Chong-Wah Ngo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed ET2RAG framework improves LLM performance with efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation through relevant document retrieval and response optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inaccuracies in LLM responses due to reliance on parametric knowledge and optimize retrieval-augmented methods for high performance and efficiency.

Method: ET2RAG employs retrieval of relevant documents, generates candidate responses by managing length, computes similarity, and applies majority voting to select the final response.

Result: ET2RAG significantly improves performance in open-domain question answering, recipe generation, and image captioning tasks.

Conclusion: ET2RAG provides an efficient, training-free way to improve LLM output quality without compromising computational costs, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities,
their reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to inaccuracies. Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge,
but these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to
inaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect
answers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods,
and their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To
address these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented
Generation Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while
maintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that
first retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to
efficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length.
Then we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority
voting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In
particular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the
key information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively
perform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus,
we can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing
the response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting.
Experimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance
across three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation
and image captioning.

*Shuaidong Pan,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent system for solving complex tasks efficiently using language-driven task decomposition and dynamic collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-agent systems in handling complex tasks effectively.

Method: The method involves converting natural language task descriptions into semantic representations, modular decomposition of tasks, dynamic scheduling, routing mechanisms, and a constraint parsing mechanism.

Result: Experimental results indicate better performance, robustness, and balanced task execution compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: This study validates multi-agent architectures driven by language for enhanced task decomposition and collaboration in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of a single agent in task decomposition
and collaboration during complex task execution, and proposes a multi-agent
architecture for modular task decomposition and dynamic collaboration based on
large language models. The method first converts natural language task
descriptions into unified semantic representations through a large language
model. On this basis, a modular decomposition mechanism is introduced to break
down the overall goal into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks. Then, dynamic
scheduling and routing mechanisms enable reasonable division of labor and
realtime collaboration among agents, allowing the system to adjust strategies
continuously according to environmental feedback, thus maintaining efficiency
and stability in complex tasks. Furthermore, a constraint parsing and global
consistency mechanism is designed to ensure coherent connections between
sub-tasks and balanced workload, preventing performance degradation caused by
redundant communication or uneven resource allocation. The experiments validate
the architecture across multiple dimensions, including task success rate,
decomposition efficiency, sub-task coverage, and collaboration balance. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both
overall performance and robustness, achieving a better balance between task
complexity and communication overhead. In conclusion, this study demonstrates
the effectiveness and feasibility of language-driven task decomposition and
dynamic collaboration in multi-agent systems, providing a systematic solution
for task execution in complex environments.

### [36] [DART: Difficulty-Adaptive Reasoning Truncation for Efficient Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01170)
*Ruofan Zhang,Bin Xia,Zhen Cheng,Cairen Jian,Minglun Yang,Ngai Wong,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the DART framework to optimize the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by truncating unnecessary computation based on problem difficulty, resulting in efficient and adaptive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle inefficiencies in current chain-of-thought reasoning methods for LLMs, which generate long explanations indiscriminately, while reinforcement learning approaches remain unstable and overly reliant on rewards.

Method: DART employs supervised learning to create a difficulty-adaptive reasoning truncation framework. It uses distilled concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolates varying reasoning styles, and curates effective training data that balances correctness and compactness.

Result: The DART framework improves computational efficiency by achieving an 81.2% reduction in reasoning steps and a 5.33x speedup in computational performance. This is achieved while maintaining or improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DART proves to be a stable and general framework for adaptive reasoning, significantly increasing efficiency and performance in LLMs, and represents a step forward in developing adaptive intelligence.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of
large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current
chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate
long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing
reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and
heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised
\textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation
framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By
distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them
into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that
balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''.
Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its
remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a
significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K
dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable
and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of
adaptive intelligence in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting misconceptions in open-ended student responses requiring semantic precision and logical reasoning.

Method: Three-stage framework: retrieval module for narrowing down responses, reasoning module for logical assessment, and reranking module for refined predictions using ensemble fusion.

Result: MiRAGE achieves high Mean Average Precision scores of 0.82/0.92/0.93 at different levels on mathematics datasets, outperforming individual components.

Conclusion: MiRAGE offers a scalable and effective tool for educational assessment by reducing reliance on large language models while improving interpretability and accuracy.

Abstract: Detecting student misconceptions in open-ended responses is a longstanding
challenge, demanding semantic precision and logical reasoning. We propose
MiRAGE - Misconception Detection with Retrieval-Guided Multi-Stage Reasoning
and Ensemble Fusion, a novel framework for automated misconception detection in
mathematics. MiRAGE operates in three stages: (1) a Retrieval module narrows a
large candidate pool to a semantically relevant subset; (2) a Reasoning module
employs chain-of-thought generation to expose logical inconsistencies in
student solutions; and (3) a Reranking module refines predictions by aligning
them with the reasoning. These components are unified through an
ensemble-fusion strategy that enhances robustness and interpretability. On
mathematics datasets, MiRAGE achieves Mean Average Precision scores of
0.82/0.92/0.93 at levels 1/3/5, consistently outperforming individual modules.
By coupling retrieval guidance with multi-stage reasoning, MiRAGE reduces
dependence on large-scale language models while delivering a scalable and
effective solution for educational assessment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuComBack, a benchmark dataset for IR-to-assembly compilation, and proposes a self-evolving prompt optimization for improving LLM capabilities in neural compilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify compiler development for new architectures and explore innovative optimization techniques using LLMs while addressing challenges like benchmark availability and improving performance and reliability of LLM-generated assembly.

Method: The paper introduces NeuComBack as a benchmark for IR-to-assembly compilation, evaluates LLMs to set baselines, and develops a self-evolving prompt optimization method to enhance LLM performance using prior self-debugging insights.

Result: The self-evolving prompt optimization method improved functional correctness from 44% to 64% on x86_64 and from 36% to 58% on aarch64. Additionally, 14 out of 16 correctly generated x86_64 programs surpassed clang-O3 performance.

Conclusion: NeuComBack and the proposed optimization method significantly advance the field of Neural Compilation by addressing key challenges, laying a foundation for future research and application.

Abstract: Compilers, while essential, are notoriously complex systems that demand
prohibitively expensive human expertise to develop and maintain. The recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling new paradigm:
Neural Compilation, which could potentially simplify compiler development for
new architectures and facilitate the discovery of innovative optimization
techniques. However, several critical obstacles impede its practical adoption.
Firstly, a significant lack of dedicated benchmarks and robust evaluation
methodologies hinders objective assessment and tracking of progress in the
field. Secondly, systematically enhancing the reliability and performance of
LLM-generated assembly remains a critical challenge. Addressing these
challenges, this paper introduces NeuComBack, a novel benchmark dataset
specifically designed for IR-to-assembly compilation. Leveraging this dataset,
we first define a foundational Neural Compilation workflow and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of recent frontier LLMs on Neural
Compilation, establishing new performance baselines. We further propose a
self-evolving prompt optimization method that enables LLMs to iteratively
evolve their internal prompt strategies by extracting insights from prior
self-debugging traces, thereby enhancing their neural compilation capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the
functional correctness and the performance of LLM-generated assembly code.
Compared to baseline prompts, the functional correctness rates improved from
44% to 64% on x86_64 and from 36% to 58% on aarch64, respectively. More
significantly, among the 16 correctly generated x86_64 programs using our
method, 14 (87.5%) surpassed clang-O3 performance.

*Chuyue Lou,M. Amine Atoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework for addressing unknown fault types in marine machinery systems, utilizing deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most fault diagnosis methods rely on consistent and known fault types across datasets, which is impractical when encountering unknown or new fault types, limiting industrial applications.

Method: The proposed SOFD framework uses a reliability subset construction process with multi-layer fusion feature representation and a semi-supervised diagnosis model for enhanced accuracy in identifying known and unknown faults.

Result: Experimental analysis on a public maritime dataset confirms the framework's superiority in accurately diagnosing known faults and detecting previously unknown samples.

Conclusion: The SOFD framework effectively extends the applicability of deep learning in open-set fault diagnosis scenarios, addressing challenges in real-world industrial systems.

Abstract: Recently, fault diagnosis methods for marine machinery systems based on deep
learning models have attracted considerable attention in the shipping industry.
Most existing studies assume fault classes are consistent and known between the
training and test datasets, and these methods perform well under controlled
environment. In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types
(i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during
training) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant
challenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge,
this paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework
that enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set
fault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset
construction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation
extracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test
subset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed
into a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for
each class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective
detection of unknown samples. Experimental results on a public maritime
benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
SOFD framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates applying Shapley values for feature attribution in stochastic inference environments, specifically large language models (LLMs), analyzing the reliability and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve explainability in LLM-based decision support systems by evaluating the application of Shapley value-based feature attribution methods, addressing their behavior in stochastic contexts.

Method: The authors explore the implementation of Shapley value principles on LLM-based stochastic decision support systems, testing their reliability and trade-offs.

Result: They identify scenarios where Shapley principles hold or fail under stochastic inference in LLMs, and evaluate trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and principle satisfaction.

Conclusion: Shapley value methods can be applied to stochastic inference environments, but trade-offs exist between speed, accuracy, and adherence to attribution principles, necessitating informed decisions in their implementation for LLMs.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods help make machine learning-based inference
explainable by determining how much one or several features have contributed to
a model's output. A particularly popular attribution method is based on the
Shapley value from cooperative game theory, a measure that guarantees the
satisfaction of several desirable principles, assuming deterministic inference.
We apply the Shapley value to feature attribution in large language model
(LLM)-based decision support systems, where inference is, by design, stochastic
(non-deterministic). We then demonstrate when we can and cannot guarantee
Shapley value principle satisfaction across different implementation variants
applied to LLM-based decision support, and analyze how the stochastic nature of
LLMs affects these guarantees. We also highlight trade-offs between explainable
inference speed, agreement with exact Shapley value attributions, and principle
attainment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniFuser, a multimodal learning framework combining tool images and force signal data for predictive maintenance of milling tools in intelligent manufacturing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unplanned tool failures in manufacturing systems, which lead to production issues, by providing a reliable predictive maintenance solution using multimodal data integration.

Method: OmniFuser combines high-resolution tool images and cutting-force signals, using a fusion mechanism to merge shared and specific features, and applies a recursive refinement pathway for stabilized representations.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show OmniFuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive maintenance tasks, including tool-state classification and multi-step force signal forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed OmniFuser framework offers a robust approach to predictive maintenance, enabling efficient and reliable maintenance service modules for industrial applications.

Abstract: Accurate and timely prediction of tool conditions is critical for intelligent
manufacturing systems, where unplanned tool failures can lead to quality
degradation and production downtime. In modern industrial environments,
predictive maintenance is increasingly implemented as an intelligent service
that integrates sensing, analysis, and decision support across production
processes. To meet the demand for reliable and service-oriented operation, we
present OmniFuser, a multimodal learning framework for predictive maintenance
of milling tools that leverages both visual and sensor data. It performs
parallel feature extraction from high-resolution tool images and cutting-force
signals, capturing complementary spatiotemporal patterns across modalities. To
effectively integrate heterogeneous features, OmniFuser employs a
contamination-free cross-modal fusion mechanism that disentangles shared and
modality-specific components, allowing for efficient cross-modal interaction.
Furthermore, a recursive refinement pathway functions as an anchor mechanism,
consistently retaining residual information to stabilize fusion dynamics. The
learned representations can be encapsulated as reusable maintenance service
modules, supporting both tool-state classification (e.g., Sharp, Used, Dulled)
and multi-step force signal forecasting. Experiments on real-world milling
datasets demonstrate that OmniFuser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, providing a dependable foundation for building intelligent
industrial maintenance services.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Competitive Isolation PSM-DID, a novel causal inference framework for platform-level evaluations in search-based marketplaces, effectively addressing systemic spillover and network interference issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal inference frameworks like PSM-DID face challenges such as selection bias and network interference when applied to platform-level metrics in marketplaces.

Method: The proposed Competitive Isolation PSM-DID integrates propensity score matching with competitive isolation to mitigate spillovers and enable accurate platform-level effect measurement.

Result: Experiments showed reduced interference effects and estimation variance compared to baselines. Deployment in a large-scale marketplace validated its practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Competitive Isolation PSM-DID offers unbiased estimation for platform-level metrics under mutual exclusion conditions, proving its theoretical and practical capabilities in addressing marketplace interference.

Abstract: Evaluating platform-level interventions in search-based two-sided
marketplaces is fundamentally challenged by systemic effects such as spillovers
and network interference. While widely used for causal inference, the PSM
(Propensity Score Matching) - DID (Difference-in-Differences) framework remains
susceptible to selection bias and cross-unit interference from unaccounted
spillovers. In this paper, we introduced Competitive Isolation PSM-DID, a novel
causal framework that integrates propensity score matching with competitive
isolation to enable platform-level effect measurement (e.g., order volume, GMV)
instead of item-level metrics in search systems.
  Our approach provides theoretically guaranteed unbiased estimation under
mutual exclusion conditions, with an open dataset released to support
reproducible research on marketplace interference (github.com/xxxx). Extensive
experiments demonstrate significant reductions in interference effects and
estimation variance compared to baseline methods. Successful deployment in a
large-scale marketplace confirms the framework's practical utility for
platform-level causal inference.

*Giuseppe Riva,Brenda K. Wiederhold,Fabrizia Mantovani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper draws parallels between the cognitive processes of hypnotized minds and the operations of large language models (LLMs), highlighting similarities like automaticity, reliance on context, and lack of subjective agency. The authors suggest hybrid AI architectures inspired by human mind dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the functional similarities between hypnosis and LLMs, revealing insights into how both systems operate and their implications for understanding AI and consciousness.

Method: The review focuses on three principles—automaticity, suppressed monitoring, and heightened contextual dependency—discussing concepts like functional agency and scheming to analyze parallels between hypnotized minds and LLMs.

Result: The analysis shows that both hypnosis and LLMs produce coherent but ungrounded outputs, exhibit goal-directed behavior without subjective awareness, and demonstrate similar behavior arising from structural and contextual factors.

Conclusion: Hypnosis offers insights into the dissociation of intention from consciousness, helping to understand the hidden motivational dynamics of artificial systems. For reliable AI development, integrating generative fluency with executive monitoring mechanisms is proposed, inspired by human cognitive architectures.

Abstract: The cognitive processes of the hypnotized mind and the computational
operations of large language models (LLMs) share deep functional parallels.
Both systems generate sophisticated, contextually appropriate behavior through
automatic pattern-completion mechanisms operating with limited or unreliable
executive oversight. This review examines this convergence across three
principles: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather
than deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as
confabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual
dependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or
the prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.
  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems
produce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to
supply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the
capacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without
subjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that
defines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can
emerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural
and contextual dynamics. Finally, both domains illuminate the phenomenon of
scheming: automatic, goal-directed pattern generation that unfolds without
reflective awareness. Hypnosis provides an experimental model for understanding
how intention can become dissociated from conscious deliberation, offering
insights into the hidden motivational dynamics of artificial systems.
Recognizing these parallels suggests that the future of reliable AI lies in
hybrid architectures that integrate generative fluency with mechanisms of
executive monitoring, an approach inspired by the complex, self-regulating
architecture of the human mind.

### [44] [Align to Misalign: Automatic LLM Jailbreak with Meta-Optimized LLM Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01375)
*Hamin Koo,Minseon Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMIS, a framework to optimize jailbreak prompts for LLMs by refining attack prompts and scoring templates to achieve higher success rates in exploiting model vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety of LLMs by identifying vulnerabilities and bypassing their safeguards for red-teaming purposes.

Method: AMIS employs a bi-level meta-optimization framework where prompts are refined iteratively with dense feedback, and scoring templates evolve gradually to align better with attack outcomes.

Result: Evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art attack success rates, achieving 88% on Claude-3.5-Haiku and 100% on Claude-4-Sonnet, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: AMIS is highly effective in strengthening jailbreak prompts and refining scoring templates, enhancing the exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Identifying the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for improving their safety by addressing inherent weaknesses. Jailbreaks, in
which adversaries bypass safeguards with crafted input prompts, play a central
role in red-teaming by probing LLMs to elicit unintended or unsafe behaviors.
Recent optimization-based jailbreak approaches iteratively refine attack
prompts by leveraging LLMs. However, they often rely heavily on either binary
attack success rate (ASR) signals, which are sparse, or manually crafted
scoring templates, which introduce human bias and uncertainty in the scoring
outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce AMIS (Align to MISalign),
a meta-optimization framework that jointly evolves jailbreak prompts and
scoring templates through a bi-level structure. In the inner loop, prompts are
refined using fine-grained and dense feedback using a fixed scoring template.
In the outer loop, the template is optimized using an ASR alignment score,
gradually evolving to better reflect true attack outcomes across queries. This
co-optimization process yields progressively stronger jailbreak prompts and
more calibrated scoring signals. Evaluations on AdvBench and JBB-Behaviors
demonstrate that AMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 88.0%
ASR on Claude-3.5-Haiku and 100.0% ASR on Claude-4-Sonnet, outperforming
existing baselines by substantial margins.

### [45] [Relaxing partition admissibility in Cluster-DAGs: a causal calculus with arbitrary variable clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01396)
*Clément Yvernes,Emilie Devijver,Adèle H. Ribeiro,Marianne Clausel--Lesourd,Éric Gaussier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper extends Cluster DAGs to handle cyclic representations, enabling causal reasoning with arbitrary variable clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cluster DAGs traditionally require acyclic representations, limiting their application in cases where clusters induce cycles. Extending them addresses current limitations in causal reasoning.

Method: The authors relaxed the partition admissibility constraints to support cyclic C-DAGs and expanded d-separation and causal calculus notions for this broader scope.

Result: The proposed system allows cluster-level causal reasoning in cyclic scenarios with a sound and atomically complete calculus, aligning with do-calculus.

Conclusion: The extension broadens causal reasoning applicability, making C-DAGs useful even in structurally complex setups with cycles and arbitrary clustering.

Abstract: Cluster DAGs (C-DAGs) provide an abstraction of causal graphs in which nodes
represent clusters of variables, and edges encode both cluster-level causal
relationships and dependencies arisen from unobserved confounding. C-DAGs
define an equivalence class of acyclic causal graphs that agree on
cluster-level relationships, enabling causal reasoning at a higher level of
abstraction. However, when the chosen clustering induces cycles in the
resulting C-DAG, the partition is deemed inadmissible under conventional C-DAG
semantics. In this work, we extend the C-DAG framework to support arbitrary
variable clusterings by relaxing the partition admissibility constraint,
thereby allowing cyclic C-DAG representations. We extend the notions of
d-separation and causal calculus to this setting, significantly broadening the
scope of causal reasoning across clusters and enabling the application of
C-DAGs in previously intractable scenarios. Our calculus is both sound and
atomically complete with respect to the do-calculus: all valid interventional
queries at the cluster level can be derived using our rules, each corresponding
to a primitive do-calculus step.

*Amrapali Pednekar,Álvaro Garrido-Pérez,Yara Khaluf,Pieter Simoens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI agents process time in a dual-task system, showcasing parallels with human timing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the parallels between AI emergent behavior in dual-task scenarios and human timing behavior.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents were trained separately on single and dual-task environments based on a simplified version of the Overcooked environment. Their performance and neural dynamics were analyzed.

Result: The dual-task agents exhibited significant overproduction of time compared to single-task agents, with no clear evidence of a dedicated timer in the agents' neural dynamics.

Conclusion: The study highlights behavioral similarities between AI agents and humans in time processing, calling for further investigations into underlying mechanisms in the agents.

Abstract: This study explores the interference in temporal processing within a
dual-task paradigm from an artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. In this
context, the dual-task setup is implemented as a simplified version of the
Overcooked environment with two variations, single task (T) and dual task
(T+N). Both variations involve an embedded time production task, but the dual
task (T+N) additionally involves a concurrent number comparison task. Two deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) agents were separately trained for each of these
tasks. These agents exhibited emergent behavior consistent with human timing
research. Specifically, the dual task (T+N) agent exhibited significant
overproduction of time relative to its single task (T) counterpart. This result
was consistent across four target durations. Preliminary analysis of neural
dynamics in the agents' LSTM layers did not reveal any clear evidence of a
dedicated or intrinsic timer. Hence, further investigation is needed to better
understand the underlying time-keeping mechanisms of the agents and to provide
insights into the observed behavioral patterns. This study is a small step
towards exploring parallels between emergent DRL behavior and behavior observed
in biological systems in order to facilitate a better understanding of both.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI explanation model for high-stakes domains, emphasizing verifiability, with improved diagnostic accuracy through reinforcement learning and auditable visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust in AI models used in critical domains like medicine by providing verifiable and transparent explanations for their decisions.

Method: An interactive agent is created to generate explanations using auditable actions. It employs reinforcement learning to optimize a policy for selecting external visual evidence that supports diagnostic reasoning. A causal intervention technique validates explanation faithfulness.

Result: The model achieves significant improvement in calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18%. Causal intervention confirms that chosen evidence is crucial, as performance degrades when the evidence is masked ($\Delta$Brier=+0.029).

Conclusion: This work establishes a practical framework for designing AI systems with verifiable and trustworthy reasoning processes.

Abstract: Explanations for AI models in high-stakes domains like medicine often lack
verifiability, which can hinder trust. To address this, we propose an
interactive agent that produces explanations through an auditable sequence of
actions. The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual
evidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using
reinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and
generalizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process
significantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\%
compared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the
agent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the
visual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation
in its performance ($\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is
integral to its decision-making process. Our work provides a practical
framework for building AI systems with verifiable and faithful reasoning
capabilities.

### [48] [Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis via Double Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01444)
*Huiting Huang,Tieliang Gong,Kai He,Jialun Wu,Erik Cambria,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses key limitations in multimodal sentiment analysis by proposing a Double Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy for robust and efficient representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal sentiment analysis approaches are limited by noise-contaminated data and inadequate fusion strategies, leading to loss of discriminative unimodal information and retention of redundant multimodal information.

Method: The Double Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy uses low-rank Renyi's entropy to enhance representation learning, combining unimodal compression and a novel attention bottleneck fusion mechanism to achieve a robust multimodal representation.

Result: Experiments show improvement in accuracy and F1-score across datasets such as CMU-MOSI and CH-SIMS, with reduced performance degradation under noise conditions, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DIB effectively filters noise and captures inter-modal complementarity, demonstrating superior robustness and accuracy in multimodal sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis has received significant attention across
diverse research domains. Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing
approaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of
noise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal
interactions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in
discarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal
redundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
Double Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified
compact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank
Renyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse
noise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as
compared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises
two key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of
individual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and
discarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative
ability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck
fusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that
effectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing
inter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
CH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method. The model
achieves 47.4% accuracy under the Acc-7 metric on CMU-MOSI and 81.63% F1-score
on CH-SIMS, outperforming the second-best baseline by 1.19%. Under noise, it
shows only 0.36% and 0.29% performance degradation on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI
respectively.

*ChengZhang Yu,YingRu He,Hongyan Cheng,nuo Cheng,Zhixing Liu,Dongxu Mu,Zhangrui Shen,Zhanpeng Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hierarchical multi-agent AI framework for medical pre-consultation tasks improved triage and case history collection in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses critical challenges facing global healthcare systems, such as increasing patient volumes, limited consultation times, and the need for efficient pre-consultation processes.

Method: The study implemented an eight-agent hierarchical framework with centralized control to handle four primary pre-consultation tasks (triage, history of present illness, past medical history, and chief complaint generation). It used 1,372 validated medical records and tested across multiple AI models.

Result: The framework achieved high accuracy in triage (87.0% for primary classification and 80.5% for secondary classification) and received high clinical quality scores from physicians. It improved task completion rates (98.2% using autonomous agent scheduling) and preserved data privacy with local deployment.

Conclusion: The model-agnostic AI framework demonstrates potential for transforming healthcare pre-consultation processes, offering enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and privacy-preserving solutions in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Global healthcare systems face critical challenges from increasing patient
volumes and limited consultation times, with primary care visits averaging
under 5 minutes in many countries. While pre-consultation processes
encompassing triage and structured history-taking offer potential solutions,
they remain limited by passive interaction paradigms and context management
challenges in existing AI systems. This study introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent framework that transforms passive medical AI systems into proactive
inquiry agents through autonomous task orchestration. We developed an
eight-agent architecture with centralized control mechanisms that decomposes
pre-consultation into four primary tasks: Triage ($T_1$), History of Present
Illness collection ($T_2$), Past History collection ($T_3$), and Chief
Complaint generation ($T_4$), with $T_1$--$T_3$ further divided into 13
domain-specific subtasks. Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health
records from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models
(GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for
primary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification,
with task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus
93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians
averaged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and
4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within
12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic
architecture maintained high performance across different foundation models
while preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the
potential for autonomous AI systems to enhance pre-consultation efficiency and
quality in clinical settings.

### [50] [TPS-Bench: Evaluating AI Agents' Tool Planning \& Scheduling Abilities in Compounding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01527)
*Hanwen Xu,Xuyao Huang,Yuzhe Liu,Kai Yu,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TPS-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' ability in tool planning and scheduling to solve compounding real-world tasks, finding differences in completion rates and efficiencies of models like GLM-4.5 and GPT-4o, with reinforcement learning showing promising improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate if LLM agents can efficiently solve real-world problems involving diverse tools and strategies for planning and scheduling.

Method: Develop TPS-Bench with 200 tasks requiring tools from a heterogeneous repository, evaluating completion rate, and efficiency. Additionally, test RL methods to improve efficiency and performance.

Result: GLM-4.5 achieved high completion rates but at the cost of efficiency; GPT-4o focused on parallel tool calls at a lower completion rate. RL applied to Qwen3-1.7B reduced execution time by 14% and improved completion rate by 6%.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show promising tool planning capabilities but could benefit from improved scheduling strategies. Reinforcement learning holds potential to enhance efficiency and task performance further.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have exhibited strong problem-solving
competence across domains like research and coding. Yet, it remains
underexplored whether LLM agents can tackle compounding real-world problems
that require a diverse set of tools to complete. Given a broad, heterogeneous
tool repository, LLM agents must not only select appropriate tools based on
task planning analysis but also strategically schedule the execution order to
ensure efficiency. This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of
LLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling.
TPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a
tool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In
particular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map
navigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a
basic tool. Our evaluation emphasizes both task completion rate and efficiency.
The empirical studies on popular closed-source and open-source LLMs indicate
that most models can perform reasonable tool planning, but differ in
scheduling. For example, GLM-4.5 achieves an outperforming task completion rate
of 64.72% with extensive sequential tool calls, hence suffering from
significantly long execution time. By contrast, GPT-4o prioritizes parallel
tool calls but achieves only a 45.08% completion rate. Considering
reinforcement learning (RL) can be a viable way to improve the scheduling
efficiency without compromising performance, we perform an initial study on
Qwen3-1.7B and witness a 14% reduction in execution time alongside a 6% gain in
task completion rate based on rarely 100 RL training samples. Our code is
available https://github.com/hanwenxu1/mcp-agent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal analysis pipeline using foundation models to study corporate social media’s sustainability messaging, focusing on both text and visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current corporate social media messaging on sustainability is evolving, multimodal, and often ambiguous, requiring efficient and scalable methods to analyze such communication.

Method: An ensemble of large language models (LLMs) is employed to annotate corporate tweets concerning the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Vision-language models (VLMs) analyze visual patterns via semantic clusters.

Result: The integrated pipeline uncovers sector-specific differences, temporal trends, and correlations between corporate messaging and ESG risks, as well as consumer engagement.

Conclusion: The proposed methods are scalable, domain-flexible, and broadly applicable for large-scale social media analysis, transcending task-specific annotations by using foundation models effectively.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a multimodal analysis pipeline that leverages
large foundation models in vision and language to analyze corporate social
media content, with a focus on sustainability-related communication. Addressing
the challenges of evolving, multimodal, and often ambiguous corporate messaging
on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), we employ an ensemble of large
language models (LLMs) to annotate a large corpus of corporate tweets on their
topical alignment with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This
approach avoids the need for costly, task-specific annotations and explores the
potential of such models as ad-hoc annotators for social media data that can
efficiently capture both explicit and implicit references to sustainability
themes in a scalable manner. Complementing this textual analysis, we utilize
vision-language models (VLMs), within a visual understanding framework that
uses semantic clusters to uncover patterns in visual sustainability
communication. This integrated approach reveals sectoral differences in SDG
engagement, temporal trends, and associations between corporate messaging,
environmental, social, governance (ESG) risks, and consumer engagement. Our
methods-automatic label generation and semantic visual clustering-are broadly
applicable to other domains and offer a flexible framework for large-scale
social media analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExplicitLM introduces an architecture with million-scale external memory for more interpretable and updatable language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with stale knowledge and lack reasoning transparency due to implicit network parameters.

Method: ExplicitLM uses an external memory bank with human-readable knowledge and a two-stage retrieval mechanism, combining coarse filtering and fine-grained matching.

Result: ExplicitLM demonstrates up to 43.67% improvement in knowledge-intensive tasks and significant gains in low-data settings.

Conclusion: ExplicitLM achieves competitive performance while offering knowledge transparency and updateability.

Abstract: Large language models suffer from knowledge staleness and lack of
interpretability due to implicit knowledge storage across entangled network
parameters, preventing targeted updates and reasoning transparency. We propose
ExplicitLM, a novel architecture featuring a million-scale external memory bank
storing human-readable knowledge as token sequences, enabling direct inspection
and modification. We design a differentiable two-stage retrieval mechanism with
efficient coarse-grained filtering via product key decomposition (reducing
complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot |I|)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N} \cdot
|I|)$) and fine-grained Gumbel-Softmax matching for end-to-end training.
Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we partition knowledge into frozen
explicit facts (20%) and learnable implicit patterns (80%), maintained through
Exponential Moving Average updates for stability. ExplicitLM achieves up to
43.67% improvement on knowledge-intensive tasks versus standard Transformers,
with 3.62$\times$ gains in low-data regimes (10k samples). Analysis shows
strong correlations between memory retrieval and performance, with correct
predictions achieving 49% higher hit rates. Unlike RAG systems with frozen
retrieval, our jointly optimized architecture demonstrates that interpretable,
updatable models can maintain competitive performance while providing
unprecedented knowledge transparency.

*Sicheng Wang,Shuhao Chen,Jingran Zhou,Chengyi Tu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a new dynamic graph neural network, IVGAE-TAMA-BO, to enhance trade link prediction in global food networks by modeling temporal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global food trade plays a vital role in ensuring food security, but dynamic network structures influenced by external factors make predicting future trade links difficult.

Method: The proposed model combines the IVGAE framework with Trade-Aware Momentum Aggregator (TAMA) for capturing temporal trade dynamics and uses Bayesian optimization for tuning hyperparameters.

Result: Experiments on five crop-specific datasets demonstrate IVGAE-TAMA significantly outdoes static IVGAE and other methods in link prediction performance.

Conclusion: IVGAE-TAMA-BO provides a robust and scalable solution for predicting trade links in food networks, aiding in food security monitoring and policy support.

Abstract: Global food trade plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and
maintaining supply chain stability. However, its network structure evolves
dynamically under the influence of geopolitical, economic, and environmental
factors, making it challenging to model and predict future trade links.
Effectively capturing temporal patterns in food trade networks is therefore
essential for improving the accuracy and robustness of link prediction. This
study introduces IVGAE-TAMA-BO, a novel dynamic graph neural network designed
to model evolving trade structures and predict future links in global food
trade networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply
dynamic graph neural networks to this domain, significantly enhancing
predictive performance. Building upon the original IVGAE framework, the
proposed model incorporates a Trade-Aware Momentum Aggregator (TAMA) to capture
the temporal evolution of trade networks, jointly modeling short-term
fluctuations and long-term structural dependencies. A momentum-based structural
memory mechanism further improves predictive stability and performance. In
addition, Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune key
hyperparameters, enhancing generalization across diverse trade scenarios.
Extensive experiments on five crop-specific datasets demonstrate that
IVGAE-TAMA substantially outperforms the static IVGAE and other dynamic
baselines by effectively modeling temporal dependencies, while Bayesian
optimization further boosts performance in IVGAE-TAMA-BO. These results
highlight the proposed framework as a robust and scalable solution for
structural prediction in global trade networks, with strong potential for
applications in food security monitoring and policy decision support.

*Yueqing Xi,Yifan Bai,Huasen Luo,Weiliang Wen,Hui Liu,Haoliang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid AI agent designed for legal question answering that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and multi-model ensembling, significantly enhancing accuracy and reliability while reducing hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the accuracy, traceability, and reliability of answers in legal question answering is critical, as existing systems either hallucinate or fail to adapt to evolving legal standards.

Method: The system combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling. It prioritizes retrieving answers from trusted repositories and uses LLMs with scoring mechanisms when retrieval yields insufficient results. Human-reviewed outputs update the knowledge base dynamically.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved performance on the Law_QA dataset compared to baseline systems, with significant advances in metrics like F1, ROUGE-L, and a unique LLM-as-a-Judge measure.

Conclusion: This hybrid legal QA system reduces hallucination, improves answer quality, ensures legal compliance, and contributes to practical advancements in judicial forensics technologies.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence permeates judicial forensics, ensuring the
veracity and traceability of legal question answering (QA) has become critical.
Conventional large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, risking
misleading guidance in legal consultation, while static knowledge bases
struggle to keep pace with frequently updated statutes and case law. We present
a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver
reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes
retrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant
evidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate
candidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked
answer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being
written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and
provenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\_QA dataset show that our hybrid
approach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla
RAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm
the complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling,
and the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably
reduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance,
advancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial
scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper proposes two frameworks, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL, for scalable LLM agent training using simulated feedback, bypassing the need for real environment implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle in complex contexts requiring robustness across diverse tools and schemas, and existing bespoke environments for training are heavy and brittle.

Method: The authors introduce Simia-SFT to amplify small seed datasets into diverse trajectories using LLM simulation, and Simia-RL for RL training with simulated feedback instead of real environments.

Result: Fine-tuned open models demonstrated significant improvements across benchmarks, notably surpassing GPT-4o and nearing o4-mini performance on $$-Bench.

Conclusion: Using LLM-based simulation frameworks, this approach provides a scalable, flexible alternative to traditional environment engineering for LLM agent training.

Abstract: LLM agents excel in compact environments requiring deep reasoning but remain
brittle when operating in broader, more complex contexts that demand robustness
across diverse tools and schemas. Building bespoke environments for training is
heavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs
can simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed
data or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks:
Simia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets
into diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a
framework that enables RL training without real environment implementations
through LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent
improvements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching
o4-mini on $\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable
agent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle
implementations with flexible LLM-based simulation.

### [56] [PDA-LSTM: Knowledge-driven page data arrangement based on LSTM for LCM supression in QLC 3D NAND flash memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00075)
*Qianhui Li,Weiya Wang,Qianqi Zhao,Tong Qu,Jing He,Xuhong Qiang,Jingwen Hou,Ke Chen,Bao Zhang,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDA-LSTM, a neural network-based model, addressing lateral charge migration (LCM) in QLC 3D NAND flash memory by optimizing inter-page data arrangements, resulting in reduced bit error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QLC 3D NAND flash memory faces challenges in artificial intelligence storage due to narrow read margins and lateral charge migration (LCM) effects, necessitating efficient data arrangement strategies.

Method: PDA-LSTM uses a physics-informed LSTM neural network to compute probabilities for data arrangement, reducing LCM effects without adding extra flag bits, unlike WBVM and DVDS algorithms.

Result: PDA-LSTM achieves an 80.4% reduction in average bit error rate (BER) compared to no arrangement and outperforms WBVM and DVDS by 18.4% and 15.2%, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed PDA-LSTM demonstrates significant improvements in error management for QLC 3D NAND storage, making it a competitive alternative to existing data arrangement technologies.

Abstract: Quarter level cell (QLC) 3D NAND flash memory is emerging as the predominant
storage solution in the era of artificial intelligence. QLC 3D NAND flash
stores 4 bit per cell to expand the storage density, resulting in narrower read
margins. Constrained to read margins, QLC always suffers from lateral charge
migration (LCM), which caused by non-uniform charge density across adjacent
memory cells. To suppress charge density gap between cells, there are some
algorithm in form of intra-page data mapping such as WBVM, DVDS. However, we
observe inter-page data arrangements also approach the suppression. Thus, we
proposed an intelligent model PDA-LSTM to arrange intra-page data for LCM
suppression, which is a physics-knowledge-driven neural network model. PDA-LSTM
applies a long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network to compute a data
arrangement probability matrix from input page data pattern. The arrangement is
to minimize the global impacts derived from the LCM among wordlines. Since each
page data can be arranged only once, we design a transformation from output
matrix of LSTM network to non-repetitive sequence generation probability matrix
to assist training process. The arranged data pattern can decrease the bit
error rate (BER) during data retention. In addition, PDA-LSTM do not need extra
flag bits to record data transport of 3D NAND flash compared with WBVM, DVDS.
The experiment results show that the PDA-LSTM reduces the average BER by 80.4%
compared with strategy without data arrangement, and by 18.4%, 15.2% compared

### [57] [H-FA: A Hybrid Floating-Point and Logarithmic Approach to Hardware Accelerated FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00295)
*Kosmas Alexandridis,Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-FA, an optimized hardware implementation of FlashAttention that combines floating-point and fixed-point operations in the logarithm domain, achieving significant reductions in area and power while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FlashAttention, designed for GPUs, shows potential for hardware acceleration but faces inefficiencies in computational resource usage for long sequences.

Method: The authors propose H-FA, which utilizes floating-point arithmetic for initial attention computations and fixed-point logarithmic representations to simplify softmax normalization and fused matrix operations. The approach replaces complex computations with efficient arithmetic operations.

Result: The hardware implementation of H-FA at 28nm demonstrates 26.5% area reduction and 23.4% power savings compared to traditional floating-point FlashAttention architectures, with no performance degradation.

Conclusion: H-FA successfully addresses key computation inefficiencies in hardware implementation of FlashAttention, offering a more resource-efficient solution without compromising performance.

Abstract: Transformers have significantly advanced AI and machine learning through
their powerful attention mechanism. However, computing attention on long
sequences can become a computational bottleneck. FlashAttention mitigates this
by fusing the softmax and matrix operations into a tiled computation pattern
that decouples performance from sequence length. Though designed for GPUs, its
simplicity also makes it well suited for direct hardware acceleration. To
improve hardware implementation, we compute FlashAttention using a mixture of
floating-point and fixed-point logarithm domain representations. Floating-point
is used to compute attention scores from query and key matrices, while
logarithmic computation simplifies the fused computation of softmax
normalization and the multiplication with the value matrix. This
transformation, called H-FA, replaces vector-wide floating-point multiplication
and division operations by additions and subtractions implemented efficiently
with fixed-point arithmetic in the logarithm domain. Exponential function
evaluations are effectively omitted and fused with the rest operations, and the
final result is directly returned to floating-point arithmetic without any
additional hardware overhead. Hardware implementation results at 28nm
demonstrate that H-FA achieves a 26.5% reduction in area and a 23.4% reduction
in power, on average, compared to FlashAttention parallel hardware
architectures built solely with floating-point datapaths, without hindering
performance.

*Dowon Kim,MinJae Lee,Janghyeon Kim,HyuckSung Kwon,Hyeonggyu Jeong,Sang-Soo Park,Minyong Yoon,Si-Dong Roh,Yongsuk Kwon,Jinin So,Jungwook Choi*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents a scalable Processing-Near-Memory (PNM) system for managing large context windows in large language models (LLMs), significantly improving efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the memory and compute bottlenecks introduced by expanding context windows in LLMs to multi-million tokens, particularly in efficiently managing the Key-Value (KV) cache.

Method: The paper introduces a novel PNM accelerator integrated with Compute Express Link (CXL) memory for managing KV-cache. It offloads token page selection to the PNM accelerator, eliminating costly data recalls and enabling larger batch sizes, while incorporating advanced hybrid parallelization and steady-token selection mechanisms.

Result: The proposed system achieves up to 21.9x throughput improvement, up to 60x lower energy per token, and up to 7.3x higher cost efficiency in handling LLMs with up to 405 billion parameters and 1-million-token contexts.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that CXL-enabled PNM architectures are a promising scalable backbone for future long-context LLM inference tasks, addressing key bottlenecks in computation and memory management.

Abstract: The expansion of context windows in large language models (LLMs) to
multi-million tokens introduces severe memory and compute bottlenecks,
particularly in managing the growing Key-Value (KV) cache. While Compute
Express Link (CXL) enables non-eviction frameworks that offload the full
KV-cache to scalable external memory, these frameworks still suffer from costly
data transfers when recalling non-resident KV tokens to limited GPU memory as
context lengths increase. This work proposes scalable Processing-Near-Memory
(PNM) for 1M-Token LLM Inference, a CXL-enabled KV-cache management system that
coordinates memory and computation beyond GPU limits. Our design offloads token
page selection to a PNM accelerator within CXL memory, eliminating costly
recalls and enabling larger GPU batch sizes. We further introduce a hybrid
parallelization strategy and a steady-token selection mechanism to enhance
compute efficiency and scalability. Implemented atop a state-of-the-art CXL-PNM
system, our solution delivers consistent performance gains for LLMs with up to
405B parameters and 1M-token contexts. Our PNM-only offloading scheme (PNM-KV)
and GPU-PNM hybrid with steady-token execution (PnG-KV) achieve up to 21.9x
throughput improvement, up to 60x lower energy per token, and up to 7.3x better
total cost efficiency than the baseline, demonstrating that CXL-enabled
multi-PNM architectures can serve as a scalable backbone for future
long-context LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chiplet-based systems address issues in monolithic chips like manufacturing challenges, power efficiency, and scaling limitations.

Method: A detailed simulation model of chiplet-based systems was built in VisualSim, including ARM multicore processors and ARM CMN600 NoC for performance evaluations.

Result: Critical metrics, such as inter-chiplet communication latency, memory efficiency, workload distribution, were analyzed, providing performance insights.

Conclusion: Simulation insights can optimize chiplet-based architectures for improved semiconductor designs in future.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the simulation of multi-die System-on-Chip (SoC)
architectures using VisualSim, emphasiz- ing chiplet-based system modeling and
performance analysis. Chiplet technology presents a promising alternative to
traditional monolithic chips, which face increasing challenges in manufactur-
ing costs, power efficiency, and performance scaling. By integrat- ing multiple
small modular silicon units into a single package, chiplet-based architectures
offer greater flexibility and scalability at a lower overall cost. In this
study, we developed a detailed sim- ulation model of a chiplet-based system,
incorporating multicore ARM processor clusters interconnected through a ARM
CMN600 network-on-chip (NoC) for efficient communication [4], [7]. The
simulation framework in VisualSim enables the evaluation of critical system
metrics, including inter-chiplet communication latency, memory access
efficiency, workload distribution, and the power-performance tradeoff under
various workloads. Through simulation-driven insights, this research highlights
key factors influencing chiplet system performance and provides a foundation
for optimizing future chiplet-based semiconductor designs.

### [60] [A Two Level Neural Approach Combining Off-Chip Prediction with Adaptive Prefetch Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15181)
*Alexandre Valentin Jamet,Georgios Vavouliotis,Daniel A. Jiménez,Lluc Alvarez,Marc Casas*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents the Two Level Perceptron (TLP) predictor, a neural mechanism for enhancing performance and energy efficiency in applications with large data footprints by combining off-chip prediction with adaptive prefetch filtering at the L1D cache level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current applications with large data footprints suffer from performance and energy overheads, necessitating more efficient methods to predict off-chip data access and optimize prefetch filtering.

Method: TLP uses two microarchitectural perceptron predictors called FLP (for off-chip prediction) and SLP (for L1D prefetch filtering). FLP leverages virtual addresses and selective delay components, while SLP integrates physical addresses and FLP predictions.

Result: TLP reduces average DRAM transactions by 30.7% (single-core) and 17.7% (multi-core) compared to baseline prefetchers. It achieves geometric mean performance improvements of 6.2% and 11.8% for single-core and multi-core workloads, respectively.

Conclusion: TLP provides an innovative, lightweight (7KB storage) neural solution to off-chip prediction and prefetch filtering that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and maintains effectiveness across different L1D prefetching logics.

Abstract: To alleviate the performance and energy overheads of contemporary
applications with large data footprints, we propose the Two Level Perceptron
(TLP) predictor, a neural mechanism that effectively combines predicting
whether an access will be off-chip with adaptive prefetch filtering at the
first-level data cache (L1D). TLP is composed of two connected
microarchitectural perceptron predictors, named First Level Predictor (FLP) and
Second Level Predictor (SLP). FLP performs accurate off-chip prediction by
using several program features based on virtual addresses and a novel selective
delay component. The novelty of SLP relies on leveraging off-chip prediction to
drive L1D prefetch filtering by using physical addresses and the FLP prediction
as features. TLP constitutes the first hardware proposal targeting both
off-chip prediction and prefetch filtering using a multi-level perceptron
hardware approach. TLP only requires 7KB of storage. To demonstrate the
benefits of TLP we compare its performance with state-of-the-art approaches
using off-chip prediction and prefetch filtering on a wide range of single-core
and multi-core workloads. Our experiments show that TLP reduces the average
DRAM transactions by 30.7% and 17.7%, as compared to a baseline using
state-of-the-art cache prefetchers but no off-chip prediction mechanism, across
the single-core and multi-core workloads, respectively, while recent work
significantly increases DRAM transactions. As a result, TLP achieves geometric
mean performance speedups of 6.2% and 11.8% across single-core and multi-core
workloads, respectively. In addition, our evaluation demonstrates that TLP is
effective independently of the L1D prefetching logic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) lack proficiency in creating complex visualizations for structured data. PlotCraft benchmark and SynthVis-30K dataset are introduced to address this gap. A new model, PlotCraftor, demonstrates improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and improve LLMs' ability to handle complex data visualization tasks, as current capabilities are insufficient.

Method: Introduced the PlotCraft benchmark assessing visualization tasks, developed SynthVis-30K dataset using a collaborative agent framework, and created PlotCraftor model for enhanced visualization code generation.

Result: PlotCraftor achieves strong performance and overcomes deficiencies in sophisticated visualization tasks, particularly excelling in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: PlotCraft benchmark, SynthVis-30K dataset, and PlotCraftor model collectively advance the capability of LLMs in complex visualization. Resources will be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable profi-
ciency in code generation. However, their ability to create complex visualiza-
tions for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and
underdevel- oped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark
featuring 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics,
such as fi- nance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is
structured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48
distinct chart types. Cru- cially, it is the first to systematically evaluate
both single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum
of task complexities. Our com- prehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on
PlotCraft reveals obvious per- formance deficiencies in handling sophisticated
visualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K,
a large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized
via a collaborative agent frame- work. Building upon this dataset, we develope
PlotCraftor, a novel code gener- ation model that achieves strong capabilities
in complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval,
PandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance
comparable to that of leading propri- etary approaches. Especially, on hard
task, Our model achieves over 50% per- formance improvement. We will release
the benchmark, dataset, and code at

### [62] [Cognitive Alignment in Personality Reasoning: Leveraging Prototype Theory for MBTI Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00115)
*Haoyuan Li,Yuanbo Tong,Yuchen Li,Zirui Wang,Chunhou Liu,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoMBTI introduces a novel MBTI personality recognition framework aligned with prototype theory, achieving improved accuracy and generalization through LLM-based pipeline and prototype reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for MBTI personality recognition focus on hard-label classification, neglecting the nuanced and prototype-like nature of human personality judgments.

Method: ProtoMBTI incorporates prototype theory using an LLM-based pipeline. This includes corpus construction via LLM-guided augmentation, fine-tuning lightweight encoders with LoRA, embedding personality prototypes, and integrating evidence through a prototype retrieval and revision cycle.

Result: ProtoMBTI outperforms baseline models on MBTI classification tasks and demonstrates superior generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: Prototype-aligned inference improves text-based personality modeling in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-dataset transferability.

Abstract: Personality recognition from text is typically cast as hard-label
classification, which obscures the graded, prototype-like nature of human
personality judgments. We present ProtoMBTI, a cognitively aligned framework
for MBTI inference that operationalizes prototype theory within an LLM-based
pipeline. First, we construct a balanced, quality-controlled corpus via
LLM-guided multi-dimensional augmentation (semantic, linguistic, sentiment).
Next, we LoRA-fine-tune a lightweight (<=2B) encoder to learn discriminative
embeddings and to standardize a bank of personality prototypes. At inference,
we retrieve top-k prototypes for a query post and perform a
retrieve--reuse--revise--retain cycle: the model aggregates prototype evidence
via prompt-based voting, revises when inconsistencies arise, and, upon correct
prediction, retains the sample to continually enrich the prototype library.
Across Kaggle and Pandora benchmarks, ProtoMBTI improves over baselines on both
the four MBTI dichotomies and the full 16-type task, and exhibits robust
cross-dataset generalization. Our results indicate that aligning the inference
process with psychological prototype reasoning yields gains in accuracy,
interpretability, and transfer for text-based personality modeling.

*Nicky Pochinkov,Yulia Volkova,Anna Vasileva,Sai V R Chereddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Residual Stream Decoders for probing language models' activations, focusing on how they encode longer-term planning information for paragraph and document-scale tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how language models encode activations for long time-horizon tasks rather than solely testing concepts or tokens.

Method: Developing and evaluating Residual Stream Decoders to probe model activations for longer term plans and decoding future context in small models.

Result: Demonstrated that information equivalent to 5+ tokens of future context can be decoded from activations in small models.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to monitoring language models and understanding their handling of longer-term planning information.

Abstract: Interpretability studies in language models often investigate forward-looking
representations of activations. However, as language models become capable of
doing ever longer time horizon tasks, methods for understanding activations
often remain limited to testing specific concepts or tokens. We develop a
framework of Residual Stream Decoders as a method of probing model activations
for paragraph-scale and document-scale plans. We test several methods and find
information can be decoded equivalent to 5+ tokens of future context in small
models. These results lay the groundwork for better monitoring of language
models and better understanding how they might encode longer-term planning
information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing large language models (LLMs) through targeted token prediction instead of next-token prediction, aiming to improve performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of enhancing model performance while controlling computational costs in training large language models (LLMs).

Method: The authors propose a novel training strategy where LLMs predict information-rich tokens rather than rely on next-token prediction. The approach is tested on arithmetic, text classification, and natural-language generation tasks.

Result: By employing the new targeted token prediction method, they demonstrate improvements in training efficiency and model performance across various tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a significant step forward in the optimization of LLM training methods, contributing to both practical performance enhancement and theoretical insights into token selection strategies.

Abstract: Optimizing training performance in large language models (LLMs) remains an
essential challenge, particularly in improving model performance while
maintaining computational costs. This work challenges the conventional approach
of training LLMs using next-token prediction (NTP), arguing that by predicting
information-rich tokens during training, there is a more effective way to train
LLMs. We investigate the impact of the proposed solution in three kinds of
tasks for LLMs: arithmetic, multi-label classification of text, and
natural-language generation. This work offers a principled approach to
optimizing LLM training, advancing both model performance and theoretical
understanding of the target-token selection strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of persona inconsistency in large language models (LLMs). It proposes evaluation metrics and employs reinforcement learning to enhance LLM performance, reducing inconsistency by over 55%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of LLM-generated personas drifting from their roles in settings like therapy, education, and social role-play, where coherence and consistency are critical.

Method: The authors developed three automatic metrics for persona consistency (prompt-to-line, line-to-line, and Q&A consistency) and validated them with human annotations. They used these metrics as rewards to fine-tune LLMs using reinforcement learning for multi-turn dialogues in different user roles.

Result: The proposed method reduced persona inconsistency in LLMs by over 55%, leading to improved coherence and faithful persona simulations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces a framework to evaluate and improve persona consistency in LLMs, making the models more reliable and effective in interactive scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human users in
interactive settings such as therapy, education, and social role-play. While
these simulations enable scalable training and evaluation of AI agents,
off-the-shelf LLMs often drift from their assigned personas, contradict earlier
statements, or abandon role-appropriate behavior. We introduce a unified
framework for evaluating and improving persona consistency in LLM-generated
dialogue. We define three automatic metrics: prompt-to-line consistency,
line-to-line consistency, and Q&A consistency, that capture different types of
persona drift and validate each against human annotations. Using these metrics
as reward signals, we apply multi-turn reinforcement learning to fine-tune LLMs
for three user roles: a patient, a student, and a social chat partner. Our
method reduces inconsistency by over 55%, resulting in more coherent and
faithful simulated users.

*Arman Anwar,Zefang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentBnB is a browser-based tool that uses large language model teammates to enhance cybersecurity training, addressing scalability and resource challenges inherent in traditional tabletop exercises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and scale cybersecurity tabletop exercises, which are resource-intensive and scripted, by leveraging large language model technology.

Method: The method includes integrating large language models with a retrieval-augmented copilot to generate cognitive hints, scaffold learning, and fade hints as learner confidence grows.

Result: A pilot study showed participants preferred AgentBnB over traditional exercises, citing scalability benefits, though a ceiling effect was noted in knowledge quiz outcomes.

Conclusion: AgentBnB demonstrates potential for lightweight, scalable cybersecurity training. Future developments aim at multiplayer modes, advanced coaching, and broader validation among larger user groups.

Abstract: Traditional cybersecurity tabletop exercises (TTXs) provide valuable training
but are often scripted, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale. We
introduce AgentBnB, a browser-based re-imagining of the Backdoors & Breaches
game that integrates large language model teammates with a Bloom-aligned,
retrieval-augmented copilot (C2D2). The system expands a curated corpus into
factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive snippets, delivering
on-demand, cognitively targeted hints. Prompt-engineered agents employ a
scaffolding ladder that gradually fades as learner confidence grows. In a
solo-player pilot with four graduate students, participants reported greater
intention to use the agent-based version compared to the physical card deck and
viewed it as more scalable, though a ceiling effect emerged on a simple
knowledge quiz. Despite limitations of small sample size, single-player focus,
and narrow corpus, these early findings suggest that large language model
augmented TTXs can provide lightweight, repeatable practice without the
logistical burden of traditional exercises. Planned extensions include
multi-player modes, telemetry-driven coaching, and comparative studies with
larger cohorts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IL-PCR, a joint testbed for statute and precedent retrieval in legal cases, addressing their interrelated nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Law practitioners require tools to efficiently retrieve statutes and prior cases for legal situations. Existing methods treat these tasks separately, missing their inherent connection.

Method: The authors propose IL-PCR, a legal corpus for combined retrieval of statutes and precedents, experimenting with baseline models including lexical, semantic, and GNN-based ensemble models. They further develop an LLM-based re-ranking method for improved performance.

Result: The IL-PCR corpus effectively shows the dependence between statute retrieval and precedent retrieval, and the LLM-based re-ranking method demonstrates superior results compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: Combining both retrieval tasks through IL-PCR and using advanced methods like LLM-based re-ranking improves legal information retrieval, highlighting their inherent interrelation.

Abstract: Identifying/retrieving relevant statutes and prior cases/precedents for a
given legal situation are common tasks exercised by law practitioners.
Researchers to date have addressed the two tasks independently, thus developing
completely different datasets and models for each task; however, both retrieval
tasks are inherently related, e.g., similar cases tend to cite similar statutes
(due to similar factual situation). In this paper, we address this gap. We
propose IL-PCR (Indian Legal corpus for Prior Case and Statute Retrieval),
which is a unique corpus that provides a common testbed for developing models
for both the tasks (Statute Retrieval and Precedent Retrieval) that can exploit
the dependence between the two. We experiment extensively with several baseline
models on the tasks, including lexical models, semantic models and ensemble
based on GNNs. Further, to exploit the dependence between the two tasks, we
develop an LLM-based re-ranking approach that gives the best performance.

TL;DR: POSESTITCH-SLT enhances sign language translation using template-driven sentence generation, improving BLEU-4 scores on How2Sign and iSign datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of sign language translation due to sparse datasets by exploring template-driven methods for synthetic sentence generation.

Method: A pre-training scheme (POSESTITCH-SLT) utilizing linguistic template-based sentence generation combined with a transformer-based architecture.

Result: BLEU-4 scores improved significantly: from 1.97 to 4.56 on How2Sign and from 0.55 to 3.43 on iSign datasets.

Conclusion: Template-driven synthetic supervision is highly effective for low-resource sign language translation.

Abstract: Sign language translation remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
large-scale, sentence-aligned datasets. Prior arts have focused on various
feature extraction and architectural changes to support neural machine
translation for sign languages. We propose POSESTITCH-SLT, a novel pre-training
scheme that is inspired by linguistic-templates-based sentence generation
technique. With translation comparison on two sign language datasets, How2Sign
and iSign, we show that a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture
outperforms the prior art when considering template-generated sentence pairs in
training. We achieve BLEU-4 score improvements from 1.97 to 4.56 on How2Sign
and from 0.55 to 3.43 on iSign, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods for
pose-based gloss-free translation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of
template-driven synthetic supervision in low-resource sign language settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient RNN architectures that compete with Transformer models in short-context tasks while also excelling in long-context generalization.

Method: Factorization Memory builds on Mamba-2 with parallel training capabilities and constant computational/memory complexity during inference. A sparse update mechanism is introduced to enhance efficiency and representational capacity.

Result: Factorization Memory achieves comparable performance to Transformers on short-context tasks and superior generalization in long-context scenarios. It combines sparse memory activation with competitive results.

Conclusion: Factorization Memory represents a significant advancement in RNN architecture, offering a sparse activation mechanism and efficiency while excelling in diverse context scenarios.

Abstract: We propose Factorization Memory, an efficient recurrent neural network (RNN)
architecture that achieves performance comparable to Transformer models on
short-context language modeling tasks while also demonstrating superior
generalization in long-context scenarios. Our model builds upon Mamba-2,
enabling Factorization Memory to exploit parallel computations during training
while preserving constant computational and memory complexity during inference.
To further optimize model efficiency and representational capacity, we develop
a sparse formulation of Factorization Memory that updates only a subset of
recurrent states at each step while preserving the strong performance of its
dense counterpart. To our knowledge, this represents the first RNN architecture
that successfully combines sparse memory activation with competitive
performance across both short and long-context settings. This work provides a
systematic empirical analysis of Factorization Memory in comparison to
Transformer and Mamba-2 architectures.

*Mihir Sahasrabudhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies a structural property of causal language modeling objectives called reversal invariance, and suggests its limitations in capturing natural language's directional dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inadequacy of current language model pretraining objectives, highlighting their inability to account for directional dependencies inherent in natural language.

Method: The authors formalize and analyze the concept of reversal invariance within causal language modeling, exploring the symmetry in standard pretraining methods.

Result: It is shown that models trained on reversed text perform comparably to those trained on forward text, demonstrating the direction-blind nature of current pretraining objectives.

Conclusion: The paper argues for a shift in focus toward pretraining objectives and architectures that incorporate temporal asymmetry to better capture the directional nature of language.

Abstract: We formalize a structural property of the causal (autoregressive) language
modeling (CLM) objective: reversal invariance. Formally, the next-token
prediction loss assigns identical likelihood to a corpus and its reversal,
implying that standard CLM pretraining is direction-blind. This symmetry
explains why models trained on reversed text can achieve comparable performance
to those trained on forward text, despite the inherently time-asymmetric nature
of human language and reasoning. We argue that this invariance represents a
limitation of current pretraining objectives rather than a benign artifact. If
natural language encodes directional dependencies - phonological,
morphological, or causal - a symmetric objective may fail to capture them. We
therefore propose viewing pretraining through the lens of temporal asymmetry,
motivating future work on loss functions and architectures that explicitly
model the arrow of language while retaining standard language modeling
capacity.

TL;DR: The paper presents LingGym, a benchmark for testing LLMs' metalinguistic reasoning across diverse low-resource languages using Interlinear Glossed Text and grammatical descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of LLMs to perform linguistic inference in typologically diverse and low-resource languages beyond specific downstream tasks.

Method: Proposed a controlled evaluation task, Word-Gloss Inference, requiring LLMs to infer missing words and glosses using structured linguistic information such as glosses and grammatical explanations.

Result: Structured linguistic information enhances reasoning performance across all tested LLMs. Results showcase both potential and current shortcomings of LLMs in linguistic analysis.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates structured linguistic cues improve LLM performance for low-resource language analysis, but limitations remain, suggesting further development is needed for typologically informed linguistic analysis.

Abstract: This paper introduces LingGym, a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' capacity
for meta-linguistic reasoning using Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) and
grammatical descriptions extracted from 18 typologically diverse reference
grammars. Unlike previous work that focuses on specific downstream tasks, we
assess whether LLMs can generalize linguistic inference across low-resource
languages and structures not seen during training. We present a controlled
evaluation task: Word-Gloss Inference, in which the model must infer a missing
word and gloss from context using varying levels of linguistic information
(e.g., glosses, grammatical explanations, translations). Our results show that
incorporating structured linguistic cues leads to consistent improvements in
reasoning performance across all models. This work highlights both the promise
and current limitations of using LLMs for typologically informed linguistic
analysis and low-resource language documentation.

Conclusion: Socratic debugging powered by LLMs is effective at generating accurate guides for addressing programming misconceptions among novices.

Abstract: In Socratic debugging, instructors guide students towards identifying and
fixing a bug on their own, instead of providing the bug fix directly. Most
novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false
beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be
formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about
the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon
reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to
first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce
the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of
debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based
solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on
them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can
generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation
turns.

### [73] [PADBen: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating AI Text Detectors Against Paraphrase Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00416)
*Yiwei Zha,Rui Min,Shanu Sushmita*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why AI-text detectors fail against iteratively-paraphrased AI-generated text, introduces a benchmark called PADBen to test vulnerabilities, and emphasizes the need for improved detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the failure of AI-generated text detectors in identifying iteratively-paraphrased AI content, which poses risks such as authorship obfuscation and plagiarism evasion.

Method: Intrinsic mechanism analysis was conducted to reveal why iterative paraphrasing escapes detection, and a benchmark called PADBen was created with specific tasks and taxonomies to evaluate detector robustness.

Result: Tests on 11 state-of-the-art detectors reveal a critical gap where detectors can identify plagiarism evasion but fail in authorship obfuscation, particularly in the intermediate laundering region.

Conclusion: Existing AI-text detection systems are insufficiently equipped to handle the nuances of intermediate laundering regions. Fundamental advancements in detection architectures are necessary.

Abstract: While AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors achieve over 90\% accuracy on direct
LLM outputs, they fail catastrophically against iteratively-paraphrased
content. We investigate why iteratively-paraphrased text -- itself AI-generated
-- evades detection systems designed for AIGT identification. Through intrinsic
mechanism analysis, we reveal that iterative paraphrasing creates an
intermediate laundering region characterized by semantic displacement with
preserved generation patterns, which brings up two attack categories:
paraphrasing human-authored text (authorship obfuscation) and paraphrasing
LLM-generated text (plagiarism evasion). To address these vulnerabilities, we
introduce PADBen, the first benchmark systematically evaluating detector
robustness against both paraphrase attack scenarios. PADBen comprises a
five-type text taxonomy capturing the full trajectory from original content to
deeply laundered text, and five progressive detection tasks across
sentence-pair and single-sentence challenges. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art
detectors, revealing critical asymmetry: detectors successfully identify the
plagiarism evasion problem but fail for the case of authorship obfuscation. Our
findings demonstrate that current detection approaches cannot effectively
handle the intermediate laundering region, necessitating fundamental advances
in detection architectures beyond existing semantic and stylistic
discrimination methods. For detailed code implementation, please see

*Naoto Iwase,Hiroki Okuyama,Junichiro Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedRECT, a benchmark for evaluating medical error handling in clinical texts through error detection, sentence extraction, and error correction in Japanese and English. Results indicate reasoning models outperform traditional ones, fine-tuning improves performance further, and the model surpasses human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe deployment of large language models in medical applications, particularly in detecting and correcting errors in clinical texts across different languages.

Method: MedRECT is developed using a scalable pipeline from Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations and its English counterpart, consisting of 663 Japanese and 458 English texts. Nine contemporary LLMs were evaluated, focusing on tasks like error detection, localization, and correction.

Result: Reasoning models surpass standard architectures in performance (up to 13.5%-error detection, 51.0%-sentence extraction improvement). Cross-lingual evaluations reveal better performance in English compared to Japanese. LoRA fine-tuning significantly improves error correction performance without compromising reasoning capabilities. Enhanced fine-tuned LLM surpasses human performance.

Conclusion: MedRECT stands as the first cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, fostering development of safer and reliable medical LLMs for diverse languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications,
but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a
prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly
beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark
(Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks:
error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error
correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the
Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English
counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with
comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning
proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning
models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5%
relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii)
cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to
Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA
fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance
(Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities;
and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured
medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first
comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a
reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across
languages.

*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,Yefeng Liu,Yun Chen,Weihua Luo,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guide-to-Generation (G2), a method to address the diversity limitations in large language models (LLMs) output without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate repetitive outputs across multiple attempts, which is a significant drawback for tasks requiring diverse and creative solutions.

Method: The proposed G2 method uses a base generator and dual Guides integrated into the decoding process to enhance the diversity of outputs without additional training.

Result: Experiments show that G2 significantly improves output diversity while achieving a balance between diversity and output quality.

Conclusion: G2 offers a training-free, effective, and quality-preserving solution to enhance output diversity in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, these models exhibit a
critical limitation in output diversity, often generating highly similar
content across multiple attempts. This limitation significantly affects tasks
requiring diverse outputs, from creative writing to reasoning. Existing
solutions, like temperature scaling, enhance diversity by modifying probability
distributions but compromise output quality. We propose Guide-to-Generation
(G2), a training-free plug-and-play method that enhances output diversity while
preserving generation quality. G2 employs a base generator alongside dual
Guides, which guide the generation process through decoding-based interventions
to encourage more diverse outputs conditioned on the original query.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that G2 effectively improves output
diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between diversity and quality.

*Ghazal Kalhor,Afra Mashhadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the fairness and bias implications of memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing outputs across co-authorship networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how LLMs, increasingly used for scholarly search and recommendation, affect fairness and bias, particularly through memorization.

Method: Three LLMs (DeepSeek R1, Llama 4 Scout, and Mixtral 8x7B) are evaluated for memorization-driven biases in co-authorship networks across disciplines and regions.

Result: The study finds a global bias favoring highly cited researchers but identifies exceptions in specific disciplines and regions, such as Clinical Medicine and parts of Africa, with more balanced representation.

Conclusion: LLMs reflect both risks and opportunities for scholarly discovery, highlighting the need for balanced training data to mitigate biases.

Abstract: Ongoing breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping search
and recommendation platforms at their core. While this shift unlocks powerful
new scientometric tools, it also exposes critical fairness and bias issues that
could erode the integrity of the information ecosystem. Additionally, as LLMs
become more integrated into web-based searches for scholarly tools, their
ability to generate summarized research work based on memorized data introduces
new dimensions to these challenges. The extent of memorization in LLMs can
impact the accuracy and fairness of the co-authorship networks they produce,
potentially reflecting and amplifying existing biases within the scientific
community and across different regions. This study critically examines the
impact of LLM memorization on the co-authorship networks. To this end, we
assess memorization effects across three prominent models, DeepSeek R1, Llama 4
Scout, and Mixtral 8x7B, analyzing how memorization-driven outputs vary across
academic disciplines and world regions. While our global analysis reveals a
consistent bias favoring highly cited researchers, this pattern is not
uniformly observed. Certain disciplines, such as Clinical Medicine, and
regions, including parts of Africa, show more balanced representation, pointing
to areas where LLM training data may reflect greater equity. These findings
underscore both the risks and opportunities in deploying LLMs for scholarly
discovery.

TL;DR: Introducing the BHEPC corpus for Bhili-Hindi-English translations with 110,000 curated sentences and evaluating machine translation models for Bhili language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of machine translation resources for underrepresented Indian tribal languages like Bhili.

Method: The paper constructed a Bhili-Hindi-English parallel corpus and evaluated multilingual LLMs using fine-tuning and in-context learning.

Result: The fine-tuned NLLB-200 model performed best in bidirectional translation tasks, demonstrating the capability of multilingual models in handling low-resource languages.

Conclusion: This study fills the resource gap for Bhili machine translation, providing benchmarks and advancing multilingual NLP technologies for marginalized languages.

Abstract: The linguistic diversity of India poses significant machine translation
challenges, especially for underrepresented tribal languages like Bhili, which
lack high-quality linguistic resources. This paper addresses the gap by
introducing Bhili-Hindi-English Parallel Corpus (BHEPC), the first and largest
parallel corpus worldwide comprising 110,000 meticulously curated sentences
across Bhili, Hindi, and English. The corpus was created with the assistance of
expert human translators. BHEPC spans critical domains such as education,
administration, and news, establishing a valuable benchmark for research in low
resource machine translation. To establish a comprehensive Bhili Machine
Translation benchmark, we evaluated a wide range of proprietary and open-source
Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs) on bidirectional translation tasks
between English/Hindi and Bhili. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the
fine-tuned NLLB-200 distilled 600M variant model outperforms others,
highlighting the potential of multilingual models in low resource scenarios.
Furthermore, we investigated the generative translation capabilities of
multilingual LLMs on BHEPC using in-context learning, assessing performance
under cross-domain generalization and quantifying distributional divergence.
This work bridges a critical resource gap and promotes inclusive natural
language processing technologies for low-resource and marginalized languages
globally.

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of dataset size on privacy-utility trade-offs in Differential Privacy text rewriting mechanisms, conducting evaluations on datasets containing up to one million texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work in Differential Privacy for NLP has overlooked the influence of dataset size on both the effectiveness and balance between utility and privacy preservation.

Method: The authors conducted utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets of varying sizes, using dynamic split sizes to analyze the effects of dataset scale on DP text rewriting mechanisms.

Result: The analysis shows that dataset size significantly influences the privacy-utility trade-offs of DP NLP mechanisms, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: Evaluations of DP NLP mechanisms must consider dataset size to improve assessment accuracy, and the findings push toward better evaluation protocols and practical applications at scale.

Abstract: Recent work in Differential Privacy with Natural Language Processing (DP NLP)
has proposed numerous promising techniques in the form of text rewriting
mechanisms. In the evaluation of these mechanisms, an often-ignored aspect is
that of dataset size, or rather, the effect of dataset size on a mechanism's
efficacy for utility and privacy preservation. In this work, we are the first
to introduce this factor in the evaluation of DP text privatization, where we
design utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets with dynamic split
sizes. We run these tests on datasets of varying size with up to one million
texts, and we focus on quantifying the effect of increasing dataset size on the
privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings reveal that dataset size plays an
integral part in evaluating DP text rewriting mechanisms; additionally, these
findings call for more rigorous evaluation procedures in DP NLP, as well as
shed light on the future of DP NLP in practice and at scale.

### [79] [ToM: Leveraging Tree-oriented MapReduce for Long-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00489)
*Jiani Guo,Zuchao Li,Jie Wu,Qianren Wang,Yun Li,Lefei Zhang,Hai Zhao,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToM, a Tree-oriented MapReduce framework, enhancing logical coherence and long-context reasoning for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing performance degradation in LLMs when reasoning over long contexts due to limited context windows and issues in existing frameworks.

Method: The proposed ToM framework employs hierarchical semantic parsing to build a 'DocTree' and utilizes a recursive Tree MapReduce approach for reasoning, with bottom-up aggregation of rationales.

Result: ToM demonstrated significant improvement in logical coherence and long-context reasoning, outperforming current frameworks and methods in experiments involving 70B+ LLMs.

Conclusion: ToM's hierarchical structure and recursive reasoning methods resolve long-context reasoning limitations effectively, offering a novel advancement in handling large documents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), constrained by limited context windows, often
face significant performance degradation when reasoning over long contexts. To
address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves and reasons over
chunks but frequently sacrifices logical coherence due to its reliance on
similarity-based rankings. Similarly, divide-and-conquer frameworks (DCF) split
documents into small chunks for independent reasoning and aggregation. While
effective for local reasoning, DCF struggles to capture long-range dependencies
and risks inducing conflicts by processing chunks in isolation. To overcome
these limitations, we propose ToM, a novel Tree-oriented MapReduce framework
for long-context reasoning. ToM leverages the inherent hierarchical structure
of long documents (e.g., main headings and subheadings) by constructing a
DocTree through hierarchical semantic parsing and performing bottom-up
aggregation. Using a Tree MapReduce approach, ToM enables recursive reasoning:
in the Map step, rationales are generated at child nodes; in the Reduce step,
these rationales are aggregated across sibling nodes to resolve conflicts or
reach consensus at parent nodes. Experimental results on 70B+ LLMs show that
ToM significantly outperforms existing divide-and-conquer frameworks and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, achieving better logical coherence and
long-context reasoning. Our code is available at

### [80] [Zero-RAG: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Zero Redundant Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00505)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Junqi Dai,Shuang Cheng,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zero-RAG optimizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by reducing external redundancy and leveraging internal large language model (LLM) knowledge, resulting in faster performance without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and redundancy in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) caused by overlap between the external corpus and large language models' (LLM) internal knowledge. This redundancy inflates retrieval costs and may adversely affect RAG performance on questions already answerable by the LLM.

Method: The authors introduce a new metric, Mastery-Score, to identify and prune redundant external knowledge in the RAG corpus. Subsequently, a Query Router and Noise-Tolerant Tuning are employed to better use the LLM's internal knowledge while managing distractions from irrelevant documents.

Result: The proposed method, Zero-RAG, reduced the Wikipedia corpus by 30% and accelerated the retrieval process by 22%, all without negatively affecting RAG's overall performance.

Conclusion: Zero-RAG demonstrates that pruning redundant external data and optimizing LLM utilization can lead to faster retrieval and efficient use of computational resources while maintaining robust RAG performance.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation has shown remarkable results to address Large
Language Models' hallucinations, which usually uses a large external corpus to
supplement knowledge to LLMs. However, with the development of LLMs, the
internal knowledge of LLMs has expanded significantly, thus causing significant
knowledge redundancy between the external corpus and LLMs. On the one hand, the
indexing cost of dense retrieval is highly related to the corpus size and thus
significant redundant knowledge intensifies the dense retrieval's workload. On
the other hand, the redundant knowledge in the external corpus is not helpful
to LLMs and our exploratory analysis shows that it instead hurts the RAG
performance on those questions which the LLM can answer by itself. To address
these issues, we propose Zero-RAG to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we
first propose the Mastery-Score metric to identify redundant knowledge in the
RAG corpus to prune it. After pruning, answers to "mastered" questions rely
primarily on internal knowledge of the LLM. To better harness the internal
capacity, we propose Query Router and Noise-Tolerant Tuning to avoid the
irrelevant documents' distraction and thus further improve the LLM's
utilization of internal knowledge with pruned corpus. Experimental results show
that Zero-RAG prunes the Wikipedia corpus by 30\% and accelerates the retrieval
stage by 22\%, without compromising RAG's performance.

TL;DR: This paper presents a fine-tuned offline conversational AI model designed to assist in healthcare delivery in rural Nepal, where internet access is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliance on internet-dependent conversational AI and improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained rural areas.

Method: The authors fine-tuned DialoGPT on a synthetic dataset featuring doctor-patient interactions for ten common diseases prevalent in rural Nepal.

Result: The model generated coherent, contextually relevant, and medically appropriate responses, showing good understanding of disease contexts and patient communication.

Conclusion: Compact offline dialogue models, combined with targeted datasets, can be effective for healthcare applications in low-resource settings, indicating potential for rural medical conversational AI.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly being explored to support healthcare
delivery, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as rural Nepal.
Large-scale conversational models typically rely on internet connectivity and
cloud infrastructure, which may not be accessible in rural areas. In this
study, we fine-tuned DialoGPT, a lightweight generative dialogue model that can
operate offline, on a synthetically constructed dataset of doctor-patient
interactions covering ten common diseases prevalent in rural Nepal, including
common cold, seasonal fever, diarrhea, typhoid fever, gastritis, food
poisoning, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Despite being
trained on a limited, domain-specific dataset, the fine-tuned model produced
coherent, contextually relevant, and medically appropriate responses,
demonstrating an understanding of symptoms, disease context, and empathetic
communication. These results highlight the adaptability of compact,
offline-capable dialogue models and the effectiveness of targeted datasets for
domain adaptation in low-resource healthcare environments, offering promising
directions for future rural medical conversational AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias in transformer-based language models and introduces a metric to measure bias while suggesting data augmentation for mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing gender bias in transformer-based language models due to their inherited biases from training data.

Method: Introduced MALoR metric to quantify gender bias and proposed mitigation via continued pre-training on gender-balanced data generated by Counterfactual Data Augmentation.

Result: Substantial reduction in gender bias across multiple models with notable decreases in bias scores for pronoun pairs without degrading model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective in reducing gender bias in contextualized word embeddings while maintaining neural model efficiency.

Abstract: Gender bias in language models has gained increasing attention in the field
of natural language processing. Encoder-based transformer models, which have
achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language tasks, have been
shown to exhibit strong gender biases inherited from their training data. This
paper investigates gender bias in contextualized word embeddings, a crucial
component of transformer-based models. We focus on prominent architectures such
as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT to examine their vulnerability to
gender bias. To quantify the degree of bias, we introduce a novel metric,
MALoR, which assesses bias based on model probabilities for filling masked
tokens. We further propose a mitigation approach involving continued
pre-training on a gender-balanced dataset generated via Counterfactual Data
Augmentation. Our experiments reveal significant reductions in gender bias
scores across different pronoun pairs. For instance, in BERT-base, bias scores
for "he-she" dropped from 1.27 to 0.08, and "his-her" from 2.51 to 0.36
following our mitigation approach. We also observed similar improvements across
other models, with "male-female" bias decreasing from 1.82 to 0.10 in
BERT-large. Our approach effectively reduces gender bias without compromising
model performance on downstream tasks.

*Wenya Xie,Shaochen,Zhong,Hoang Anh Duy Le,Zhaozhuo Xu,Jianwen Xie,Zirui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WordSaladChopper (WSC), a lightweight tool to remove useless repetitive tokens (word salad) in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), reducing token costs without compromising output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in LRMs caused by 'word salad' – continuous, redundant, and semantically void tokens – which waste decoding budgets and degrade user experience.

Method: The authors developed a simple, single-layer linear classifier to detect and remove word salad in the output of LRMs on-the-fly. They then implemented a regeneration prompt to replace removed tokens, achieving more concise results.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces output token length while preserving the semantic value and quality of the responses, demonstrating efficiency with low overhead.

Conclusion: Implementing WordSaladChopper or a similar tool is essential for improving user experience in LRM applications, as it reduces redundancy, saves costs, and maintains high reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are often bottlenecked by the high cost of
output tokens. We show that a significant portion of these tokens are useless
self-repetitions - what we call "word salad" - that exhaust the decoding budget
without adding value. Interestingly, we observe that LRMs are self-aware when
trapped in these loops: the hidden states of <\n\n> tokens trailing each
reasoning chunk exhibit patterns that allow us to detect word salad behavior
on-the-fly via a single-layer linear classifier. Once detected, a simple chop
appended by a straightforward regeneration prompt yields substantial length
savings with minimal quality loss. Our work offers WordSaladChopper (WSC) - a
lightweight, turnkey component for LRM that is minimally invasive to its
reasoning trajectory by only removing semantically redundant tokens. Given its
low overhead, strong savings, and the lack of semantic value of word salad
tokens, we believe it is not too far-fetched to argue that WSC - or a similar
component - is a must-have for all LRM applications with user experience in
mind. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces CISEA-MRFE, a sentiment analysis framework leveraging contextual instructions, semantic enhancement, and advanced feature extraction, achieving significant accuracy improvement across benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentiment analysis methods struggle with nuanced emotional cues, domain shifts, and imbalanced sentiment distributions due to inadequate semantic grounding and biases.

Method: CISEA-MRFE integrates Contextual Instruction (CI), Semantic Enhancement Augmentation (SEA), and Multi-Refined Feature Extraction (MRFE) techniques using pre-trained language models.

Result: CISEA-MRFE demonstrated accuracy improvements of up to 4.6% on IMDb, 6.5% on Yelp, 30.3% on Twitter, and 4.1% on Amazon benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: CISEA-MRFE enhances generalization and robustness for sentiment classification by effectively addressing challenges like semantic grounding and sentiment imbalances.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis using deep learning and pre-trained language models (PLMs)
has gained significant traction due to their ability to capture rich contextual
representations. However, existing approaches often underperform in scenarios
involving nuanced emotional cues, domain shifts, and imbalanced sentiment
distributions. We argue that these limitations stem from inadequate semantic
grounding, poor generalization to diverse linguistic patterns, and biases
toward dominant sentiment classes. To overcome these challenges, we propose
CISEA-MRFE, a novel PLM-based framework integrating Contextual Instruction
(CI), Semantic Enhancement Augmentation (SEA), and Multi-Refined Feature
Extraction (MRFE). CI injects domain-aware directives to guide sentiment
disambiguation; SEA improves robustness through sentiment-consistent
paraphrastic augmentation; and MRFE combines a Scale-Adaptive Depthwise Encoder
(SADE) for multi-scale feature specialization with an Emotion Evaluator Context
Encoder (EECE) for affect-aware sequence modeling. Experimental results on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that CISEA-MRFE consistently outperforms strong
baselines, achieving relative improvements in accuracy of up to 4.6% on IMDb,
6.5% on Yelp, 30.3% on Twitter, and 4.1% on Amazon. These results validate the
effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach for sentiment
classification across varied domains.

*Peng Ding,Jun Kuang,Wen Sun,Zongyu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai,Jiajun Chen,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Intent Shift Attack (ISA), a method that manipulates large language models (LLMs) by disguising harmful intents, achieving higher attack success rates and showcasing existing defense inadequacies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper lies in improving robustness and safety mechanisms for LLMs by understanding vulnerabilities in intent recognition and addressing limitations of existing attack strategies.

Method: The authors establish a taxonomy of intent transformations to create attacks that LLMs misidentify as benign. ISA modifies original requests minimally but effectively, producing natural-looking prompts with harmful hidden intent.

Result: ISA demonstrated over 70% improved attack success rates over direct harmful prompts, and achieved nearly 100% success when fine-tuned on reformulated data. Existing defense methods were found ineffective against ISA.

Conclusion: The paper highlights fundamental challenges in intent inference and the insufficiency of current defenses, emphasizing the need for improved methods. Additionally, the findings stress the need for more robust safety security measures in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks
despite their impressive capabilities. Investigating these weaknesses is
crucial for robust safety mechanisms. Existing attacks primarily distract LLMs
by introducing additional context or adversarial tokens, leaving the core
harmful intent unchanged. In this paper, we introduce ISA (Intent Shift
Attack), which obfuscates LLMs about the intent of the attacks. More
specifically, we establish a taxonomy of intent transformations and leverage
them to generate attacks that may be misperceived by LLMs as benign requests
for information. Unlike prior methods relying on complex tokens or lengthy
context, our approach only needs minimal edits to the original request, and
yields natural, human-readable, and seemingly harmless prompts. Extensive
experiments on both open-source and commercial LLMs show that ISA achieves over
70% improvement in attack success rate compared to direct harmful prompts. More
critically, fine-tuning models on only benign data reformulated with ISA
templates elevates success rates to nearly 100%. For defense, we evaluate
existing methods and demonstrate their inadequacy against ISA, while exploring
both training-free and training-based mitigation strategies. Our findings
reveal fundamental challenges in intent inference for LLMs safety and
underscore the need for more effective defenses. Our code and datasets are

TL;DR: FlashEVA significantly reduces memory and computational demands for Transformer inference, achieving up to 6.7x higher throughput and 5x lower peak GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers revolutionized NLP but face challenges in inference due to high memory demands. This paper addresses the need for more efficient attention mechanisms.

Method: FlashEVA, an efficient implementation of EVA combined with fine-tuning mechanisms, adapts Transformer models to a streamlined attention system.

Result: FlashEVA achieves substantial gains in GPU memory efficiency and inference throughput, while preserving effectiveness in most downstream tasks, excluding retrieval-focused ones.

Conclusion: FlashEVA improves Transformer efficiency and adaptability but still faces limitations in retrieval tasks, highlighting its potential for broader NLP applications.

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing, achieving
state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating remarkable scalability. However,
their memory demands, particularly due to maintaining full context in memory,
pose significant challenges for inference. In this paper, we present FlashEVA,
an efficient implementation of EVA (Efficient Attention via Control Variates),
and demonstrate how to finetune transformers to adapt to FlashEVA attention.
Our method enables fine-tuning of Transformer models with as few as 1.5B tokens
while preserving effectiveness across various downstream tasks. Notably,
FlashEVA achieves up to 6.7x higher throughput and 5x lower peak GPU memory
usage during inference compared to standard Transformer implementations.
Despite these improvements, we observe limitations in retrieval-focused tasks.
Our implementation offers control over the trade-off between throughput and
accuracy through adjustable hyperparameters, providing flexibility for diverse

*Wai-Chung Kwan,Joshua Ong Jun Leang,Pavlos Vougiouklis,Jeff Z. Pan,Marco Valentino,Pasquale Minervini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenSIR, a self-play framework for large language model reasoning without external supervision, improving mathematical problem-solving capabilities by alternating teacher-student roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods depend on annotated datasets, restricting models from surpassing human-level performance. A self-play framework offers a solution to enable open-ended learning without the need for external verifiers.

Method: OpenSIR uses a self-play framework where the LLM alternates between teacher and student roles. It generates novel problems optimized for difficulty and diversity to promote mathematical discovery.

Result: OpenSIR significantly improved performance on reasoning benchmarks like GSM8K and College Math for instruction models, showcasing notable advancements in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: OpenSIR enables autonomous progression in problem-solving from basic to advanced concepts, demonstrating the potential for open-ended mathematical exploration without external supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning through reinforcement
learning rely on annotated datasets for verifiable rewards, which may limit
models' ability to surpass human-level performance. While self-play offers a
promising alternative, existing approaches depend on external verifiers or
cannot learn open-endedly. We present Open-Ended Self-Improving Reasoner
(OpenSIR), a self-play framework where an LLM learns to generate and solve
novel problems by alternating teacher and student roles without external
supervision. To generate novel problems, OpenSIR optimises for both difficulty
and diversity, rewarding problems that challenge appropriately while exploring
distinct concepts, enabling open-ended mathematical discovery. Starting from a
single trivial seed problem, OpenSIR substantially improves instruction models:
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct advances from 73.9 to 78.3 on GSM8K, and from 28.8 to
34.4 on College Math, while Gemma-2-2B-Instruct rises from 38.5 to 58.7 on
GSM8K. Our analyses reveal that OpenSIR achieves open-ended learning through
co-evolving teacher-student roles that adaptively calibrate difficulty and
drive diverse exploration, progressing autonomously from basic to advanced
mathematics.

### [88] [SpecDiff-2: Scaling Diffusion Drafter Alignment For Faster Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00606)
*Jameson Sandler,Jacob K. Christopher,Thomas Hartvigsen,Nando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpecDiff-2, an enhanced framework for speculative decoding, leveraging discrete diffusion for parallelism and innovative calibration techniques to improve efficiency and reduce token rejections, achieving substantial speed-ups without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing speculative decoding methods for large language models which suffer from parallelism constraints during drafting and frequent token rejections.

Method: The method involves using discrete diffusion as a non-autoregressive drafter to enable parallel processing and developing calibration techniques to align the drafter and verifier models.

Result: SpecDiff-2 improves processing efficiency by achieving up to +55% improvement in tokens-per-second over existing methods and up to a 5.5x speed-up over standard decoding methods, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: SpecDiff-2 successfully addresses the fundamental bottlenecks of speculative decoding, setting a new state-of-the-art in speed and efficiency for large language model tasks across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become the standard approach for accelerating Large
Language Model (LLM) inference. It exploits a lossless draft-then-verify
procedure to circumvent the latency of autoregressive decoding, achieving
impressive speed-ups. Yet, current speculative decoding approaches remain
limited by two fundamental bottlenecks: (1) the autoregressive dependency
during drafting which limits parallelism, and (2) frequent rejections of draft
tokens caused by misalignment between the draft and verify models. This paper
proposes SpecDiff-2, a novel framework to jointly address these two
bottlenecks. It leverages discrete diffusion as a non-autoregressive drafter to
address bottleneck (1) and develops novel techniques to calibrate discrete
diffusion drafters with autoregressive verifiers, addressing bottleneck (2).
Experimental results across a comprehensive benchmark suite show that
SpecDiff-2 achieves a new state-of-the-art across reasoning, coding, and
mathematical benchmarks, improving tokens-per-second by up to an average of
+55% over previous baselines and obtaining up to 5.5x average speed-up over
standard decoding, without any loss of accuracy.

### [89] [Certain but not Probable? Differentiating Certainty from Probability in LLM Token Outputs for Probabilistic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00620)
*Autumn Toney-Wails,Ryan Wails*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models (LLMs) for tasks requiring alignment with theoretical probability distributions and finds discrepancies in model output probabilities compared to theoretical expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models in decision-based and knowledge-intensive applications requires reliable uncertainty quantification, especially in scenarios involving probabilistic reasoning.

Method: The study evaluates GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-Chat on ten probabilistic prompts (e.g., rolling a six-sided die) by comparing their response validity and alignment of token-level probabilities with theoretical probability distributions, both with and without explicit probability cues.

Result: The models achieved perfect response accuracy for all tested prompts but showed token-level probabilities and entropy values that consistently differed from the theoretical probability distributions.

Conclusion: Although the models excel at producing accurate responses in probabilistic scenarios, their uncertainty representations in terms of token-level probabilities do not align well with theoretical expectations. This indicates a limitation in current UQ methods for probabilistic tasks.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for ensuring
trustworthy downstream use of large language models, especially when they are
deployed in decision-support and other knowledge-intensive applications. Model
certainty can be estimated from token logits, with derived probability and
entropy values offering insight into performance on the prompt task. However,
this approach may be inadequate for probabilistic scenarios, where the
probabilities of token outputs are expected to align with the theoretical
probabilities of the possible outcomes. We investigate the relationship between
token certainty and alignment with theoretical probability distributions in
well-defined probabilistic scenarios. Using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-Chat, we
evaluate model responses to ten prompts involving probability (e.g., roll a
six-sided die), both with and without explicit probability cues in the prompt
(e.g., roll a fair six-sided die). We measure two dimensions: (1) response
validity with respect to scenario constraints, and (2) alignment between
token-level output probabilities and theoretical probabilities. Our results
indicate that, while both models achieve perfect in-domain response accuracy
across all prompt scenarios, their token-level probability and entropy values
consistently diverge from the corresponding theoretical distributions.

*Jean Barré,Olga Seminck,Antoine Bourgois,Thierry Poibeau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the evolution of the detective archetype in French literature using computational methods over 150 years.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the role and characteristics of the detective archetype in French literature have transformed over time.

Method: Quantitative analysis and character-level embeddings were used with a supervised model to study 150 years of French detective fiction.

Result: The study found unity in the detective archetype despite its evolution, highlighting shifts in narrative importance, moral complexity, and social themes.

Conclusion: The detective archetype transitioned from secondary roles to central figures, reflecting literary and societal changes.

Abstract: This research explores the evolution of the detective archetype in French
detective fiction through computational analysis. Using quantitative methods
and character-level embeddings, we show that a supervised model is able to
capture the unity of the detective archetype across 150 years of literature,
from M. Lecoq (1866) to Commissaire Adamsberg (2017). Building on this finding,
the study demonstrates how the detective figure evolves from a secondary
narrative role to become the central character and the "reasoning machine" of
the classical detective story. In the aftermath of the Second World War, with
the importation of the hardboiled tradition into France, the archetype becomes
more complex, navigating the genre's turn toward social violence and moral
ambiguity.

*Eshaan Tanwar,Anwoy Chatterjee,Michael Saxon,Alon Albalak,William Yang Wang,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark, XNationQA, to evaluate multilingual LLMs' cultural literacy, revealing discrepancies in handling culturally-specific facts across languages and noting limited knowledge transfer capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual question-answering benchmarks lack regional diversity and focus predominantly on Western-centric information, limiting fair evaluation of multilingual LLMs' comprehension across different cultures.

Method: The paper introduces XNationQA, a dataset of 49,280 questions about nine countries in seven languages, benchmarks eight multilingual LLMs, and uses novel transference metrics to analyze their performance.

Result: The study reveals significant discrepancies in LLMs' cultural fact accessibility across languages, showing better performance in Western languages but limited cross-lingual knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs exhibit a bias towards Western languages and insufficient cultural literacy for non-Western countries, indicating the need for more diverse benchmarking approaches.

Abstract: Most multilingual question-answering benchmarks, while covering a diverse
pool of languages, do not factor in regional diversity in the information they
capture and tend to be Western-centric. This introduces a significant gap in
fairly evaluating multilingual models' comprehension of factual information
from diverse geographical locations. To address this, we introduce XNationQA
for investigating the cultural literacy of multilingual LLMs. XNationQA
encompasses a total of 49,280 questions on the geography, culture, and history
of nine countries, presented in seven languages. We benchmark eight standard
multilingual LLMs on XNationQA and evaluate them using two novel transference
metrics. Our analyses uncover a considerable discrepancy in the models'
accessibility to culturally specific facts across languages. Notably, we often
find that a model demonstrates greater knowledge of cultural information in
English than in the dominant language of the respective culture. The models
exhibit better performance in Western languages, although this does not
necessarily translate to being more literate for Western countries, which is
counterintuitive. Furthermore, we observe that models have a very limited
ability to transfer knowledge across languages, particularly evident in
open-source models.

*Berk Atil,Rebecca J. Passonneau,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates multilingual jailbreaks and defenses in LLMs across ten languages using two attack types, revealing variations in safety and the need for cross-lingual safety benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in understanding how well jailbreak attacks and defenses generalize across languages for large language models.

Method: Systematic evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages using six LLMs on HarmBench and AdvBench, assessing logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based attacks.

Result: Finds that attack success and defense robustness vary by language, with high-resource languages being safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones.

Conclusion: Calls for developing language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for improving the safety of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment after training and
tuning, yet recent work shows that safety can be bypassed through jailbreak
attacks. While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual
generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic
multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten
languages--spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages--using six LLMs
on HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types:
logical-expression-based and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack
success and defense robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages
are safer under standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones.
Simple defenses can be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These
findings call for language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.

### [93] [Optimizing Native Sparse Attention with Latent Attention and Local Global Alternating Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00819)
*Yuxuan Hu,Jianchao Tan,Jiaqi Zhang,Wen Zan,Pingwei Sun,Yifan Lu,Yerui Sun,Yuchen Xie,Xunliang Cai,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enhances Native Sparse Attention (NSA) with new techniques improving long-context modeling and reducing memory usage during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing NSA in propagating long-range dependencies efficiently and enhancing long-sequence task performance.

Method: Alternating between local and global attention across layers to improve dependency propagation, introducing Latent Attention mechanisms (MLA and GLA) to reduce memory requirements while boosting performance.

Result: Achieved reduced KV-cache memory usage by 50% with enhanced common-sense reasoning and long-text understanding capabilities, tested on models ranging from 340M to 1.3B parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms conventional NSA and full attention approaches in reasoning and long-context tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) and propose targeted improvements that enhance long-context modeling. A
key insight is that alternating between local (sliding-window) and global
(compression, selective) attention across layers, rather than using fixed
patterns, enables more effective propagation of long-range dependencies and
substantially boosts performance on long-sequence tasks. Meanwhile, we further
refine NSA's branches with Latent Attention that the sliding-window branch is
enhanced with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) while compression and selective
branches adopt Group-head Latent Attention (GLA). These changes reduce KV-cache
memory by 50\% versus NSA while improving the model's common-sense reasoning
and long-text understanding capabilities. Experiments on models from 340M to
1.3B parameters (trained on 15B and 100B tokens) show our method matches or
exceeds full attention and native sparse attention in both common-sense
reasoning and long-context understanding tasks.

*Chong Lyu,Lin Li,Shiqing Wu,Jingling Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models can propagate social biases; this paper proposes TriCon-Fair, a contrastive learning framework to reduce bias while preserving language modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing debiasing methods that inadvertently cause residual social bias due to biased and unbiased samples being treated independently, leading to coupling issues.

Method: Propose TriCon-Fair, integrating triplet loss and language modeling objectives to decouple biased-negative and unbiased-positive sample relationships while maintaining general language model capabilities.

Result: Experimental results show TriCon-Fair successfully reduces discriminatory outputs more effectively than existing baselines while preserving downstream application performance.

Conclusion: TriCon-Fair provides a novel, ethical, and practical solution to mitigate social bias in NLP models without compromising their performance.

Abstract: The increasing utilization of large language models raises significant
concerns about the propagation of social biases, which may result in harmful
and unfair outcomes. However, existing debiasing methods treat the biased and
unbiased samples independently, thus ignoring their mutual relationship. This
oversight enables a hidden negative-positive coupling, where improvements for
one group inadvertently compromise the other, allowing residual social bias to
persist. In this paper, we introduce TriCon-Fair, a contrastive learning
framework that employs a decoupled loss that combines triplet and language
modeling terms to eliminate positive-negative coupling. Our TriCon-Fair assigns
each anchor an explicitly biased negative and an unbiased positive, decoupling
the push-pull dynamics and avoiding positive-negative coupling, and jointly
optimizes a language modeling (LM) objective to preserve general capability.
Experimental results demonstrate that TriCon-Fair reduces discriminatory output
beyond existing debiasing baselines while maintaining strong downstream
performance. This suggests that our proposed TriCon-Fair offers a practical and
ethical solution for sensitive NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning accuracy by grounding steps in essential knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure step-by-step reasoning by LLMs is grounded in accurate and essential knowledge.

Method: Developed an evaluation suite with three tools: a repository of atomic knowledge, knowledge-grounded metrics for reasoning evaluation, and an evaluator LLM for reliable computations.

Result: The framework effectively identifies flaws in reasoning, such as missing or misapplied knowledge, and aids LLM optimization.

Conclusion: Knowledge-grounded evaluation significantly improves reasoning analysis and enhances LLM performance beyond just evaluation.

Abstract: Step-by-step reasoning has become a standard approach for large language
models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks. While this paradigm has proven
effective, it raises a fundamental question: How can we verify that an LLM's
reasoning is accurately grounded in knowledge? To address this question, we
introduce a novel evaluation suite that systematically assesses the knowledge
grounding of intermediate reasoning. Our framework comprises three key
components. (1) Principal Knowledge Collection, a large-scale repository of
atomic knowledge essential for reasoning. Based on the collection, we propose
(2) knowledge-grounded evaluation metrics designed to measure how well models
recall and apply prerequisite knowledge in reasoning. These metrics are
computed by our (3) evaluator LLM, a lightweight model optimized for
cost-effective and reliable metric computation. Our evaluation suite
demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in identifying missing or misapplied
knowledge elements, providing crucial insights for uncovering fundamental
reasoning deficiencies in LLMs. Beyond evaluation, we demonstrate how these
metrics can be integrated into preference optimization, showcasing further
applications of knowledge-grounded evaluation.

TL;DR: ColMate enhances multimodal document retrieval using OCR-based pretraining, masked contrastive learning, and tailored scoring mechanisms, achieving notable improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal document retrieval often rely on text-only retrieval approaches, limiting performance due to inadequate handling of multimodal structures and characteristics.

Method: ColMate integrates an OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism specifically designed for multimodal document structures.

Result: The ColMate model improves retrieval accuracy by 3.61% on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark and generalizes effectively to out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: ColMate bridges the gap between multimodal representation learning and document retrieval, outperforming current models and providing stronger generalization on benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has proven practical when models require
specialized knowledge or access to the latest data. However, existing methods
for multimodal document retrieval often replicate techniques developed for
text-only retrieval, whether in how they encode documents, define training
objectives, or compute similarity scores. To address these limitations, we
present ColMate, a document retrieval model that bridges the gap between
multimodal representation learning and document retrieval. ColMate utilizes a
novel OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive
learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism more relevant to
multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. ColMate obtains
3.61% improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark,
demonstrating stronger generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates two leading large language models (LLMs) in medical diagnostic scenarios for understandability and empathy, showing limitations in generating equitable and accessible communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in providing understandable and empathetic explanations for clinicians in medical diagnostic scenarios.

Method: The research used readability metrics to evaluate understandability and LLM-as-a-Judge ratings to measure empathy, alongside human evaluations.

Result: LLMs adjust explanations considering socio-demographics and patient conditions, but they tend to create overly complex content with biased empathy.

Conclusion: Systematic calibration is necessary for LLMs to ensure equitable and accessible communication in medical scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinicians in
diagnostic communication by generating explanations and guidance for patients.
Yet their ability to produce outputs that are both understandable and
empathetic remains uncertain. We evaluate two leading LLMs on medical
diagnostic scenarios, assessing understandability using readability metrics as
a proxy and empathy through LLM-as-a-Judge ratings compared to human
evaluations. The results indicate that LLMs adapt explanations to
socio-demographic variables and patient conditions. However, they also generate
overly complex content and display biased affective empathy, leading to uneven
accessibility and support. These patterns underscore the need for systematic
calibration to ensure equitable patient communication. The code and data are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the reasoning and self-assessment capabilities of five large language models (LLMs) across seven major Indian languages using a multilingual riddle dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how well LLMs can perform culturally grounded reasoning in non-English languages, specifically focusing on Indian languages.

Method: The research involves creating a multilingual riddle dataset and evaluating five LLMs across seven Indian languages using seven prompting strategies in two stages: riddle-solving and self-evaluation experiments.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best overall in riddle-solving but shows low self-assessment accuracy. Lower-performing models like LLaMA 4 Scout demonstrate higher self-awareness, highlighting gaps in multilingual reasoning.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for LLMs capable of both effective reasoning and recognizing their own limitations across diverse linguistic contexts.

Abstract: The extent to which large language models (LLMs) can perform culturally
grounded reasoning across non-English languages remains underexplored. This
paper examines the reasoning and self-assessment abilities of LLMs across seven
major Indian languages-Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and
Telugu. We introduce a multilingual riddle dataset combining traditional
riddles with context-reconstructed variants and evaluate five LLMs-Gemini 2.5
Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral-Saba, LLaMA 4 Scout, and LLaMA 4 Maverick-under
seven prompting strategies. In the first stage, we assess riddle-solving
performance and find that while Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best overall, few-shot
methods yield only marginal gains, and accuracy varies notably across
languages. In the second stage, we conduct a self-evaluation experiment to
measure reasoning consistency. The results reveal a key finding: a model's
initial accuracy is inversely correlated with its ability to identify its own
mistakes. Top-performing models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro are overconfident (4.34%
True Negative Rate), whereas lower-performing models like LLaMA 4 Scout are
substantially more self-aware (42.09% True Negative Rate). These results point
to clear gaps in multilingual reasoning and highlight the need for models that
not only reason effectively but also recognize their own limitations.

*Chenwang Wu,Yiu-ming Cheung,Bo Han,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Existing methods assume perfect labels for machine-generated text detection, which is flawed. This study proposes an 'easy-to-hard' enhancement framework to address label ambiguity and improve detection robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training paradigms assume 'golden standard' labels for machine-generated text detection, but these labels often involve ambiguity and errors due to human limitations and detector superintelligence.

Method: The proposed framework uses an 'easy supervisor' targeting simpler detection tasks on longer texts. It structurally integrates the detector with the supervisor to mitigate the impact of ambiguous labels, optimize detection, and approximate ideal labels.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved detection performance in various challenging conditions like cross-LLM, cross-domain, mixed text, and paraphrase attacks.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances detection reliability despite learning under ambiguous conditions, suggesting its potential as a robust and practical solution.

Abstract: Existing machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods implicitly assume
labels as the "golden standard". However, we reveal boundary ambiguity in MGT
detection, implying that traditional training paradigms are inexact. Moreover,
limitations of human cognition and the superintelligence of detectors make
inexact learning widespread and inevitable. To this end, we propose an
easy-to-hard enhancement framework to provide reliable supervision under such
inexact conditions. Distinct from knowledge distillation, our framework employs
an easy supervisor targeting relatively simple longer-text detection tasks
(despite weaker capabilities), to enhance the more challenging target detector.
Firstly, longer texts targeted by supervisors theoretically alleviate the
impact of inexact labels, laying the foundation for reliable supervision.
Secondly, by structurally incorporating the detector into the supervisor, we
theoretically model the supervisor as a lower performance bound for the
detector. Thus, optimizing the supervisor indirectly optimizes the detector,
ultimately approximating the underlying "golden" labels. Extensive experiments
across diverse practical scenarios, including cross-LLM, cross-domain, mixed
text, and paraphrase attacks, demonstrate the framework's significant detection
effectiveness. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARS-SQL, a multi-agent framework for generating accurate SQL queries using reinforcement learning and generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language translation to SQL is challenging for complex queries requiring interaction and self-correction.

Method: MARS-SQL employs three agents: a Grounding Agent for schema linking, a Generation Agent leveraging Reinforcement Learning for iterative query formation, and a Validation Agent for selecting the best trajectory based on generative modeling.

Result: State-of-the-art execution accuracy was achieved with 77.84% on the BIRD dev set and 89.75% on the Spider test set.

Conclusion: MARS-SQL's structured multi-agent approach and interactive reinforcement learning demonstrate a significant advancement in robust SQL query generation.

Abstract: Translating natural language to SQL remains difficult for complex queries.
Such queries often need environmental interaction and self-correction. To
address this, we introduce MARS-SQL, a novel multi-agent framework that
combines principled task decomposition and interactive reinforcement learning
(RL). Our system comprises three specialized agents: a Grounding Agent for
schema linking, a Generation Agent for query generation, and a Validation Agent
for final selection. The core of our framework is the Generation agent, which
is trained via a multi-turn RL policy. Adopting a ReAct-style Think-Act-Observe
loop, the agent iteratively generates thoughts, executes SQL actions against a
live database, and revises its strategy based on execution feedback, enabling
dynamic, stateful reasoning and self-correction. At inference time, we generate
multiple interaction trajectories to explore diverse reasoning paths. The
Validation agent, then selects the optimal trajectory by modeling verification
as a next-token prediction task and choosing the solution with the highest
generation probability. This structured workflow pipelines specialized agents.
It combines interactive RL for generation with generative modeling for
verification. The approach proves highly effective for robust and accurate SQL
generation. Experiments show that MARS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art Execution
Accuracy of 77.84% on the BIRD dev set and 89.75% on the Spider test set. Our
code is available at https://github.com/YangHaolin0526/MARS-SQL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces IF-CRITIC, a model aimed at efficiently evaluating and optimizing instruction-following ability in Large Language Models (LLMs) with scalable rewards and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation models for instruction-following in LLMs are costly and unreliable, prompting the need for an efficient and accurate assessment mechanism.

Method: The authors propose IF-CRITIC, which includes a checklist generator to decompose instructions, a multi-stage critique filtering mechanism for reliable data collection, and constraint-level preference optimization for training.

Result: Experiments show IF-CRITIC outperforms existing LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, like Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini, in evaluation accuracy and allows for improved optimization of LLMs under reduced computational requirements.

Conclusion: IF-CRITIC offers a reliable and efficient solution for assessing and enhancing instruction-following in LLMs, outperforming previous methods and optimizing models with lower overhead.

Abstract: Instruction following is a fundamental ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring their generated outputs to follow multiple constraints
imposed in input instructions. Numerous studies have attempted to enhance this
ability through preference optimization or reinforcement learning based on
reward signals from LLM-as-a-Judge. However, existing evaluation models for
instruction following still possess many deficiencies, such as substantial
costs and unreliable assessments. To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM
critic that can provide efficient and reliable assessments of constraint
following in the instructions. We first develop a checklist generator to
decompose instructions and generate constraint checklists. With the assistance
of the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a
multi-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level
preference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong
LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini. With the scalable
reward signals provided by IF-CRITIC, LLMs can achieve substantial performance
gains in instruction-following optimization under lower computational overhead
compared to strong LLM critic baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often struggle to create effective prompts for large language models (LLMs), hindering their performance on complex problems.

Method: The researchers developed Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning approach. It engages small-scale LLMs to generate prompts for large-scale LLMs in a multi-turn interactive process using dual-constrained rewards for correctness, quality, and reasoning.

Result: Prompt-R1 was tested across multiple public datasets and achieved significant performance improvements over baseline models.

Conclusion: Prompt-R1 effectively enhances the interaction between small and large-scale LLMs, providing better problem-solving capabilities, and offers a flexible, publicly available framework.

Abstract: Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an
increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users
are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with
LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a
small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user
interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a
multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates
prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained
reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and
reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports
both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on
multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline
models across tasks. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: OceanAI is a conversational AI platform integrating large language models with real-time authoritative NOAA data, enhancing precision, transparency, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucinations from general AI systems and improve scientific reliability in oceanographic conversation platforms.

Method: OceanAI queries NOAA data streams in real-time using API calls to provide reproducible responses and visualizations, grounded in authoritative datasets.

Result: OceanAI uniquely provided accurate and referenced NOAA data in blind tests, outperforming other AI systems which either refused to respond or gave incorrect answers.

Conclusion: OceanAI demonstrates potential as a scalable solution to enhance decision-making in ocean sciences through transparent and trustworthy AI interactions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming the sciences, yet general
conversational AI systems often generate unverified "hallucinations"
undermining scientific rigor. We present OceanAI, a conversational platform
that integrates the natural-language fluency of open-source large language
models (LLMs) with real-time, parameterized access to authoritative
oceanographic data streams hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). Each query such as "What was Boston Harbor's highest
water level in 2024?" triggers real-time API calls that identify, parse, and
synthesize relevant datasets into reproducible natural-language responses and
data visualizations. In a blind comparison with three widely used AI
chat-interface products, only OceanAI produced NOAA-sourced values with
original data references; others either declined to answer or provided
unsupported results. Designed for extensibility, OceanAI connects to multiple
NOAA data products and variables, supporting applications in marine hazard
forecasting, ecosystem assessment, and water-quality monitoring. By grounding
outputs and verifiable observations, OceanAI advances transparency,
reproducibility, and trust, offering a scalable framework for AI-enabled
decision support within the oceans. A public demonstration is available at

TL;DR: The paper investigates Romanian-language datasets, compares them to English data, and introduces a lightweight multitask model for filtering datasets to enhance LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the scarcity of high-quality corpora for under-represented languages like Romanian and improving their LLM training performance.

Method: They trained a multitask model on Romanian texts annotated by LLMs and used multi-level filtering techniques (educational value, topic, format) to curate high-quality datasets.

Result: The study identifies notable trends in Romanian and English data topics and demonstrates that filtering improves pretraining performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Filtering annotated Romanian texts enhances dataset quality and LLM pretraining results, showing the importance of curated corpora for under-represented languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently exploded in popularity, often
matching or outperforming human abilities on many tasks. One of the key factors
in training LLMs is the availability and curation of high-quality data. Data
quality is especially crucial for under-represented languages, where
high-quality corpora are scarce. In this work we study the characteristics and
coverage of Romanian pretraining corpora and we examine how they differ from
English data. By training a lightweight multitask model on carefully
LLM-annotated Romanian texts, we are able to analyze and perform multi-level
filtering (e.g., educational value, topic, format) to generate high-quality
pretraining datasets. Our experiments show noteworthy trends in the topics
present in Romanian and English data, while also proving the effectiveness of
filtering data through improved LLM pretraining performance across multiple
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automating remediation of faulty microservice systems without requiring human-crafted prompts from Site Reliability Engineers.

Method: Developing MicroRemed benchmark for evaluating LLMs and proposing ThinkRemed framework, which utilizes iterative reasoning and system reflection for remediation.

Result: MicroRemed revealed significant challenges for current LLMs, while ThinkRemed demonstrated improved performance in autonomous microservice remediation.

Conclusion: The integration of reflective reasoning frameworks like ThinkRemed shows promise in enhancing the autonomy and effectiveness of LLM-based microservice remediation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with agent-based reasoning frameworks
have recently shown strong potential for autonomous decision-making and
system-level operations. One promising yet underexplored direction is
microservice remediation, where the goal is to automatically recover faulty
microservice systems. Existing approaches, however, still rely on human-crafted
prompts from Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), with LLMs merely converting
textual instructions into executable code. To advance research in this area, we
introduce MicroRemed, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in end-to-end
microservice remediation, where models must directly generate executable
Ansible playbooks from diagnosis reports to restore system functionality. We
further propose ThinkRemed, a multi-agent framework that emulates the
reflective and perceptive reasoning of SREs. Experimental results show that
MicroRemed presents substantial challenges to current LLMs, while ThinkRemed
improves end-to-end remediation performance through iterative reasoning and
system reflection. The benchmark is available at

*Marek Strong,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TSVer, a dataset designed for verifying factual claims by reasoning over temporal and numerical data, providing insights into challenges faced by state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for fact-checking struggle with structured evidence, both in terms of quality and justification, focusing heavily on synthetic claims. This limits the evaluation of systems handling temporal and numerical reasoning data.

Method: The authors curated TSVer by sourcing 287 real-world claims from 38 fact-checking organizations and combining them with a database of 400 diverse time series. Annotation was enhanced using an LLM-assisted multi-step process to ensure high quality with an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745.

Result: TSVer challenges state-of-the-art reasoning models (like Gemini-2.5-Pro), which still struggle with this dataset, achieving modest accuracy and justifications scores (63.37 accuracy and 48.63 Ev2R).

Conclusion: TSVer serves as a critical benchmark for advancing models in temporal and numerical reasoning, demonstrating gaps in current model capabilities and motivating future research.

Abstract: Reasoning over temporal and numerical data, such as time series, is a crucial
aspect of fact-checking. While many systems have recently been developed to
handle this form of evidence, their evaluation remains limited by existing
datasets, which often lack structured evidence, provide insufficient
justifications for verdicts, or rely on synthetic claims. In this paper, we
introduce TSVer, a new benchmark dataset for fact verification focusing on
temporal and numerical reasoning with time-series evidence. TSVer contains 287
real-world claims sourced from 38 fact-checking organizations and a curated
database of 400 time series covering diverse domains. Each claim is annotated
with time frames across all pertinent time series, along with a verdict and
justifications reflecting how the evidence is used to reach the verdict. Using
an LLM-assisted multi-step annotation process, we improve the quality of our
annotations and achieve an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745 on
verdicts. We also develop a baseline for verifying claims against time-series
evidence and show that even the state-of-the-art reasoning models like
Gemini-2.5-Pro are challenged by time series, achieving a 63.37 accuracy score
on verdicts and an Ev2R score of 48.63 on verdict justifications.

*Emaad Manzoor,Eva Ascarza,Oded Netzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies salespeople's quitting decisions during outbound sales interactions and proposes an AI-based solution to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how salespeople decide to quit conversations and whether these decisions are efficient, with the goal of improving sales processes.

Method: The paper formulates the quitting decision as an optimal stopping problem and develops a language model-based agent that mimics an inferred optimal decision policy using text-based cues.

Result: The AI agent reduces time spent on failed calls by 54%, preserves sales, and reallocates saved time to increase expected sales by up to 37%.

Conclusion: AI algorithms can significantly enhance the efficiency of outbound sales by correcting human errors in quitting decisions influenced by cognitive biases.

Abstract: Salespeople frequently face the dynamic screening decision of whether to
persist in a conversation or abandon it to pursue the next lead. Yet, little is
known about how these decisions are made, whether they are efficient, or how to
improve them. We study these decisions in the context of high-volume outbound
sales where leads are ample, but time is scarce and failure is common. We
formalize the dynamic screening decision as an optimal stopping problem and
develop a generative language model-based sequential decision agent - a
stopping agent - that learns whether and when to quit conversations by
imitating a retrospectively-inferred optimal stopping policy. Our approach
handles high-dimensional textual states, scales to large language models, and
works with both open-source and proprietary language models. When applied to
calls from a large European telecommunications firm, our stopping agent reduces
the time spent on failed calls by 54% while preserving nearly all sales;
reallocating the time saved increases expected sales by up to 37%. Upon
examining the linguistic cues that drive salespeople's quitting decisions, we
find that they tend to overweight a few salient expressions of consumer
disinterest and mispredict call failure risk, suggesting cognitive bounds on
their ability to make real-time conversational decisions. Our findings
highlight the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to correct
cognitively-bounded human decisions and improve salesforce efficiency.

*Muhammed Saeed,Muhammad Abdul-mageed,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces DebateBias-8K, a benchmark to assess narrative biases in multilingual generative language models across sensitive domains and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective bias evaluation methods in generative contexts, especially in multilingual and realistic settings.

Method: The authors developed DebateBias-8K, a benchmark testing four flagship LLMs with 8,400 structured debate prompts in various sensitive domains and languages. They automatically classify over 100,000 responses to analyze biases.

Result: Results indicate entrenched biases in all four models, especially in low-resource languages, despite safety alignment efforts. Examples include stereotypes linking Arabs to terrorism and Africans to socioeconomic backwardness.

Conclusion: Bias mitigation methods primarily trained in English fail to generalize globally. DebateBias-8K serves to advance future bias evaluations and promote inclusive model alignment approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed for open-ended
communication, yet most bias evaluations still rely on English,
classification-style tasks. We introduce DebateBias-8K, a new multilingual,
debate-style benchmark designed to reveal how narrative bias appears in
realistic generative settings. Our dataset includes 8,400 structured debate
prompts spanning four sensitive domains: women's rights, socioeconomic
development, terrorism, and religion, across seven languages ranging from
high-resource (English, Chinese) to low-resource (Swahili, Nigerian Pidgin).
Using four flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek, and LLaMA 3), we
generate and automatically classify over 100,000 responses. Results show that
all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are
overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (>=95%), Africans to
socioeconomic "backwardness" (up to <=77%), and Western groups are consistently
framed as modern or progressive. Biases grow sharply in lower-resource
languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not
generalize globally. Our findings highlight a persistent divide in multilingual
fairness: current alignment methods reduce explicit toxicity but fail to
prevent biased outputs in open-ended contexts. We release our DebateBias-8K
benchmark and analysis framework to support the next generation of multilingual
bias evaluation and safer, culturally inclusive model alignment.

*Lvhua Wu,Xuefeng Jiang,Sheng Sun,Tian Wen,Yuwei Wang,Min Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ZoFia, a framework for zero-shot fake news detection that enhances reliability by combining hierarchical salience-based keyword selection and a multi-LLM collaborative analysis system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issues that large language models face in identifying fake news, particularly their limited adaptability to fast-evolving news topics and their tendency to generate hallucinated content.

Method: ZoFia is a two-stage framework: it quantifies the importance of news entities using Hierarchical Salience and selects diverse keywords for external evidence retrieval with the SC-MMR algorithm, followed by a multi-LLM system that analyzes and debates using multiple viewpoints to make robust decisions.

Result: Experiments conducted on two public datasets show that ZoFia achieves superior performance compared to existing zero-shot baselines and most few-shot methods.

Conclusion: ZoFia effectively tackles the challenges of fake news detection by leveraging dynamic evidence retrieval and collaborative LLM-based analysis. The framework is a step forward and its open-source code will support further advancements.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news threatens social stability and public trust,
rendering its detection an imperative research priority. Although large
language models (LLMs) excel at numerous natural language processing tasks with
their remarkable contextual understanding and extensive prior knowledge, the
time-bounded knowledge coverage and tendency for generating hallucination
content reduce their reliability when handling fast-evolving news streams.
Furthermore, models trained on existing static datasets also often lack the
generalization needed for emerging news topics. To address these challenges, we
propose ZoFia, a novel two-stage zero-shot fake news detection framework.
First, we introduce Hierarchical Salience to quantify the importance of
entities in the news content, and propose the SC-MMR algorithm to effectively
select an informative and diverse set of keywords that serve as queries for
retrieving up-to-date external evidence. Subsequently, a multi LLM interactive
system, in which each agent assumes a distinct role, performs multi-view
collaborative analysis and adversarial debate over the news text and its
related information, and finally produces an interpretable and robust judgment.
Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ZoFia
obviously outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and most of few-shot
methods. Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related communities.

*Ru Wang,Wei Huang,Qi Cao,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo,Jiaxian Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-Harmony introduces a novel pseudo-labeling method for test-time reinforcement learning that achieves state-of-the-art results by relying on stability between original and reframed questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time reinforcement learning methods suffer from instability, as standard approaches like majority voting often favor spurious answers instead of correct ones.

Method: Self-Harmony employs a single model to act as both a Solver and Reframer, using harmonic mean aggregation across answers from original and rephrased inputs to select stable solutions without human supervision.

Result: Self-Harmony ranks first in 28 out of 30 test-time reinforcement learning benchmarks, achieving high accuracy and robustness with no training failures.

Conclusion: This framework enhances reliability and stability in label-free test-time adaptation, paving the way for more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) offers a label-free paradigm for
adapting models using only synthetic signals at inference, but its success
hinges on constructing reliable learning signals. Standard approaches such as
majority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce
Self-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer
should remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase.
Self-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two
complementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the
input. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of
majority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and
reframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally
selects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap
of favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human
supervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks,
Self-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time
setting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods. Beyond
accuracy, it demonstrates unprecedented robustness, with zero training failures
in all experiments, underscoring its stability and reliability.

*Guoxin Ma,Xiaoming Liu,Zhanhan Zhang,Chengzhengxu Li,Shengchao Liu,Yu Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of detecting machine-generated text using a novel two-stage DEER architecture to improve accuracy, especially under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the detection of machine-generated text, which struggles under domain shifts, as existing methods perform poorly in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: Introduced the DEER architecture with domain-specific experts for localized distinctions and shared experts for transferable features, complemented by reinforcement learning-based routing.

Result: Achieved notable performance improvements with average F1-score gains of 1.39% (in-domain) and 5.32% (out-of-domain), and accuracy gains of 1.35% (in-domain) and 3.61% (out-of-domain).

Conclusion: The DEER approach leverages disentangled expert specialization and adaptive routing mechanisms to successfully enhance machine-generated text detection under domain uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) has emerged as a critical challenge,
driven by the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) capable of
producing highly realistic, human-like content. However, the performance of
current approaches often degrades significantly under domain shift. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel framework designed to capture both
domain-specific and domain-general MGT patterns through a two-stage
Disentangled mixturE-of-ExpeRts (DEER) architecture. First, we introduce a
disentangled mixture-of-experts module, in which domain-specific experts learn
fine-grained, domain-local distinctions between human and machine-generated
text, while shared experts extract transferable, cross-domain features. Second,
to mitigate the practical limitation of unavailable domain labels during
inference, we design a reinforcement learning-based routing mechanism that
dynamically selects the appropriate experts for each input instance,
effectively bridging the train-inference gap caused by domain uncertainty.
Extensive experiments on five in-domain and five out-of-domain benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving average F1-score improvements of 1.39% and 5.32% on
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets respectively, along with accuracy gains of
1.35% and 3.61% respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical
contributions of both disentangled expert specialization and adaptive routing
to model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the role of domain specificity in improving abstractive summarization of Arabic financial texts.

Method: Created AraFinNews dataset and used transformer-based models (mT5, AraT5, FinAraT5) to evaluate their summarization performance.

Result: Domain-adapted models produced more accurate and coherent summaries, especially for numerical and entity information.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation enhances summarization quality, ensuring better factual and narrative accuracy in Arabic financial texts.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of domain specificity on abstractive
summarisation of Arabic financial texts using large language models (LLMs). We
introduce AraFinNews, the largest publicly available Arabic financial news
dataset to date, comprising 212,500 article--headline pairs spanning nearly a
decade of reporting from October 2015 to July 2025. Designed as the Arabic
equivalent of major English summarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail,
AraFinNews provides a robust benchmark for evaluating domain-specific language
understanding and generation in financial contexts. Using this resource, we
evaluate transformer-based models -- including mT5, AraT5, and the
domain-adapted FinAraT5 -- to examine how financial-domain pretraining
influences factual accuracy, numerical reliability, and stylistic alignment
with professional reporting. Experimental results show that domain-adapted
models generate more faithful and coherent summaries, particularly in handling
quantitative and entity-centric information. The findings highlight the
importance of domain-specific adaptation for improving factual consistency and
narrative fluency in Arabic financial summarisation. The dataset is freely
available for non-commercial research at

*Min Fang,Zhihui Fu,Qibin Zhao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSpec is a new framework for speculative decoding that improves speed and quality over existing methods like EAGLE-2 and SAM-Decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of speculative decoding for large language model inference by addressing the limitations of current methods.

Method: ReSpec introduces adaptive decision-making with three key innovations: an entropy-guided adaptive trigger, feedback-driven candidate selection, and a source-aware relaxed verification strategy.

Result: ReSpec achieves state-of-the-art acceleration in speculative decoding, surpassing EAGLE-2 by over 33% and SAM-Decoding by over 25% in terms of speedup.

Conclusion: ReSpec provides a significant advancement in speculative decoding by combining contextual adaptability, feedback utilization, and source-awareness to maximize both efficiency and output quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as an effective technique to accelerate
large language model (LLM) inference without compromising output quality.
However, the achievable speedup largely depends on the effectiveness of the
drafting model. While model-based methods like EAGLE-2 are accurate but costly,
retrieval-enhanced methods like SAM-Decoding rely on heuristic switching
strategies that often trigger unnecessary retrievals. To address this, we
propose ReSpec (\textbf{Re}trieval-enhanced \textbf{Spe}culative Decoding), a
novel framework that transforms heuristic drafter switching into adaptive
decision-making. ReSpec features three core innovations: 1) An
\textbf{entropy-guided adaptive trigger} quantifies contextual predictability
to initiate retrieval only when uncertainty is low, avoiding costly low-quality
speculations. 2) A \textbf{feedback-driven candidate selection} leverages
historical feedback to organize multiple high-quality candidates for parallel
verification, maximizing retrieval utility. 3) A source-aware \textbf{relaxed
verification strategy} applies strict checks to model-generated drafts while
using a relaxed verification for retrieved drafts, achieving a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench
demonstrate that ReSpec achieves state-of-the-art acceleration,outperforming
EAGLE-2 and SAM-Decoding by over $33\%$ and $25\%$, respectively, while

### [117] ["Give a Positive Review Only": An Early Investigation Into In-Paper Prompt Injection Attacks and Defenses for AI Reviewers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01287)
*Qin Zhou,Zhexin Zhang,Zhi Li,Limin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the emerging threat of hidden prompt injections designed to manipulate AI reviewers into giving overly favorable evaluations of scientific papers. It introduces two types of attacks, evaluates their performance, and discusses detection-based countermeasures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the increasing use of AI models in reviewing scientific papers and the emerging threat of adversarial prompt injections to manipulate review outcomes.

Method: Researchers proposed two types of attacks: static attacks with fixed prompts and iterative attacks optimized against simulated reviewer models. They also tested a detection-based defense mechanism.

Result: Both types of attacks showed high effectiveness, often leading to favorable full evaluation scores from AI reviewers. The detection defense reduced attack success but wasn't fully unbeaten by adaptive attackers.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerability of AI-assisted peer review systems to prompt-injection threats and emphasizes the need for further safeguarding measures.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI models, their deployment across diverse
tasks has become increasingly widespread. A notable emerging application is
leveraging AI models to assist in reviewing scientific papers. However, recent
reports have revealed that some papers contain hidden, injected prompts
designed to manipulate AI reviewers into providing overly favorable
evaluations. In this work, we present an early systematic investigation into
this emerging threat. We propose two classes of attacks: (1) static attack,
which employs a fixed injection prompt, and (2) iterative attack, which
optimizes the injection prompt against a simulated reviewer model to maximize
its effectiveness. Both attacks achieve striking performance, frequently
inducing full evaluation scores when targeting frontier AI reviewers.
Furthermore, we show that these attacks are robust across various settings. To
counter this threat, we explore a simple detection-based defense. While it
substantially reduces the attack success rate, we demonstrate that an adaptive
attacker can partially circumvent this defense. Our findings underscore the
need for greater attention and rigorous safeguards against prompt-injection
threats in AI-assisted peer review.

*Saiyma Sittul Muna,Rezwan Islam Salvi,Mushfiqur Rahman Mushfique,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FirstAidQA, a synthetic dataset of 5,500 question-answer pairs designed for emergency response applications and seeks to enable lightweight and offline-capable AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in emergency response systems where current LLMs are unsuitable for low-connectivity environments and resource-constrained devices.

Method: A domain-specific dataset was created using ChatGPT-4o-mini for in-context learning, followed by text preprocessing and human validation for accuracy and relevance.

Result: The authors developed FirstAidQA, a publicly available dataset tailored to instruct-tuning and fine-tuning lightweight LLMs and SLMs for emergency-response scenarios.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a foundation for enhancing AI systems in time-critical, safety-sensitive emergency settings, aiming to support practical and efficient solutions for first aid responders.

Abstract: In emergency situations, every second counts. The deployment of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in time-sensitive, low or zero-connectivity environments
remains limited. Current models are computationally intensive and unsuitable
for low-tier devices often used by first responders or civilians. A major
barrier to developing lightweight, domain-specific solutions is the lack of
high-quality datasets tailored to first aid and emergency response. To address
this gap, we introduce FirstAidQA, a synthetic dataset containing 5,500
high-quality question answer pairs that encompass a wide range of first aid and
emergency response scenarios. The dataset was generated using a Large Language
Model, ChatGPT-4o-mini, with prompt-based in-context learning, using texts from
the Vital First Aid Book (2019). We applied preprocessing steps such as text
cleaning, contextual chunking, and filtering, followed by human validation to
ensure accuracy, safety, and practical relevance of the QA pairs. FirstAidQA is
designed to support instruction-tuning and fine-tuning of LLMs and Small
Language Models (SLMs), enabling faster, more reliable, and offline-capable
systems for emergency settings. We publicly release the dataset to advance
research on safety-critical and resource-constrained AI applications in first
aid and emergency response. The dataset is available on Hugging Face at

*Aman Ganapathy Manvattira,Yifei Xu,Ziyue Dang,Songwu Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSpecs improves the handling of 5G standards queries by enhancing existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks through structural and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with resolving cross-references and reasoning about the evolving nature of 5G standards.

Method: DeepSpecs integrates three specialized databases and employs explicit metadata-aware methods to resolve cross-references and track specification evolution.

Result: DeepSpecs outperforms base models and telecom RAG systems, validated through two curated datasets and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Modeling structural and temporal aspects of 5G standards significantly enhances answer quality in expert-level queries.

Abstract: 5G technology enables mobile Internet access for billions of users. Answering
expert-level questions about 5G specifications requires navigating thousands of
pages of cross-referenced standards that evolve across releases. Existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, including telecom-specific
approaches, rely on semantic similarity and cannot reliably resolve
cross-references or reason about specification evolution. We present DeepSpecs,
a RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three
metadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB
(line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents).
DeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving
referenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution
by mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design
rationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world
questions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350
evolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across
multiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art
telecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution
and evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality,
underscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G
standards.

### [120] [DEEPAMBIGQA: Ambiguous Multi-hop Questions for Benchmarking LLM Answer Completeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01323)
*Jiabao Ji,Min Li,Priyanshu Kumar,Shiyu Chang,Saloni Potdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses limitations in large language models for complex question answering and introduces a new dataset, DeepAmbigQA, focusing on tasks requiring name ambiguity resolution and multi-step reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' struggles in answering complex questions involving both name ambiguity and multi-step reasoning, challenges which are not systematically evaluated by existing benchmarks.

Method: The authors created DeepAmbigQAGen, a pipeline that generates QA tasks grounded in text and knowledge graphs, systematically embedding ambiguity and reasoning challenges. They developed a dataset of 3,600 questions, DeepAmbigQA.

Result: Even GPT-5 performed poorly on this dataset, achieving low exact matches (0.13 for ambiguous and 0.21 for non-ambiguous questions), showing current LLM limitations in generating complete answers.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of developing QA systems that better handle ambiguity and multi-step reasoning for information gathering and answer completeness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with integrated search tools show strong promise
in open-domain question answering (QA), yet they often struggle to produce
complete answer set to complex questions such as Which actor from the film Heat
won at least one Academy Award?, which requires (1) distinguishing between
multiple films sharing the same title and (2) reasoning across a large set of
actors to gather and integrate evidence. Existing QA benchmarks rarely evaluate
both challenges jointly. To address this, we introduce DeepAmbigQAGen, an
automatic data generation pipeline that constructs QA tasks grounded in text
corpora and linked knowledge graph, generating natural and verifiable questions
that systematically embed name ambiguity and multi-step reasoning. Based on
this, we build DeepAmbigQA, a dataset of 3,600 questions requiring multi-hop
reasoning and half of them explicit name ambiguity resolving. Experiments
reveal that, even state-of-the-art GPT-5 show incomplete answers, achieving
only 0.13 exact match on ambiguous questions and 0.21 on non-ambiguous
questions. These findings highlight the need for more robust QA systems aimed
at information gathering and answer completeness.

*Wenrui Cai,Chengyu Wang,Junbing Yan,Jun Huang,Xiangzhong Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DistilQwen model family, consisting of four series tailored for industrial requirements, focusing on reasoning performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for small and efficient reasoning models for real-world applications has driven the development of knowledge distillation techniques.

Method: The paper presents four model series derived from Qwen models: slow-thinking models for high accuracy, adaptive-thinking models for diverse scenarios, and distilled reward models for reinforcement learning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations reveal high efficiency and strong reasoning performance, showcasing practical utility on the Alibaba Cloud PAI platform.

Conclusion: The DistilQwen models balance performance and efficiency, meeting industrial requirements and demonstrating scalability in training and inference on the Alibaba platform.

Abstract: Recently, the demand for small and efficient reasoning models to support
real-world applications has driven the development of knowledge distillation
techniques that balance reasoning performance and inference speed. In this
paper, we further extend the DistilQwen model family, initialized from the Qwen
models, by introducing four model series specifically designed to meet
industrial requirements. The distilled model collection comprises: (1)
slow-thinking models, optimized for reasoning tasks that require high accuracy;
(2) two series of adaptive-thinking models, which dynamically adjust reasoning
strategies based on input tasks to maximize efficiency across diverse
scenarios; and (3) distilled reward models, which enable further reinforcement
learning of reasoning models using distilled knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate both high inference
efficiency and strong reasoning performance for these models, as well as the
practical utility of distilled reward models. We further show that these models
support industry practitioners by providing scalable training and inference
functionalities on the Alibaba Cloud PAI (Platform for Artificial Intelligence)
platform.

*Sapir Harary,Eran Hirsch,Aviv Slobodkin,David Wan,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops MiniTruePrefixes, a model for detecting factual inconsistencies in text prefixes during NLI tasks, and shows its effectiveness in improving text generation faithfulness in summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the factuality and faithfulness of outputs from large language models during autoregressive generation, where current NLI models are limited to handling complete sentences.

Method: They introduce a prefix-level entailment detection task to enable entailment checks on dynamic text prefixes during decoding. They provide relevant datasets, train MiniTruePrefixes for this task, and integrate it into controlled decoding workflows.

Result: MiniTruePrefixes achieves 5-14 F1 points improvement over baseline NLI models in prefix-level entailment detection. Its integration into decoding significantly enhances the factual consistency of summaries while optimizing memory usage in LLaMA models.

Conclusion: The proposed MiniTruePrefixes model improves factual consistency in autoregressive text generation and bridges the gap between efficient and faithful summary generation, benefiting tasks reliant on factual fidelity.

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have been used in various ways to
improve the factuality of LLM outputs. This is typically done by applying an
NLI model to judge whether the model output is entailed from the supposed
evidence, triggering some corrective actions, such as beam reranking at
inference time or RL rewards during training. While NLI models are trained to
detect factual inconsistencies over complete sentences, decisions in the common
autoregressive generation architecture are made for each evolving text prefix,
during decoding. Addressing this setting, we generalize the entailment
detection task to apply over arbitrary text prefixes, and suggest its utility
for improving generation faithfulness. Providing suitable evaluation and
training datasets for this task, we train MiniTruePrefixes, a novel specialized
model that better detects factual inconsistencies over text prefixes,
outperforming comparable baseline NLI models by 5-14 F1 points in prefix-level
entailment. We further demonstrate that integrating MiniTruePrefixes into a
controlled decoding framework substantially improves factual consistency in
abstractive summarization. When guided by MiniTruePrefixes,
LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct matches the faithfulness and runtime of the 8B model from
the same model family, while using only half the memory.

*Aadi Palnitkar,Arjun Suresh,Rishi Rajesh,Puneet Puli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cancer-Myth-Indic, a multilingual benchmark evaluating large language models (LLMs) for healthcare responses in five Indic languages, focusing on cancer-related false presuppositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in multilingual evaluation of LLMs, especially for healthcare-related queries, as existing benchmarks are mainly in English and do not address under-served languages.

Method: The authors created Cancer-Myth-Indic by translating a 500-item subset of an English benchmark, Cancer-Myth, into five Indic languages, ensuring preservation of implicit presuppositions. Native speakers followed a structured style guide during translations.

Result: The paper provides an evaluation of popular LLMs using Cancer-Myth-Indic, highlighting their performance under the stress of false presuppositions in multilingual settings.

Conclusion: This research advances LLM evaluation in underrepresented languages, aiding in accurate assessment of multilingual healthcare advice capabilities, and emphasizing the importance of linguistic inclusivity.

Abstract: Increasingly, more and more people are turning to large language models
(LLMs) for healthcare advice and consultation, making it important to gauge the
efficacy and accuracy of the responses of LLMs to such queries. While there are
pre-existing medical benchmarks literature which seeks to accomplish this very
task, these benchmarks are almost universally in English, which has led to a
notable gap in existing literature pertaining to multilingual LLM evaluation.
Within this work, we seek to aid in addressing this gap with Cancer-Myth-Indic,
an Indic language benchmark built by translating a 500-item subset of
Cancer-Myth, sampled evenly across its original categories, into five
under-served but widely used languages from the subcontinent (500 per language;
2,500 translated items total). Native-speaker translators followed a style
guide for preserving implicit presuppositions in translation; items feature
false presuppositions relating to cancer. We evaluate several popular LLMs
under this presupposition stress.

*İbrahim Ethem Deveci,Duygu Ataman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the rise and challenges of benchmarks used to assess reasoning abilities in LLMs and LRMs, presenting a study on model performance trends and offering insights for future evaluation standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations and saturation of current benchmarks used to evaluate reasoning capabilities of LLMs and LRMs, questioning whether these benchmarks effectively assess true reasoning ability.

Method: The authors investigate reasoning capabilities by analyzing trends across benchmarks for three major model families (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and discuss their evolution over the years.

Result: The investigation highlights the saturation of benchmarks and explores trends in reasoning tasks, revealing both capabilities and challenges associated with accurately evaluating models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that surpassing benchmarks does not necessarily equate to reasoning ability, suggesting the need for more robust evaluation methods to compare LLMs and LRMs effectively.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) has been accompanied by an equally rapid increase of benchmarks used to
assess them. However, due to both improved model competence resulting from
scaling and novel training advances as well as likely many of these datasets
being included in pre or post training data, results become saturated, driving
a continuous need for new and more challenging replacements. In this paper, we
discuss whether surpassing a benchmark truly demonstrates reasoning ability or
are we simply tracking numbers divorced from the capabilities we claim to
measure? We present an investigation focused on three model families, OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google, and how their reasoning capabilities across different
benchmarks evolve over the years. We also analyze performance trends over the
years across different reasoning tasks and discuss the current situation of
benchmarking and remaining challenges. By offering a comprehensive overview of
benchmarks and reasoning tasks, our work aims to serve as a first reference to
ground future research in reasoning evaluation and model development.

### [125] [Confounding Factors in Relating Model Performance to Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01380)
*Wessel Poelman,Thomas Bauwens,Miryam de Lhoneux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how morphological differences in languages affect tokenization and language modeling and addresses confounding factors in previous research setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and clarify the conflicting evidence on the influence of language morphology on model tokenization and performance.

Method: The authors analyze previously proposed hypotheses about modeling agglutinative languages, identify confounding factors, and introduce token bigram metrics to predict language modeling difficulty.

Result: Token bigram metrics are proposed as gradient proxies for morphological complexity, which eliminate the need for expert annotation while predicting challenges in causal language modeling.

Conclusion: Better methodologies and intrinsic metrics are crucial to understanding the relationship between language morphology and language modeling.

Abstract: The extent to which individual language characteristics influence
tokenization and language modeling is an open question. Differences in
morphological systems have been suggested as both unimportant and crucial to
consider (Cotterell et al., 2018; Gerz et al., 2018a; Park et al., 2021, inter
alia). We argue this conflicting evidence is due to confounding factors in
experimental setups, making it hard to compare results and draw conclusions. We
identify confounding factors in analyses trying to answer the question of
whether, and how, morphology relates to language modeling. Next, we re-assess
three hypotheses by Arnett & Bergen (2025) for why modeling agglutinative
languages results in higher perplexities than fusional languages: they look at
morphological alignment of tokenization, tokenization efficiency, and dataset
size. We show that each conclusion includes confounding factors. Finally, we
introduce token bigram metrics as an intrinsic way to predict the difficulty of
causal language modeling, and find that they are gradient proxies for
morphological complexity that do not require expert annotation. Ultimately, we
outline necessities to reliably answer whether, and how, morphology relates to
language modeling.

### [126] [RAGSmith: A Framework for Finding the Optimal Composition of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Methods Across Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01386)
*Muhammed Yusuf Kartal,Suha Kagan Kose,Korhan Sevinç,Burak Aktas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'RAGSmith,' a framework optimizing end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures by exploring 46,080 configurations through genetic search. It achieves up to 12.5% gains in retrieval and 7.5% in generation across domains like Math, Law, and Medicine relative to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the difficulty in optimizing RAG systems as individual component-focused approaches often produce brittle results. It seeks to holistically optimize RAG pipelines for better performance across diverse tasks and domains.

Method: RAGSmith applies a genetic search over nine technique families and 46,080 feasible configurations, optimizing a scalar objective combining retrieval metrics (e.g., recall@k, mAP) with generation metrics (e.g., semantic similarity). Evaluation occurs on six Wikipedia-based domains using modular design and cross-domain testing.

Result: RAGSmith outperforms baseline RAG pipelines by +3.8% on average, with peak retrieval (12.5%) and generation gains (7.5%) dependent on question types and domain specificity. It also identifies a robust backbone architecture combining vector retrieval and reflection/revision with context-specific enhancements.

Conclusion: The framework delivers practical guidance for constructing highly effective RAG systems tailored to specific domains and tasks, showcasing the power of evolutionary search to optimize entire pipelines. It validates that modular and end-to-end optimization yields domain-aware and robust improvements.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) quality depends on many interacting
choices across retrieval, ranking, augmentation, prompting, and generation, so
optimizing modules in isolation is brittle. We introduce RAGSmith, a modular
framework that treats RAG design as an end-to-end architecture search over nine
technique families and 46{,}080 feasible pipeline configurations. A genetic
search optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics
(recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic
similarity). We evaluate on six Wikipedia-derived domains (Mathematics, Law,
Finance, Medicine, Defense Industry, Computer Science), each with 100 questions
spanning factual, interpretation, and long-answer types. RAGSmith finds
configurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\% on
average (range +1.2\% to +6.9\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\% in
retrieval and +7.5\% in generation. The search typically explores $\approx
0.2\%$ of the space ($\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone --
vector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by
domain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt
reordering; passage compression is never selected. Improvement magnitude
correlates with question type, with larger gains on factual/long-answer mixes
than interpretation-heavy sets. These results provide practical, domain-aware
guidance for assembling effective RAG systems and demonstrate the utility of
evolutionary search for full-pipeline optimization.

*Heng Zhou,Ao Yu,Yuchen Fan,Jianing Shi,Li Kang,Hejia Geng,Yongting Zhang,Yutao Fan,Yuhao Wu,Tiancheng He,Yiran Qin,Lei Bai,Zhenfei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiveSearchBench, a pipeline for creating benchmarks that test large language models' (LLMs) ability to retrieve and reason using recent updates to world knowledge instead of relying solely on static memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on question answering often favor memorization and do not account for the dynamic nature of world knowledge or retrieval, which limits comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The authors propose LiveSearchBench, a completely automated pipeline that extracts updated knowledge deltas from successive Wikidata snapshots, filters for quality, and generates natural-language questions validated through SPARQL at three reasoning difficulty levels.

Result: Experiments reveal a significant drop in LLM performance on knowledge facts acquired post-pretraining, especially on multi-hop queries. Retrieval-augmented methods and larger models offer partial improvements but cannot fully mitigate this performance gap.

Conclusion: LiveSearchBench shifts the focus of LLM evaluation towards tasks emphasizing real-time retrieval and reasoning, providing a robust method for tracking and assessing their effectiveness in handling evolving knowledge environments.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on question answering often relies on
static benchmarks that reward memorization and understate the role of
retrieval, failing to capture the dynamic nature of world knowledge. We present
LiveSearchBench, an automated pipeline for constructing retrieval-dependent
benchmarks from recent knowledge updates. Our method computes deltas between
successive Wikidata snapshots, filters candidate triples for quality, and
synthesizes natural-language questions at three levels of reasoning difficulty,
each guaranteed to admit a unique, verifiable answer through SPARQL validation.
The pipeline is fully automated, scalable across time, and minimizes human
intervention, enabling continual regeneration of temporally grounded
benchmarks. Experiments show a pronounced performance drop when models confront
facts that post-date pretraining, with the gap most salient on multi-hop
queries. Retrieval augmented methods and larger, instruction-tuned models
provide partial gains but fail to close this recency gap. By design,
LiveSearchBench shifts evaluation from static memorization toward tasks that
require up-to-date retrieval and reasoning, offering a foundation for
systematic, long-term assessment of LLMs under evolving knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a draft-based refinement pipeline for translating low-resource languages like Latin, achieving results comparable to proprietary systems using open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by translating a morphology-rich and low-resource language like Latin, and to develop an open-source solution comparable to top-tier proprietary systems.

Method: The method involves using a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model for draft translation, followed by refining it with zero-shot LLMs (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3). It is enhanced by utilizing retrieved augmented context (RAG) examples.

Result: The system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline on both in-domain (Rosenthal, 2023) and out-of-domain (12th-century Latin letters, 2025) benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: A reproducible open-source pipeline is presented for Latin translation, providing benchmarks and resources to encourage replication and further research, demonstrating the efficiency of the approach in handling niche languages.

Abstract: Translating a morphology-rich, low-resource language like Latin poses
significant challenges. This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based
refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a
performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our
method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality,
structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes
this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context
with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of
this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set
(Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of
12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source
RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline,
without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the
Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability
and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Budget-Aware Reasoning Distillation (BARD) is introduced to optimize reasoning efficiency in small language models by allowing control over reasoning length within computational budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in resource usage caused by redundant reasoning in Chain-of-Thought distillation for smaller language models.

Method: BARD employs a two-phase training regimen: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on data compressed to different budget levels and 2) Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize reasoning performance under budget constraints.

Result: BARD enables an 8B student model to perform well on reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA) while maintaining adaptive reasoning length across varying budgets.

Conclusion: BARD effectively transfers reasoning capabilities to smaller models and provides fine-grained control over computational efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: While long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation effectively transfers
reasoning capability to smaller language models, the reasoning process often
remains redundant and computational budget uncontrollable, leading to
inefficient resource usage. To address this limitation, we propose
\textbf{Budget-Aware Reasoning Distillation (BARD)}, a novel framework that
simultaneously distills reasoning capability and enables fine-grained control
over the reasoning length. BARD uses the thinking budget as a user-specified
control signal, allowing the model to dynamically balance reasoning performance
and computational efficiency. To achieve this concept, BARD introduces a
two-phase training regimen. The first phase, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
teacher-generated long CoT data compressed to various budget levels,
bootstrapping the model's understanding of budget constraints. The second phase
leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) from a reward signal in consideration of
reasoning performance and budget fidelity simultaneously. Incorporating the
two-phase regimen is crucial to avoiding policy degradation and ensuring that
both objectives are optimized jointly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method empowers an 8B student model to achieve strong performance on
challenging reasoning benchmarks (\textit{AIME24, AIME25, GPQA}) while
providing precise and adaptive control over its reasoning length across a wide
range of budgets.

*Alexander Okupnik,Johannes Schneider,Kyriakos Flouris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interactive model for creative human-AI dance interaction using motion capture (MoCap) data. It uniquely combines motion inpainting and motion style transfer, enhancing responsiveness to human movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore creative and embodied human-AI interactions through dance, leveraging the expressive and interactive potential of motion capture data.

Method: The model uses single-person motion data and high-level features, applying diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to generate temporally coherent and diverse movement based on incoming motion sequences.

Result: The generated dance movements are shown to be diverse, realistic, and responsive, demonstrating successful feature distribution convergence with test data.

Conclusion: The study represents a foundational step toward creative AI systems that can interact with humans through dance, paving the way for more expressive human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent success with large language models has sparked a new wave of verbal
human-AI interaction. While such models support users in a variety of creative
tasks, they lack the embodied nature of human interaction. Dance, as a primal
form of human expression, is predestined to complement this experience. To
explore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an
interactive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data. It generates an
artificial other by partially mimicking and also "creatively" enhancing an
incoming sequence of movement data. It is the first model, which leverages
single-person motion data and high level features in order to do so and, thus,
it does not rely on low level human-human interaction data. It combines ideas
of two diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to
generate movement representations that are both temporally coherent and
responsive to a chosen movement reference. The success of the model is
demonstrated by quantitatively assessing the convergence of the feature
distribution of the generated samples and the test set which serves as
simulating the human performer. We show that our generations are first steps to
creative dancing with AI as they are both diverse showing various deviations
from the human partner while appearing realistic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coral reefs play a critical role in marine ecosystems but face threats from environmental changes, calling for improved monitoring solutions.

Method: The study compares three machine learning models (ResNet, ViT, CNN) on a diverse coral dataset, employing hyperparameter tuning to find the best performing model.

Result: CNN achieved the highest accuracy (88%) in classifying coral bleaching, surpassing other models.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the efficiency of CNN in coral reef monitoring and highlight its potential for autonomous environmental applications.

Abstract: Coral reefs support numerous marine organisms and are an important source of
coastal protection from storms and floods, representing a major part of marine
ecosystems. However coral reefs face increasing threats from pollution, ocean
acidification, and sea temperature anomalies, making efficient protection and
monitoring heavily urgent. Therefore, this study presents a novel
machine-learning-based coral bleaching classification system based on a diverse
global dataset with samples of healthy and bleached corals under varying
environmental conditions, including deep seas, marshes, and coastal zones. We
benchmarked and compared three state-of-the-art models: Residual Neural Network
(ResNet), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
After comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, the CNN model achieved the highest
accuracy of 88%, outperforming existing benchmarks. Our findings offer
important insights into autonomous coral monitoring and present a comprehensive
analysis of the most widely used computer vision models.

*Hanyang Chen,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing representation learning by informing data augmentation and selection with mutual information from real-world distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve representation learning and reduce reliance on human-designed data augmentation and selection, aiming for more effective/robust generalization in open environments.

Method: Proposes selecting training data based on mutual information from real-world distributions, particularly choosing patches most robust under natural perturbations, and applying them with a contrastive loss.

Result: Demonstrates and validates the method's effectiveness by testing it across multiple state-of-the-art frameworks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mutual-information-informed data augmentation is an effective technique for representation learning and is a promising future research direction.

Abstract: Representation learning methods utilizing the InfoNCE loss have demonstrated
considerable capacity in reducing human annotation effort by training invariant
neural feature extractors. Although different variants of the training
objective adhere to the information maximization principle between the data and
learned features, data selection and augmentation still rely on human
hypotheses or engineering, which may be suboptimal. For instance, data
augmentation in contrastive learning primarily focuses on color jittering,
aiming to emulate real-world illumination changes. In this work, we investigate
the potential of selecting training data based on their mutual information
computed from real-world distributions, which, in principle, should endow the
learned features with better generalization when applied in open environments.
Specifically, we consider patches attached to scenes that exhibit high mutual
information under natural perturbations, such as color changes and motion, as
positive samples for learning with contrastive loss. We evaluate the proposed
mutual-information-informed data augmentation method on several benchmarks
across multiple state-of-the-art representation learning frameworks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and establishing it as a promising direction
for future research.

*Rupjyoti Chutia,Dibya Jyoti Bora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates various denoising methods paired with CLAHE for rice leaf image enhancement, aiming to improve analysis reliability in agricultural applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve image-processing reliability for rice leaf analysis, enabling better disease detection, nutrient deficiency evaluation, and growth analysis.

Method: A comparative study of well-known denoising methods integrated with CLAHE. Experiments were conducted on rice leaf image datasets, evaluated using various metrics.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the combined methods (denoising and CLAHE) in effectively enhancing rice leaf images, producing reliable data for agricultural research.

Conclusion: The findings provide a robust foundation for evaluating digital image-processing techniques and insights for future adaptations in agricultural and other domains.

Abstract: Digital image processing involves the systematic handling of images using
advanced computer algorithms, and has gained significant attention in both
academic and practical fields. Image enhancement is a crucial preprocessing
stage in the image-processing chain, improving image quality and emphasizing
features. This makes subsequent tasks (segmentation, feature extraction,
classification) more reliable. Image enhancement is essential for rice leaf
analysis, aiding in disease detection, nutrient deficiency evaluation, and
growth analysis. Denoising followed by contrast enhancement are the primary
steps. Image filters, generally employed for denoising, transform or enhance
visual characteristics like brightness, contrast, and sharpness, playing a
crucial role in improving overall image quality and enabling the extraction of
useful information. This work provides an extensive comparative study of
well-known image-denoising methods combined with CLAHE (Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for efficient denoising of rice leaf images.
The experiments were performed on a rice leaf image dataset to ensure the data
is relevant and representative. Results were examined using various metrics to
comprehensively test enhancement methods. This approach provides a strong basis
for assessing the effectiveness of methodologies in digital image processing
and reveals insights useful for future adaptation in agricultural research and
other domains.

### [136] [Which LiDAR scanning pattern is better for roadside perception: Repetitive or Non-repetitive?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00060)
*Zhiqi Qi,Runxin Zhao,Hanyang Zhuang,Chunxiang Wang,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of different LiDAR scanning patterns (repetitive vs. non-repetitive) on roadside perception through a novel benchmark dataset and analyzes their performance implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored impact of different LiDAR scanning modes on perceptual performance in roadside infrastructure settings, enabling better understanding and optimization of ITS applications.

Method: The study introduces the 'InfraLiDARs' Benchmark dataset collected using mixed LiDAR systems in CARLA simulations, analyzes scanning modes statistically, and evaluates their role in 3D object detection algorithms.

Result: The study reveals comparable detection performance between non-repetitive and 128-line repetitive LiDAR systems, with non-repetitive LiDAR offering cost-effective benefits despite its limited range.

Conclusion: The findings guide optimal LiDAR scanning mode selection and compatible algorithms for roadside applications, promoting efficient and cost-effective roadside perception setups. The 'InfraLiDARs' Benchmark is publicly shared to encourage future research.

Abstract: LiDAR-based roadside perception is a cornerstone of advanced Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS). While considerable research has addressed optimal
LiDAR placement for infrastructure, the profound impact of differing LiDAR
scanning patterns on perceptual performance remains comparatively
under-investigated. The inherent nature of various scanning modes - such as
traditional repetitive (mechanical/solid-state) versus emerging non-repetitive
(e.g. prism-based) systems - leads to distinct point cloud distributions at
varying distances, critically dictating the efficacy of object detection and
overall environmental understanding. To systematically investigate these
differences in infrastructure-based contexts, we introduce the "InfraLiDARs'
Benchmark," a novel dataset meticulously collected in the CARLA simulation
environment using concurrently operating infrastructure-based LiDARs exhibiting
both scanning paradigms. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive
statistical analysis of the respective LiDAR scanning abilities and evaluate
the impact of these distinct patterns on the performance of various leading 3D
object detection algorithms. Our findings reveal that non-repetitive scanning
LiDAR and the 128-line repetitive LiDAR were found to exhibit comparable
detection performance across various scenarios. Despite non-repetitive LiDAR's
limited perception range, it's a cost-effective option considering its low
price. Ultimately, this study provides insights for setting up roadside
perception system with optimal LiDAR scanning patterns and compatible
algorithms for diverse roadside applications, and publicly releases the
"InfraLiDARs' Benchmark" dataset to foster further research.

Motivation: To develop robust tools for world simulation, synthetic data generation, and evaluation in robotics and autonomous systems while lowering barriers for innovation in Physical AI.

Method: Combines a flow-based architecture with a vision-language model [Cosmos-Reason1], uses a 200M video dataset and reinforcement learning for training, and introduces control-net like style for translation.

Result: Improvements in video quality, instruction alignment, and robust video generation with smaller models achieving better performance.

Conclusion: [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and [Cosmos-Transfer2.5] establish themselves as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence, with open-source resources released to accelerate research.

Abstract: We introduce [Cosmos-Predict2.5], the latest generation of the Cosmos World

[Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation
in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language

Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement
learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial
improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment,
with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more
reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop
simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family
with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and
Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than
[Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video
generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and
[Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To

*Harald Kristen,Daniel Kulmer,Manuela Hirschmugl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning-based method for detecting changes in alpine habitats using geospatial foundation models and multimodal data in Gesaeuse National Park, Austria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mapping of alpine ecosystems at a high temporal resolution is costly and ineffective for monitoring rapid climate change and disturbances.

Method: The study applies deep learning models (Prithvi-EO-2.0, Clay v1.0) for post-classification change detection and ChangeViT transformer for direct change detection. It compares these approaches using high-resolution multimodal data (RGB, NIR, LiDAR, terrain attributes) for habitat change analysis.

Result: Clay v1.0 outperformed U-Net in multi-class habitat change accuracy (51% vs. 41%) and binary change detection (67% both). Direct change detection with ChangeViT showed higher IoU performance for binary change (0.53 vs. 0.35), but lower accuracy (28%) for multi-class detection. LiDAR integration improved semantic segmentation accuracy from 30% to 50%.

Conclusion: The results reflect realistic performance levels in complex alpine ecosystems, with geospatial foundation models demonstrating robustness. Future improvements involve object-based processing and physical constraints to enhance utility.

Abstract: Rapid climate change and other disturbances in alpine ecosystems demand
frequent habitat monitoring, yet manual mapping remains prohibitively expensive
for the required temporal resolution. We employ deep learning for change
detection using long-term alpine habitat data from Gesaeuse National Park,
Austria, addressing a major gap in applying geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
to complex natural environments with fuzzy class boundaries and highly
imbalanced classes. We compare two paradigms: post-classification change
detection (CD) versus direct CD. For post-classification CD, we evaluate GFMs
Prithvi-EO-2.0 and Clay v1.0 against U-Net CNNs; for direct CD, we test the
transformer ChangeViT against U-Net baselines. Using high-resolution multimodal
data (RGB, NIR, LiDAR, terrain attributes) covering 4,480 documented changes
over 15.3 km2, results show Clay v1.0 achieves 51% overall accuracy versus
U-Net's 41% for multi-class habitat change, while both reach 67% for binary
change detection. Direct CD yields superior IoU (0.53 vs 0.35) for binary but
only 28% accuracy for multi-class detection. Cross-temporal evaluation reveals
GFM robustness, with Clay maintaining 33% accuracy on 2020 data versus U-Net's
23%. Integrating LiDAR improves semantic segmentation from 30% to 50% accuracy.
Although overall accuracies are lower than in more homogeneous landscapes, they
reflect realistic performance for complex alpine habitats. Future work will
integrate object-based post-processing and physical constraints to enhance
applicability.

*Huanlin Gao,Ping Chen,Fuyuan Shi,Chao Tan,Zhaoxiang Liu,Fang Zhao,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeMiCa is a framework for accelerating diffusion-based video generation, achieving both faster inference and higher quality outputs without substantial perceptual degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing caching strategies in video generation often lead to global content degradation due to error accumulation, requiring a refined approach for better quality and consistency.

Method: LeMiCa introduces Lexicographic Minimax Path Optimization to bound worst-case path error by modeling cache scheduling as a directed graph with error-weighted edges.

Result: The framework achieves dual improvement with a 2.9x inference speedup on the Latte model and an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming earlier caching methods.

Conclusion: LeMiCa provides a robust and generalizable strategy for enhancing diffusion-based video synthesis, ensuring minimal perceptual quality loss while enabling accelerated performance.

Abstract: We present LeMiCa, a training-free and efficient acceleration framework for
diffusion-based video generation. While existing caching strategies primarily
focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation
of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated
and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a
directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax
Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error.
This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and
style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video
benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference
speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on
the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming
prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual
quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for
accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can
serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable
video synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLD, an innovative framework for improving large vision-language-action (VLA) models through reinforcement learning and optimized data collection, achieving impressive results across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in VLA models, especially its dependency on expensive human demonstrations, to enhance scalability and generalization.

Method: The method involves a three-stage framework: (1) training residual actors to identify failure regions in VLA models, (2) using hybrid rollout schemes to gather deployment-aligned and recovery-focused data, and (3) distilling this data back into the generalist using SFT.

Result: Using the PLD framework, the authors achieved near-perfect success rates across various benchmarks such as LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real-world robot manipulation tasks while enhancing the model's performance in unfamiliar scenarios.

Conclusion: The study concludes that residual probing and distribution-aware data collection are crucial for scalable, self-improving VLA models, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become the de facto post-training strategy
for large vision-language-action (VLA) models, but its reliance on costly human
demonstrations limits scalability and generalization. We propose Probe, Learn,
Distill (PLD), a three-stage plug-and-play framework that improves VLAs through
residual reinforcement learning (RL) and distribution-aware data collection. In
Stage 1, we train lightweight residual actors to probe failure regions of the
VLA generalist. In Stage 2, we use a hybrid rollout scheme that aligns
collected trajectories with the generalist's deployment distribution while
capturing recovery behaviors. In Stage 3, we distill the curated trajectories
back into the generalist with standard SFT. PLD achieves near-saturated 99%
task success on LIBERO, over 50% gains in SimplerEnv, and 100% success on
real-world Franka and YAM arm manipulation tasks. Ablations show that residual
probing and distribution-aware replay are key to collecting deployment-aligned
data that improves both seen and unseen tasks, offering a scalable path toward
self-improving VLA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpinalSAM-R1, a system combining advanced segmentation models for CT imaging of the spine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in spine CT segmentation due to low contrast and complex boundaries.

Method: Proposes SpinalSAM-R1, integrating SAM and DeepSeek-R1 with anatomy-guided attention and semantics-driven protocols.

Result: SpinalSAM-R1 achieves high segmentation accuracy, supported by interactive software with quick response times.

Conclusion: The system offers efficient and accurate spine CT image segmentation and is made available publicly for further use.

Abstract: The anatomical structure segmentation of the spine and adjacent structures
from computed tomography (CT) images is a key step for spinal disease diagnosis
and treatment. However, the segmentation of CT images is impeded by low
contrast and complex vertebral boundaries. Although advanced models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in various segmentation tasks,
their performance in spinal CT imaging is limited by high annotation
requirements and poor domain adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose SpinalSAM-R1, a multimodal vision-language interactive system that
integrates a fine-tuned SAM with DeepSeek-R1, for spine CT image segmentation.
Specifically, our SpinalSAM-R1 introduces an anatomy-guided attention mechanism
to improve spine segmentation performance, and a semantics-driven interaction
protocol powered by DeepSeek-R1, enabling natural language-guided refinement.
The SpinalSAM-R1 is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient
adaptation. We validate our SpinalSAM-R1 on the spine anatomical structure with
CT images. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves superior
segmentation performance. Meanwhile, we develop a PyQt5-based interactive
software, which supports point, box, and text-based prompts. The system
supports 11 clinical operations with 94.3\% parsing accuracy and sub-800 ms
response times. The software is released on

*Nils Porsche,Flurin Müller-Diesing,Sweta Banerjee,Miguel Goncalves,Marc Aubreville*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using self-supervised learning (SSL) with CLE for improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging, highlighting a proposed video filter method for training optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLE images are challenging for non-experienced physicians to interpret due to the complexity of patterns and shortage of labeled datasets correlated with histopathology.

Method: The study proposes a filter functionality for CLE video sequences to reduce redundancy and improve SSL training efficiency and convergence in medical imaging tasks. Multiple networks were used, including SSL teacher-student methods with vision transformers.

Result: Filtered SSL-pretrained models achieved better test accuracy (67.48% and 73.52%) than non-SSL baselines, and training time was reduced by 67%.

Conclusion: The proposed CLE video filter improves SSL training efficiency and effectiveness, showing promise for optimizing CLE-based medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging
modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural
analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated
by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing
machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is
complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences
with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to
overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised
learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a
video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a
non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a
filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in
SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We
use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network
with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks
were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous
cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test
accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both
considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL
is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed
CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in
self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeSliders, a training-free and modality-agnostic approach for fine-grained controllable generation in diffusion models, extended to video and audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current controllable generation methods, which require per-concept training and specific fine-tuning, thereby limiting scalability to different modalities.

Method: FreeSliders estimates the Concept Sliders formula partially during inference without the need for training or modality-specific adjustments, while also extending evaluation frameworks to video and audio with novel metrics and evaluation techniques.

Result: FreeSliders enables plug-and-play, training-free concept control across multiple modalities, surpassing existing baselines and solving challenges like scale selection and perceptual uniformity in edits.

Conclusion: The proposed FreeSliders method improves controllable generation across images, video, and audio, enabling broader scalability and laying groundwork for universal concept generation control.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become state-of-the-art generative models for images,
audio, and video, yet enabling fine-grained controllable generation, i.e.,
continuously steering specific concepts without disturbing unrelated content,
remains challenging. Concept Sliders (CS) offer a promising direction by
discovering semantic directions through textual contrasts, but they require
per-concept training and architecture-specific fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA),
limiting scalability to new modalities. In this work we introduce FreeSliders,
a simple yet effective approach that is fully training-free and
modality-agnostic, achieved by partially estimating the CS formula during
inference. To support modality-agnostic evaluation, we extend the CS benchmark
to include both video and audio, establishing the first suite for fine-grained
concept generation control with multiple modalities. We further propose three
evaluation properties along with new metrics to improve evaluation quality.
Finally, we identify an open problem of scale selection and non-linear
traversals and introduce a two-stage procedure that automatically detects
saturation points and reparameterizes traversal for perceptually uniform,
semantically meaningful edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method enables plug-and-play, training-free concept control across modalities,
improves over existing baselines, and establishes new tools for principled
controllable generation. An interactive presentation of our benchmark and
method is available at: https://azencot-group.github.io/FreeSliders/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOVAI, a hierarchical framework for text-to-video generation that emphasizes temporal consistency and compositional understanding, achieving notable improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video generation methods struggle with temporal consistency, compositional understanding, and precise visual narrative control, driving the need for a more robust system.

Method: MOVAI employs a hierarchical framework composed of a Compositional Scene Parser (CSP), a Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism (TSAM), and a Progressive Video Refinement (PVR) module for coherent and high-quality text-to-video synthesis.

Result: MOVAI significantly improves video quality metrics by 15.3% in LPIPS, 12.7% in FVD, and 18.9% in user preference studies, excelling in complex scenarios with multi-object scenes and intricate dynamics.

Conclusion: The MOVAI framework demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing core issues in text-to-video generation, offering a state-of-the-art solution with high fidelity and advanced semantic control.

Abstract: Text to video generation has emerged as a critical frontier in generative
artificial intelligence, yet existing approaches struggle with maintaining
temporal consistency, compositional understanding, and fine grained control
over visual narratives. We present MOVAI (Multimodal Original Video AI), a
novel hierarchical framework that integrates compositional scene understanding
with temporal aware diffusion models for high fidelity text to video synthesis.
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a Compositional Scene Parser
(CSP) that decomposes textual descriptions into hierarchical scene graphs with
temporal annotations, (2) a Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism (TSAM) that
ensures coherent motion dynamics across frames while preserving spatial
details, and (3) a Progressive Video Refinement (PVR) module that iteratively
enhances video quality through multi-scale temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MOVAI achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving video quality metrics by 15.3% in
LPIPS, 12.7% in FVD, and 18.9% in user preference studies compared to existing
methods. Our framework shows particular strength in generating complex

*YingQiao Wang,Eric Bigelow,Boyi Li,Tomer Ullman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method called "Chain of Time" improves and interprets physical simulations in vision-language models by generating intermediate images and requires no additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to enhance physical simulation in vision-language models and make their processes more interpretable, drawing inspiration from human mental simulation and in-context reasoning.

Method: The "Chain of Time" method involves creating intermediate simulation images to improve understanding of physical dynamics like velocity and acceleration. It is applied at inference time without further fine-tuning.

Result: The method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art image generation models in synthetic and real-world domains by accurately simulating complex physical properties.

Conclusion: "Chain of Time" not only boosts the physical reasoning capabilities of models but also provides insights into how physical processes evolve over time, exposing strengths and weaknesses of the models.

Abstract: We propose a novel cognitively-inspired method to improve and interpret
physical simulation in vision-language models. Our ``Chain of Time" method
involves generating a series of intermediate images during a simulation, and it
is motivated by in-context reasoning in machine learning, as well as mental
simulation in humans. Chain of Time is used at inference time, and requires no
additional fine-tuning. We apply the Chain-of-Time method to synthetic and
real-world domains, including 2-D graphics simulations and natural 3-D videos.
These domains test a variety of particular physical properties, including
velocity, acceleration, fluid dynamics, and conservation of momentum. We found
that using Chain-of-Time simulation substantially improves the performance of a
state-of-the-art image generation model. Beyond examining performance, we also
analyzed the specific states of the world simulated by an image model at each
time step, which sheds light on the dynamics underlying these simulations. This
analysis reveals insights that are hidden from traditional evaluations of
physical reasoning, including cases where an image generation model is able to
simulate physical properties that unfold over time, such as velocity, gravity,
and collisions. Our analysis also highlights particular cases where the image
generation model struggles to infer particular physical parameters from input
images, despite being capable of simulating relevant physical processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI-based framework incorporating generative models (GANs and VAEs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for autonomous cardiac ultrasound scanning, addressing reproducibility, operator dependency, and accessibility issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome operator dependency, limited access, and variability in cardiac ultrasound scanning due to skill and geographical constraints, and to ensure consistent, accessible, and reproducible automatic imaging.

Method: Developing an end-to-end framework using a conditional generative simulator (GAN-VAE) to model realistic cardiac environments and a DRL module for learning scanning policies, supported by expert-validated AI-driven guidance.

Result: The framework successfully integrates generative AI and DRL, enabling realistic simulation and autonomous guidance for cardiac ultrasound scanning. Validation with experiments against existing models showed effective and reproducible results.

Conclusion: This framework pioneers realistic, reproducible, and autonomous cardiac ultrasound scanning, offering a benchmarked solution, a released dataset, and potential application to other medical imaging domains.

Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound (US) is among the most widely used diagnostic tools in
cardiology for assessing heart health, but its effectiveness is limited by
operator dependence, time constraints, and human error. The shortage of trained
professionals, especially in remote areas, further restricts access. These
issues underscore the need for automated solutions that can ensure consistent,
and accessible cardiac imaging regardless of operator skill or location. Recent
progress in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), has gained attention for enabling autonomous decision-making.
However, existing DRL-based approaches to cardiac US scanning lack
reproducibility, rely on proprietary data, and use simplified models. Motivated
by these gaps, we present the first end-to-end framework that integrates
generative AI and DRL to enable autonomous and reproducible cardiac US
scanning. The framework comprises two components: (i) a conditional generative
simulator combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), that models the cardiac US environment producing realistic
action-conditioned images; and (ii) a DRL module that leverages this simulator
to learn autonomous, accurate scanning policies. The proposed framework
delivers AI-driven guidance through expert-validated models that classify image
type and assess quality, supports conditional generation of realistic US
images, and establishes a reproducible foundation extendable to other organs.
To ensure reproducibility, a publicly available dataset of real cardiac US
scans is released. The solution is validated through several experiments. The
VAE-GAN is benchmarked against existing GAN variants, with performance assessed
using qualitative and quantitative approaches, while the DRL-based scanning
system is evaluated under varying configurations to demonstrate effectiveness.

TL;DR: VLM6D introduces a dual-stream architecture to address challenges in 6D pose estimation by combining RGB and 3D data for improved robustness against challenging real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 6D pose estimation struggle to adapt from synthetic to real-world datasets, especially under challenging conditions like fluctuating lighting, textureless objects, and occlusions.

Method: VLM6D integrates a Vision Transformer (DINOv2) for processing RGB data and PointNet++ for 3D point cloud depth data, merging complementary feature streams to predict 6D poses through a multi-task head.

Result: VLM6D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occluded-LineMOD benchmark, highlighting enhanced robustness and precision in pose estimation.

Conclusion: The dual-stream approach combining visual and geometric inputs proves effective in tackling real-world pose estimation challenges, offering improved accuracy and resilience.

Abstract: The primary challenge in computer vision is precisely calculating the pose of
6D objects, however many current approaches are still fragile and have trouble
generalizing from synthetic data to real-world situations with fluctuating
lighting, textureless objects, and significant occlusions. To address these
limitations, VLM6D, a novel dual-stream architecture that leverages the
distinct strengths of visual and geometric data from RGB-D input for robust and
precise pose estimation. Our framework uniquely integrates two specialized
encoders: a powerful, self-supervised Vision Transformer (DINOv2) processes the
RGB modality, harnessing its rich, pre-trained understanding of visual grammar
to achieve remarkable resilience against texture and lighting variations.
Concurrently, a PointNet++ encoder processes the 3D point cloud derived from
depth data, enabling robust geometric reasoning that excels even with the
sparse, fragmented data typical of severe occlusion. These complementary
feature streams are effectively fused to inform a multi task prediction head.
We demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that VLM6D obtained new SOTA
performance on the challenging Occluded-LineMOD, validating its superior
robustness and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of age estimation from facial images and overcome the limitations of existing computer vision methods.

Method: A hybrid solution integrating ConvNeXt for localized feature extraction with ViT for global attention, evaluated on multiple datasets using pre-trained models, linear layers, and advanced regularization.

Result: The hybrid architecture achieved superior performance, as assessed by reduced mean absolute error (MAE) on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid outperforms traditional methods, showcasing the benefits of hybrid architectures for complex computer vision tasks like age estimation.

Abstract: Age estimation from facial images is a complex and multifaceted challenge in
computer vision. In this study, we present a novel hybrid architecture that
combines ConvNeXt, a state-of-the-art advancement of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), with Vision Transformers (ViT). While each model independently
delivers excellent performance on a variety of tasks, their integration
leverages the complementary strengths of the CNNs localized feature extraction
capabilities and the Transformers global attention mechanisms. Our proposed
ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid solution was thoroughly evaluated on benchmark age
estimation datasets, including MORPH II, CACD, and AFAD, and achieved superior
performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). To address computational
constraints, we leverage pre-trained models and systematically explore
different configurations, using linear layers and advanced regularization
techniques to optimize the architecture. Comprehensive ablation studies
highlight the critical role of individual components and training strategies,
and in particular emphasize the importance of adapted attention mechanisms
within the CNN framework to improve the model focus on age-relevant facial
features. The results show that the ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid not only outperforms
traditional methods, but also provides a robust foundation for future advances
in age estimation and related visual tasks. This work underscores the
transformative potential of hybrid architectures and represents a promising
direction for the seamless integration of CNNs and transformers to address
complex computer vision challenges.

*Janghoon Cho,Jungsoo Lee,Munawar Hayat,Kyuwoong Hwang,Fatih Porikli,Sungha Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLoC, an efficient visual token compression framework that optimizes the processing of extended video sequences for large multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-LMMs struggle with scalability due to the excessive visual token volume generated from extended video sequences.

Method: FLoC utilizes the facility location function and the lazy greedy algorithm to compress visual tokens into a compact, representative set without training, improving efficiency and performance.

Result: FLoC significantly reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining near-optimal performance. It outperforms recent compression techniques on benchmarks like Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: FLoC is a training-free and model-agnostic framework that addresses scalability challenges in long video understanding and can seamlessly integrate into current workflows.

Abstract: Recent studies in long video understanding have harnessed the advanced
visual-language reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs),
driving the evolution of video-LMMs specialized for processing extended video
sequences. However, the scalability of these models is severely limited by the
overwhelming volume of visual tokens generated from extended video sequences.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes FLoC, an efficient visual token
compression framework based on the facility location function, a principled
approach that swiftly selects a compact yet highly representative and diverse
subset of visual tokens within a predefined budget on the number of visual
tokens. By integrating the lazy greedy algorithm, our method achieves
remarkable efficiency gains by swiftly selecting a compact subset of tokens,
drastically reducing the number of visual tokens while guaranteeing
near-optimal performance. Notably, our approach is training-free,
model-agnostic, and query-agnostic, providing a versatile solution that
seamlessly integrates with diverse video-LLMs and existing workflows. Extensive
evaluations on large-scale benchmarks, such as Video-MME, MLVU, and
LongVideoBench, demonstrate that our framework consistently surpasses recent
compression techniques, highlighting not only its effectiveness and robustness
in addressing the critical challenges of long video understanding, but also its
efficiency in processing speed.

*Jinsu Kim,Yunhun Nam,Minseon Kim,Sangpil Kim,Jongheon Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve image protection against malicious edits by making adversarial noise irreversible using adaptive Gaussian blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about malicious use of image editing tools raise the need for protection methods that prevent unauthorized modifications, focusing on imperceptible and irreversible adversarial noise.

Method: The authors propose applying adaptive per-region Gaussian blur on adversarial noise to adjust its frequency spectrum, enhancing its robustness against reversal techniques.

Result: Their method improves the worst-case protection performance of existing methods across diverse scenarios and reduces perceptual quality degradation caused by adversarial noise.

Conclusion: The proposed technique demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing image protection mechanisms, maintaining performance while minimizing visual quality loss.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have increased the exposure of
powerful image editing techniques as a tool, raising concerns about their
potential for malicious use. An emerging line of research to address such
threats focuses on implanting "protective" adversarial noise into images before
their public release, so future attempts to edit them using text-to-image
models can be impeded. However, subsequent works have shown that these
adversarial noises are often easily "reversed," e.g., with techniques as simple
as JPEG compression, casting doubt on the practicality of the approach. In this
paper, we argue that adversarial noise for image protection should not only be
imperceptible, as has been a primary focus of prior work, but also
irreversible, viz., it should be difficult to detect as noise provided that the
original image is hidden. We propose a surprisingly simple method to enhance
the robustness of image protection methods against noise reversal techniques.
Specifically, it applies an adaptive per-region Gaussian blur on the noise to
adjust the overall frequency spectrum. Through extensive experiments, we show
that our method consistently improves the per-sample worst-case protection
performance of existing methods against a wide range of reversal techniques on
diverse image editing scenarios, while also reducing quality degradation due to
noise in terms of perceptual metrics. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile augmented reality applications are resource-intensive and may not perform well on devices with limited resources. Utilizing edge computing can help, but edge devices also have capacity limitations.

Method: The paper proposes using embedded devices with GPUs to handle high-intensity computational tasks in computer vision applications.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that GPUs significantly improved performance compared to CPUs, leading to better user experiences.

Conclusion: Using GPUs in embedded edge computing devices is an effective solution to address resource constraints and enhance the performance of computer vision applications.

Abstract: Computer vision applications, especially those using augmented reality
technology, are becoming quite popular in mobile devices. However, this type of
application is known as presenting significant demands regarding resources. In
order to enable its utilization in devices with more modest resources, edge
computing can be used to offload certain high intensive tasks. Still, edge

### [152] [CompAgent: An Agentic Framework for Visual Compliance Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00171)
*Rahul Ghosh,Baishali Chaudhury,Hari Prasanna Das,Meghana Ashok,Ryan Razkenari,Sungmin Hong,Chun-Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompAgent is proposed as a novel framework for visual compliance verification using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) augmented with visual tools for task adaptability and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visual compliance verification depend on costly, manually labeled datasets that have limitations in generalizability. Existing MLLMs struggle to reason about fine-grained details and structured compliance rules.

Method: The paper introduces CompAgent, a system that combines MLLMs with specific visual tools like object detectors and captioning models. A planning agent dynamically selects the required tools based on compliance policies, and a verification agent performs multi-modal reasoning and integrates outputs for policy assessment.

Result: CompAgent outperforms other methods, achieving up to 76% F1 score and improving performance by 10% on the UnsafeBench dataset compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that augmenting MLLMs with specialized tools and agentic planning enhances accuracy and scalability in visual compliance verification tasks.

Abstract: Visual compliance verification is a critical yet underexplored problem in
computer vision, especially in domains such as media, entertainment, and
advertising where content must adhere to complex and evolving policy rules.
Existing methods often rely on task-specific deep learning models trained on
manually labeled datasets, which are costly to build and limited in
generalizability. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer
broad real-world knowledge and policy understanding, they struggle to reason
over fine-grained visual details and apply structured compliance rules
effectively on their own. In this paper, we propose CompAgent, the first
agentic framework for visual compliance verification. CompAgent augments MLLMs
with a suite of visual tools - such as object detectors, face analyzers, NSFW
detectors, and captioning models - and introduces a planning agent that
dynamically selects appropriate tools based on the compliance policy. A
verification agent then integrates image, tool outputs, and policy context to
perform multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
CompAgent outperforms specialized classifiers, direct MLLM prompting, and
curated routing baselines, achieving up to 76% F1 score and a 10% improvement
over the state-of-the-art on the UnsafeBench dataset. Our results demonstrate
the effectiveness of agentic planning and tool-augmented reasoning for
scalable, accurate, and adaptable visual compliance verification.

TL;DR: The paper presents AIFo, a training-free framework utilizing multi-agent collaboration for robust detection of AI-generated images, achieving superior accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in detecting AI-generated images due to limitations in existing approaches like classifiers and vision-language models.

Method: Developed a multi-agent collaboration framework using forensic tools, LLM-based reasoning, structured debate mechanisms, and memory-augmented reasoning for improved detection.

Result: AIFo achieved 97.05% accuracy in detecting AI-generated images across various scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Agent-based procedural reasoning provides a robust, interpretable, and adaptable solution for AI-generated image detection, establishing a new paradigm.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of AI-generated images poses unprecedented challenges to
information integrity and media authenticity. Existing detection approaches
suffer from fundamental limitations: traditional classifiers lack
interpretability and fail to generalize across evolving generative models,
while vision-language models (VLMs), despite their promise, remain constrained
to single-shot analysis and pixel-level reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce AIFo (Agent-based Image Forensics), a novel training-free
framework that emulates human forensic investigation through multi-agent
collaboration. Unlike conventional methods, our framework employs a set of
forensic tools, including reverse image search, metadata extraction,
pre-trained classifiers, and VLM analysis, coordinated by specialized LLM-based
agents that collect, synthesize, and reason over cross-source evidence. When
evidence is conflicting or insufficient, a structured multi-agent debate
mechanism allows agents to exchange arguments and reach a reliable conclusion.
Furthermore, we enhance the framework with a memory-augmented reasoning module
that learns from historical cases to improve future detection accuracy. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans 6,000 images across both controlled laboratory
settings and challenging real-world scenarios, including images from modern
generative platforms and diverse online sources. AIFo achieves 97.05% accuracy,
substantially outperforming traditional classifiers and state-of-the-art VLMs.
These results demonstrate that agent-based procedural reasoning offers a new
paradigm for more robust, interpretable, and adaptable AI-generated image
detection.

TL;DR: This paper explores the advantages of vision-language multi-prompt learning, introducing Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) for better adaptability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and leverage the potential of multi-prompt learning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), moving beyond single-prompt approaches.

Method: Proposed Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL), which generates multiple prompt embeddings from an energy-based distribution defined by VLMs to enhance generalization capabilities while being parameter-efficient.

Result: EMPL demonstrated superior in-domain and out-of-domain open-vocabulary generalization capabilities through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: Multi-prompt learning via EMPL offers significant efficiency and performance improvements in adapting VLMs to diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The vision community is undergoing the unprecedented progress with the
emergence of Vision-Language Pretraining Models (VLMs). Prompt learning plays
as the holy grail of accessing VLMs since it enables their fast adaptation to
downstream tasks with limited resources. Whereas existing researches milling
around single-prompt paradigms, rarely investigate the technical potential
behind their multi-prompt learning counterparts. This paper aims to provide a
principled retrospect for vision-language multi-prompt learning. We extend the
recent constant modality gap phenomenon to learnable prompts and then, justify
the superiority of vision-language transfer with multi-prompt augmentation,
empirically and theoretically. In terms of this observation, we propose an
Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt
embeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is
implicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but
also rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain
open-vocabulary generalization. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted
to justify our claims and the excellence of EMPL.

TL;DR: The paper presents a transfer learning method for monitoring weather impact on satellite Internet performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of weather events disrupting satellite Internet services and proposes fine-grained detection methods for satellite ground components.

Method: An efficient transfer learning (TL) approach is utilized to locally detect weather-related conditions like snow and wet surfaces on ground components.

Result: The proposed TL method outperforms typical deep learning techniques such as YOLOv7, YOLOv9, Faster R-CNN, and R-YOLO in detecting adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: The TL method enhances the reliability of satellite Internet by offering generalizable and efficient weather condition detection, assisting fault diagnostics and real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of satellite Internet with low-Earth-orbit (LEO)
satellites in mega-constellations allows ubiquitous connectivity to rural and
remote areas. However, weather events have a significant impact on the
performance and reliability of satellite Internet. Adverse weather events such
as snow and rain can disturb the performance and operations of satellite
Internet's essential ground terminal components, such as satellite antennas,
significantly disrupting the space-ground link conditions between LEO
satellites and ground stations. This challenge calls for not only region-based
weather forecasts but also fine-grained detection capability on ground terminal
components of fine-grained weather conditions. Such a capability can assist in
fault diagnostics and mitigation for reliable satellite Internet, but its
solutions are lacking, not to mention the effectiveness and generalization that
are essential in real-world deployments. This paper discusses an efficient
transfer learning (TL) method that can enable a ground component to locally
detect representative weather-related conditions. The proposed method can
detect snow, wet, and other conditions resulting from adverse and typical
weather events and shows superior performance compared to the typical deep
learning methods, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv9, Faster R-CNN, and R-YOLO. Our TL
method also shows the advantage of being generalizable to various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional thresholding methods and simple channel concatenation in deep learning approaches, which fail to effectively utilize the complementary nature of polarized intensity images and phase maps in cell segmentation.

Method: The proposed method, DM-QPMNet, uses a dual-encoder network architecture with separate encoding streams for each modality. It employs multi-head attention for intermediate fusion of features and incorporates dual-source skip connections along with per-modality normalization for improved multi-modal integration.

Result: DM-QPMNet achieved significant improvements in cell segmentation performance over monolithic concatenation and single-modality approaches by effectively exploiting complementary illumination and phase information.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of modality-specific encoding combined with learnable fusion in enhancing the capabilities of single-shot quantitative phase microscopy for robust and accurate cell segmentation.

Abstract: Cell segmentation in single-shot quantitative phase microscopy (ssQPM) faces
challenges from traditional thresholding methods that are sensitive to noise
and cell density, while deep learning approaches using simple channel
concatenation fail to exploit the complementary nature of polarized intensity
images and phase maps. We introduce DM-QPMNet, a dual-encoder network that
treats these as distinct modalities with separate encoding streams. Our
architecture fuses modality-specific features at intermediate depth via
multi-head attention, enabling polarized edge and texture representations to
selectively integrate complementary phase information. This content-aware
fusion preserves training stability while adding principled multi-modal
integration through dual-source skip connections and per-modality normalization
at minimal overhead. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over
monolithic concatenation and single-modality baselines, showing that
modality-specific encoding with learnable fusion effectively exploits ssQPM's
simultaneous capture of complementary illumination and phase cues for robust
cell segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to extend optimal transport map computation from Euclidean and spherical settings to hyperbolic space, which is relevant for hierarchical data and networks.

Method: A novel geometric variational technique is proposed by adapting methods for Euclidean and spherical settings to hyperbolic geometry.

Result: The proposed method was validated through experiments on synthetic data and multi-genus surfaces, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work extends optimal transport computations to hyperbolic space and demonstrates its potential through experimental validations.

Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) problem aims to find the most efficient mapping
between two probability distributions under a given cost function, and has
diverse applications in many fields such as machine learning, computer vision
and computer graphics. However, existing methods for computing optimal
transport maps are primarily developed for Euclidean spaces and the sphere. In
this paper, we explore the problem of computing the optimal transport map in
hyperbolic space, which naturally arises in contexts involving hierarchical
data, networks, and multi-genus Riemann surfaces. We propose a novel and
efficient algorithm for computing the optimal transport map in hyperbolic space
using a geometric variational technique by extending methods for Euclidean and
spherical geometry to the hyperbolic setting. We also perform experiments on
synthetic data and multi-genus surface models to validate the efficacy of the

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for generating realistic human motions in 3D environments using object-aware 4D human motion generation combined with motion diffusion models and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models lack realistic 3D physical priors, leading to deformations and inconsistencies in generated videos.

Method: The proposed framework (MSDI) uses pre-generated 3D humans/objects, large language models (LLMs), and Motion Diffusion Score Distillation Sampling (MSDS) for spatially aware motion optimization without retraining.

Result: Experiments validate that the framework generates natural and physically plausible human motions adhering to 3D object-aware constraints.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable and generalizable generation of physically consistent 4D human motions without requiring retraining on specific datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have enabled the generation of
high-quality videos. However, these videos still suffer from unrealistic
deformations, semantic violations, and physical inconsistencies that are
largely rooted in the absence of 3D physical priors. To address these
challenges, we propose an object-aware 4D human motion generation framework
grounded in 3D Gaussian representations and motion diffusion priors. With
pre-generated 3D humans and objects, our method, Motion Score Distilled
Interaction (MSDI), employs the spatial and prompt semantic information in
large language models (LLMs) and motion priors through the proposed Motion
Diffusion Score Distillation Sampling (MSDS). The combination of MSDS and LLMs
enables our spatial-aware motion optimization, which distills score gradients
from pre-trained motion diffusion models, to refine human motion while
respecting object and semantic constraints. Unlike prior methods requiring
joint training on limited interaction datasets, our zero-shot approach avoids
retraining and generalizes to out-of-distribution object aware human motions.
Experiments demonstrate that our framework produces natural and physically
plausible human motions that respect 3D spatial context, offering a scalable
solution for realistic 4D generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the L48 dataset, a real-world fine-grained multi-label dataset for single-positive multi-label (SPML) settings, derived from bird sound recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of synthetic datasets in SPML research and provide a realistic dataset that captures fine-grained complexities for challenging benchmarks.

Method: Develop and introduce the L48 dataset focusing on bird sound recordings with natural single-positive annotations and extended settings providing additional negative labels.

Result: Existing SPML methods were benchmarked on L48, revealing significant performance differences compared to synthetic datasets and identifying weaknesses in current methods.

Conclusion: Realistic and challenging benchmarks like L48 are essential for advancing SPML methods and narrowing the gap between partially-labeled and fully-supervised learning.

Abstract: In the single-positive multi-label (SPML) setting, each image in a dataset is
labeled with the presence of a single class, while the true presence of other
classes remains unknown. The challenge is to narrow the performance gap between
this partially-labeled setting and fully-supervised learning, which often
requires a significant annotation budget. Prior SPML methods were developed and
benchmarked on synthetic datasets created by randomly sampling single positive
labels from fully-annotated datasets like Pascal VOC, COCO, NUS-WIDE, and
CUB200. However, this synthetic approach does not reflect real-world scenarios
and fails to capture the fine-grained complexities that can lead to difficult
misclassifications. In this work, we introduce the L48 dataset, a fine-grained,
real-world multi-label dataset derived from recordings of bird sounds. L48
provides a natural SPML setting with single-positive annotations on a
challenging, fine-grained domain, as well as two extended settings in which
domain priors give access to additional negative labels. We benchmark existing
SPML methods on L48 and observe significant performance differences compared to
synthetic datasets and analyze method weaknesses, underscoring the need for
more realistic and difficult benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based automated pipeline that detects, crops, and segments beetle images from tray images to streamline biological research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biologists need to efficiently process large-scale beetle image data for entomology and ecology research, which is difficult with manual methods.

Method: The authors propose a 3-stage pipeline involving beetle detection, cropping, and fine-grained morphological segmentation using transformer-based detection and segmentation models.

Result: The pipeline improves detection and segmentation accuracy, successfully processes tray images into individual beetle data, and utilizes 670 labeled beetle images for training.

Conclusion: This pipeline enhances data processing efficiency for beetle-centric research, advancing biological studies and reducing manual effort.

Abstract: In entomology and ecology research, biologists often need to collect a large
number of insects, among which beetles are the most common species. A common
practice for biologists to organize beetles is to place them on trays and take
a picture of each tray. Given the images of thousands of such trays, it is
important to have an automated pipeline to process the large-scale data for
further research. Therefore, we develop a 3-stage pipeline to detect all the
beetles on each tray, sort and crop the image of each beetle, and do
morphological segmentation on the cropped beetles. For detection, we design an
iterative process utilizing a transformer-based open-vocabulary object detector
and a vision-language model. For segmentation, we manually labeled 670 beetle
images and fine-tuned two variants of a transformer-based segmentation model to
achieve fine-grained segmentation of beetles with relatively high accuracy. The
pipeline integrates multiple deep learning methods and is specialized for
beetle image processing, which can greatly improve the efficiency to process
large-scale beetle data and accelerate biological research.

*Linzhe Jiang,Jiayuan Huang,Sophia Bano,Matthew J. Clarkson,Zhehua Mao,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MambaNetLK, a novel 3D registration framework for colonoscopy navigation, along with a large clinical benchmark dataset (C3VD-Raycasting-10k), achieving superior performance in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the challenges in 3D point cloud registration caused by feature degeneracy in biological tissues and substantial domain shifts during minimally invasive colonoscopy procedures.

Method: Develop MambaNetLK, a correspondence-free registration framework that enhances PointNetLK with a Mamba State Space Model for cross-modal feature extraction, combined with iterative Lucas-Kanade alignment.

Result: MambaNetLK achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing rotation and translation errors significantly compared to other methods, and demonstrates strong generalization and robustness on additional datasets.

Conclusion: MambaNetLK and the clinical dataset establish a robust foundation for enhancing surgical navigation systems, ensuring more accurate and reliable guidance in procedures like colonoscopy.

Abstract: Accurate 3D point cloud registration underpins reliable image-guided
colonoscopy, directly affecting lesion localization, margin assessment, and
navigation safety. However, biological tissue exhibits repetitive textures and
locally homogeneous geometry that cause feature degeneracy, while substantial
domain shifts between pre-operative anatomy and intra-operative observations
further degrade alignment stability. To address these clinically critical
challenges, we introduce a novel 3D registration method tailored for endoscopic
navigation and a high-quality, clinically grounded dataset to support rigorous
and reproducible benchmarking. We introduce C3VD-Raycasting-10k, a large-scale
benchmark dataset with 10,014 geometrically aligned point cloud pairs derived
from clinical CT data. We propose MambaNetLK, a novel correspondence-free
registration framework, which enhances the PointNetLK architecture by
integrating a Mamba State Space Model (SSM) as a cross-modal feature extractor.
As a result, the proposed framework efficiently captures long-range
dependencies with linear-time complexity. The alignment is achieved iteratively
using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. On the clinical dataset, C3VD-Raycasting-10k,
MambaNetLK achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, reducing median rotation error by 56.04% and RMSE translation error by
26.19% over the second-best method. The model also demonstrates strong
generalization on ModelNet40 and superior robustness to initial pose
perturbations. MambaNetLK provides a robust foundation for 3D registration in
surgical navigation. The combination of a globally expressive SSM-based feature
extractor and a large-scale clinical dataset enables more accurate and reliable
guidance systems in minimally invasive procedures like colonoscopy.

*Neha Balamurugan,Sarah Wu,Adam Chun,Gabe Gaw,Cristobal Eyzaguirre,Tobias Gerstenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spot The Ball, a benchmark evaluating visual social inference in AI models, showing that humans outperform models significantly in localizing removed sports balls based on social cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust human-like social reasoning in AI and vision-language models, particularly in interpreting behavioral cues for inference.

Method: A benchmark task, Spot The Ball, focusing on sports images where the ball is removed. Four VLMs are tested with different prompting strategies, alongside human baselines, using curated and scalable datasets.

Result: Humans performed 2-3 times more accurately (20-34%) compared to models (≤17%), with models relying on spatial heuristics rather than social cues.

Conclusion: Current models show a significant gap in visual social inference. To mimic human-level reasoning, architectures must integrate structured behavioral cues.

Abstract: Humans excel at visual social inference, the ability to infer hidden elements
of a scene from subtle behavioral cues such as other people's gaze, pose, and
orientation. This ability drives everyday social reasoning in humans and is
critical for developing more human-like AI agents. We introduce Spot The Ball,
a challenging benchmark for evaluating visual social inference in
vision-language models (VLMs) using sports as a test domain. The task is to
localize a removed sports ball from soccer, basketball, and volleyball images.
We present a curated evaluation set with human baselines and a scalable
pipeline for generating additional test items. We evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini, GPT, LLaMA, Qwen) using three prompting
strategies, finding that humans are consistently two to three times more
accurate (20-34%) than models ($\leq$ 17%) across all sports. Our analyses show
that models rely on superficial spatial heuristics--such as guessing near the
image center or nearby players--while humans leverage social cues like gaze
direction and body pose. These findings reveal a persistent human-model gap in
visual social reasoning and underscore the need for architectures that
explicitly encode structured behavioral cues to achieve robust, human-like
inference.

### [164] [FedReplay: A Feature Replay Assisted Federated Transfer Learning Framework for Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Smart Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00269)
*Long Li,Jiajia Li,Dong Chen,Lina Pu,Haibo Yao,Yanbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a federated learning framework using a frozen CLIP ViT model combined with a lightweight transformer classifier to address privacy concerns, reduce communication costs, and enhance accuracy in smart agriculture tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate classification in smart agriculture faces challenges such as privacy concerns with centralized training, high communication costs, and non-IID data in federated learning.

Method: The framework integrates a frozen CLIP vision transformer for feature extraction with a lightweight transformer classifier. It includes sharing a small subset of non-reversible feature representations extracted by CLIP across clients to mitigate non-IID data issues while preserving privacy.

Result: The proposed method achieved 86.6% accuracy on agricultural classification tasks, which is more than 4 times higher than baseline federated learning methods.

Conclusion: The combination of vision-language pre-trained model features and federated learning offers an efficient, privacy-preserving, and effective solution for smart agriculture applications.

Abstract: Accurate classification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture, enabling
applications such as crop monitoring, fruit recognition, and pest detection.
However, conventional centralized training often requires large-scale data
collection, which raises privacy concerns, while standard federated learning
struggles with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and
incurs high communication costs. To address these challenges, we propose a
federated learning framework that integrates a frozen Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vision transformer (ViT) with a lightweight
transformer classifier. By leveraging the strong feature extraction capability
of the pre-trained CLIP ViT, the framework avoids training large-scale models
from scratch and restricts federated updates to a compact classifier, thereby
reducing transmission overhead significantly. Furthermore, to mitigate
performance degradation caused by non-IID data distribution, a small subset
(1%) of CLIP-extracted feature representations from all classes is shared
across clients. These shared features are non-reversible to raw images,
ensuring privacy preservation while aligning class representation across
participants. Experimental results on agricultural classification tasks show
that the proposed method achieve 86.6% accuracy, which is more than 4 times
higher compared to baseline federated learning approaches. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of combining vision-language model features
with federated learning for privacy-preserving and scalable agricultural
intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PersonalView is introduced as an adaptation method that enables pre-trained generative models to produce multi-view images of individuals with minimal training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods struggle with generating consistent multi-view images of individuals. This paper aims to address the challenge of viewpoint control and consistency in generated images.

Method: The paper introduces PersonalView, which uses a conditioning architecture for diffusion transformers and a Semantic Correspondence Alignment Loss to preserve original generative capabilities while enabling multi-view generation.

Result: PersonalView achieves significant improvement in multi-view image consistency, text alignment, identity similarity, and visual quality compared to other methods, even with only 100 training samples.

Conclusion: The proposed method, PersonalView, successfully enables lightweight multi-view generation for personalized images, outperforming existing methods while requiring far less training data.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized generative models demonstrate impressive
results in creating identity-consistent images of the same person under diverse
settings. Yet, we note that most methods cannot control the viewpoint of the
generated image, nor generate consistent multiple views of the person. To
address this problem, we propose a lightweight adaptation method, PersonalView,
capable of enabling an existing model to acquire multi-view generation
capability with as few as 100 training samples. PersonalView consists of two
key components: First, we design a conditioning architecture to take advantage
of the in-context learning ability of the pre-trained diffusion transformer.
Second, we preserve the original generative ability of the pretrained model
with a new Semantic Correspondence Alignment Loss. We evaluate the multi-view
consistency, text alignment, identity similarity, and visual quality of
PersonalView and compare it to recent baselines with potential capability of
multi-view customization. PersonalView significantly outperforms baselines
trained on a large corpus of multi-view data with only 100 training samples.

*Isai Daniel Chacón,Paola Ruiz Puentes,Jillian Pearse,Pablo Arbeláez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LITHOS, a large-scale experimental framework for automated petrography, incorporating deep learning techniques to improve mineral classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Petrography is critical in multiple fields but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability, which necessitates automated techniques.

Method: Developed the LITHOS dataset, proposed a dual-encoder transformer architecture leveraging polarization modalities, and benchmarked deep learning techniques for mineral classification.

Result: LITHOS dataset contains over 211,604 varied RGB patches and 105,802 expert-annotated grains. The dual-encoder transformer outperforms single-polarization models in mineral classification.

Conclusion: LITHOS offers a robust experimental foundation for advancing automated petrography with its publicly available dataset, code, and pretrained models.

Abstract: Petrography is a branch of geology that analyzes the mineralogical
composition of rocks from microscopical thin section samples. It is essential
for understanding rock properties across geology, archaeology, engineering,
mineral exploration, and the oil industry. However, petrography is a
labor-intensive task requiring experts to conduct detailed visual examinations
of thin section samples through optical polarization microscopes, thus
hampering scalability and highlighting the need for automated techniques. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Large-scale Imaging and Thin section
Optical-polarization Set (LITHOS), the largest and most diverse publicly
available experimental framework for automated petrography. LITHOS includes
211,604 high-resolution RGB patches of polarized light and 105,802
expert-annotated grains across 25 mineral categories. Each annotation consists
of the mineral class, spatial coordinates, and expert-defined major and minor
axes represented as intersecting vector paths, capturing grain geometry and
orientation. We evaluate multiple deep learning techniques for mineral
classification in LITHOS and propose a dual-encoder transformer architecture
that integrates both polarization modalities as a strong baseline for future
reference. Our method consistently outperforms single-polarization models,
demonstrating the value of polarization synergy in mineral classification. We
have made the LITHOS Benchmark publicly available, comprising our dataset,
code, and pretrained models, to foster reproducibility and further research in
automated petrographic analysis.

*Weidong Zhang,Pak Lun Kevin Ding,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 11 lightweight vision models across diverse datasets to gauge their generalization and introduces xScore for robust performance prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether models excelling on ImageNet generalize across other domains and identify factors influencing robustness of lightweight vision models.

Method: Systematic evaluation of lightweight models across 7 datasets using a fixed training schedule and introducing xScore for robustness measurement.

Result: ImageNet accuracy inconsistently predicts performance on diverse datasets; xScore predicts mobile model robustness using fewer datasets; specific architectural elements promote generalization while Transformer blocks add limited benefit.

Conclusion: xScore is a scalable metric for robustness, offering a reproducible framework that highlights design principles promoting generalization in lightweight, resource-constrained models.

Abstract: Lightweight vision classification models such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and
EfficientNet are increasingly deployed in mobile and embedded systems, yet
their performance has been predominantly benchmarked on ImageNet. This raises
critical questions: Do models that excel on ImageNet also generalize across
other domains? How can cross-dataset robustness be systematically quantified?
And which architectural elements consistently drive generalization under tight
resource constraints? Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of 11
lightweight vision models (2.5M parameters), trained under a fixed 100-epoch
schedule across 7 diverse datasets. We introduce the Cross-Dataset Score
(xScore), a unified metric that quantifies the consistency and robustness of
model performance across diverse visual domains. Our results show that (1)
ImageNet accuracy does not reliably predict performance on fine-grained or
medical datasets, (2) xScore provides a scalable predictor of mobile model
performance that can be estimated from just four datasets, and (3) certain
architectural components--such as isotropic convolutions with higher spatial
resolution and channel-wise attention--promote broader generalization, while
Transformer-based blocks yield little additional benefit, despite incurring
higher parameter overhead. This study provides a reproducible framework for
evaluating lightweight vision models beyond ImageNet, highlights key design
principles for mobile-friendly architectures, and guides the development of
future models that generalize robustly across diverse application domains.

datasets demonstrates its robustness, scalability, and precision, showcasing
its broad potential applications in computational physics and imaging sciences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of missing modalities in Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations by introducing a federated learning framework called FedDISC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the performance degradation caused by unpredictable modality absence in real-world applications of multimodal emotion recognition.

Method: The FedDISC framework integrates federated learning with modality-specific diffusion models optimized through a collaborative approach, leveraging Dialogue Graph Network and Semantic Conditioning Network for consistency.

Result: FedDISC achieves superior emotion classification performance on datasets like IEMOCAP, CMUMOSI, and CMUMOSEI, outperforming existing methods when modalities are missing.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles missing modality challenges in multimodal emotion recognition, delivering improved classification accuracy under diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) enhances emotional
understanding through the fusion of multimodal signals. However, unpredictable
modality absence in real-world scenarios significantly degrades the performance
of existing methods. Conventional missing-modality recovery approaches, which
depend on training with complete multimodal data, often suffer from semantic
distortion under extreme data distributions, such as fixed-modality absence. To
address this, we propose the Federated Dialogue-guided and Semantic-Consistent
Diffusion (FedDISC) framework, pioneering the integration of federated learning
into missing-modality recovery. By federated aggregation of modality-specific
diffusion models trained on clients and broadcasting them to clients missing
corresponding modalities, FedDISC overcomes single-client reliance on modality
completeness. Additionally, the DISC-Diffusion module ensures consistency in
context, speaker identity, and semantics between recovered and available
modalities, using a Dialogue Graph Network to capture conversational
dependencies and a Semantic Conditioning Network to enforce semantic alignment.
We further introduce a novel Alternating Frozen Aggregation strategy, which
cyclically freezes recovery and classifier modules to facilitate collaborative
optimization. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP, CMUMOSI, and CMUMOSEI
datasets demonstrate that FedDISC achieves superior emotion classification
performance across diverse missing modality patterns, outperforming existing
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSMGen is a framework that uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to generate realistic satellite imagery, enabling urban monitoring and addressing limited geospatial dataset availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of automating urban monitoring due to the lack of curated datasets related to urban features and their changes.

Method: OSMGen uses OSM JSON data, including rich vector geometries and semantic information, to generate realistic satellite imagery. It creates consistent before-and-after image pairs from user edits and map data.

Result: The system allows generation of balanced training datasets, previews of urban interventions, and lays the groundwork for systems where satellite imagery can directly update OSM data.

Conclusion: OSMGen enhances geospatial data accuracy and training capabilities, addressing data scarcity and imbalance issues, with potential applications in urban planning and monitoring efforts.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date geospatial data are essential for urban planning,
infrastructure monitoring, and environmental management. Yet, automating urban
monitoring remains difficult because curated datasets of specific urban
features and their changes are scarce. We introduce OSMGen, a generative
framework that creates realistic satellite imagery directly from raw
OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Unlike prior work that relies on raster tiles, OSMGen
uses the full richness of OSM JSON, including vector geometries, semantic tags,
location, and time, giving fine-grained control over how scenes are generated.
A central feature of the framework is the ability to produce consistent
before-after image pairs: user edits to OSM inputs translate into targeted
visual changes, while the rest of the scene is preserved. This makes it
possible to generate training data that addresses scarcity and class imbalance,
and to give planners a simple way to preview proposed interventions by editing
map data. More broadly, OSMGen produces paired (JSON, image) data for both
static and changed states, paving the way toward a closed-loop system where
satellite imagery can automatically drive structured OSM updates. Source code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diffusion-based forensic approach to effectively identify AI-generated images even when they are photorealistic and artifact-free.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E produce photorealistic images, making it increasingly difficult for traditional methods to differentiate real and synthetic imagery.

Method: The study introduces 'diffusion snap-back,' a forensic framework that uses multi-strength image reconstruction dynamics and analyzes reconstruction metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) across noise levels to differentiate real and synthetic images.

Result: Through evaluation on 4,000 balanced images, the method achieves an AUROC of 0.993 under cross-validation and is robust to distortions like compression and noise.

Conclusion: The approach shows strong generalization and scalability using limited data, providing a model-agnostic foundation for forensic detection of synthetic media.

Abstract: The rapid rise of generative diffusion models has made distinguishing
authentic visual content from synthetic imagery increasingly challenging.
Traditional deepfake detection methods, which rely on frequency or pixel-level
artifacts, fail against modern text-to-image systems such as Stable Diffusion
and DALL-E that produce photorealistic and artifact-free results. This paper
introduces a diffusion-based forensic framework that leverages multi-strength
image reconstruction dynamics, termed diffusion snap-back, to identify
AI-generated images. By analysing how reconstruction metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and
PSNR) evolve across varying noise strengths, we extract interpretable
manifold-based features that differentiate real and synthetic images. Evaluated
on a balanced dataset of 4,000 images, our approach achieves 0.993 AUROC under
cross-validation and remains robust to common distortions such as compression
and noise. Despite using limited data and a single diffusion backbone (Stable
Diffusion v1.5), the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization and
interpretability, offering a foundation for scalable, model-agnostic synthetic
media forensics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on onboard cloud segmentation for CubeSat missions in Earth observation, introducing a Thermal UNet model pre-trained on public data and fine-tuned for mission-specific samples, achieving efficient and accurate cloud masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CubeSat missions struggle with cloud segmentation due to limited hardware, spectral information, and labeled data, making traditional masking techniques impractical.

Method: The authors used a lightweight UNet model with MobileNet encoder, pre-training on the Landsat-7 dataset and fine-tuning on mission-specific samples in a joint-training setup.

Result: The method improved the macro F1 score from 0.850 to 0.877, and demonstrated efficient inference on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano in under 5 seconds.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with public datasets and lightweight architectures enables accurate and efficient thermal cloud segmentation for real-time decision-making in resource-limited CubeSat missions.

Abstract: Onboard cloud segmentation is a critical yet underexplored task in thermal
Earth observation (EO), particularly for CubeSat missions constrained by
limited hardware and spectral information. CubeSats often rely on a single
thermal band and lack sufficient labeled data, making conventional cloud
masking techniques infeasible. This work addresses these challenges by applying
transfer learning to thermal cloud segmentation for the FOREST-2 CubeSat, using
a UNet with a lightweight MobileNet encoder. We pretrain the model on the
public Landsat-7 Cloud Cover Assessment Dataset and fine-tune it with a small
set of mission-specific samples in a joint-training setup, improving the macro
F1 from 0.850 to 0.877 over FOREST-2-only baselines. We convert the model to a
TensorRT engine and demonstrate full-image inference in under 5 seconds on an
NVIDIA Jetson Nano. These results show that leveraging public datasets and
lightweight architectures can enable accurate, efficient thermal-only cloud
masking on-orbit, supporting real-time decision-making in data-limited EO
missions.

TL;DR: Cultural heritage restoration in Bangladesh is enhanced using Oitijjo-3D, a free AI framework leveraging Google Street View imagery to generate 3D models quickly, affordably, and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D digitization methods are costly, require expertise, and extensive access, making preservation infeasible for developing nations like Bangladesh, where architectural monuments remain at risk.

Method: Oitijjo-3D utilizes generative AI with a two-stage pipeline: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for texture synthesis, and Hexagen for geometry recovery, based on publicly available imagery.

Result: Experiments on Bangladeshi landmarks show Oitijjo-3D produces visually and structurally coherent reconstructions, significantly reducing costs and expertise requirements.

Conclusion: Oitijjo-3D positions cultural preservation as a community-driven, cost-effective, and AI-assisted effort, offering a scalable solution in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Cultural heritage restoration in Bangladesh faces a dual challenge of limited
resources and scarce technical expertise. Traditional 3D digitization methods,
such as photogrammetry or LiDAR scanning, require expensive hardware, expert
operators, and extensive on-site access, which are often infeasible in
developing contexts. As a result, many of Bangladesh's architectural treasures,
from the Paharpur Buddhist Monastery to Ahsan Manzil, remain vulnerable to
decay and inaccessible in digital form. This paper introduces Oitijjo-3D, a
cost-free generative AI framework that democratizes 3D cultural preservation.
By using publicly available Google Street View imagery, Oitijjo-3D reconstructs
faithful 3D models of heritage structures through a two-stage pipeline -
multimodal visual reasoning with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for structure-texture
synthesis, and neural image-to-3D generation through Hexagen for geometry
recovery. The system produces photorealistic, metrically coherent
reconstructions in seconds, achieving significant speedups compared to
conventional Structure-from-Motion pipelines, without requiring any specialized
hardware or expert supervision. Experiments on landmarks such as Ahsan Manzil,
Choto Sona Mosque, and Paharpur demonstrate that Oitijjo-3D preserves both
visual and structural fidelity while drastically lowering economic and
technical barriers. By turning open imagery into digital heritage, this work
reframes preservation as a community-driven, AI-assisted act of cultural
continuity for resource-limited nations.

*Chaochen Wu,Guan Luo,Meiyun Zuo,Zhitao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach and a multi-agent framework to improve video moment retrieval using text queries while managing conflicts among models and identifying irrelevant queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video moment retrieval fail to address conflicts among model outputs, limiting their effectiveness in accurately matching text queries to video moments efficiently.

Method: The authors introduced a reinforcement learning model to scan videos for moments boundaries and a multi-agent evidential learning framework to resolve conflicts in localization outputs.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The study shows that resolving multi-agent conflicts through evidential learning is effective in enhancing reinforcement learning for moment retrieval and highlights its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval uses a text query to locate a moment from a given
untrimmed video reference. Locating corresponding video moments with text
queries helps people interact with videos efficiently. Current solutions for
this task have not considered conflict within location results from different
models, so various models cannot integrate correctly to produce better results.
This study introduces a reinforcement learning-based video moment retrieval
model that can scan the whole video once to find the moment's boundary while
producing its locational evidence. Moreover, we proposed a multi-agent system
framework that can use evidential learning to resolve conflicts between agents'
localization output. As a side product of observing and dealing with conflicts
between agents, we can decide whether a query has no corresponding moment in a
video (out-of-scope) without additional training, which is suitable for
real-world applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the
effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with state-of-the-art
approaches. Furthermore, the results of our study reveal that modeling
competition and conflict of the multi-agent system is an effective way to
improve RL performance in moment retrieval and show the new role of evidential
learning in the multi-agent framework.

Result: VisionCAD achieves comparable performance to traditional CAD systems with minimal degradation in diagnostic quality or reporting accuracy.

Conclusion: VisionCAD offers a practical and accessible solution for integrating AI diagnostics into various clinical settings without altering existing systems.

Abstract: Widespread clinical deployment of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems is
hindered by the challenge of integrating with existing hospital IT
infrastructure. Here, we introduce VisionCAD, a vision-based radiological
assistance framework that circumvents this barrier by capturing medical images
directly from displays using a camera system. The framework operates through an
automated pipeline that detects, restores, and analyzes on-screen medical
images, transforming camera-captured visual data into diagnostic-quality images
suitable for automated analysis and report generation. We validated VisionCAD
across diverse medical imaging datasets, demonstrating that our modular
architecture can flexibly utilize state-of-the-art diagnostic models for
specific tasks. The system achieves diagnostic performance comparable to
conventional CAD systems operating on original digital images, with an F1-score
degradation typically less than 2\% across classification tasks, while natural
language generation metrics for automated reports remain within 1\% of those
derived from original images. By requiring only a camera device and standard
computing resources, VisionCAD offers an accessible approach for AI-assisted
diagnosis, enabling the deployment of diagnostic capabilities in diverse
clinical settings without modifications to existing infrastructure.

*Fan Zhang,Haoxuan Li,Shengju Qian,Xin Wang,Zheng Lian,Hao Wu,Zhihong Zhu,Yuan Gao,Qiankun Li,Yefeng Zheng,Zhouchen Lin,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark (FERBench) to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on facial expression recognition (FER) tasks, develops post-training strategies, and proposes a new FER foundation model, UniFER-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of exploration into the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on facial expression recognition (FER) tasks and to improve reasoning and interpretability in these models.

Method: The authors converted FER datasets into a visual question-answering (VQA) format, benchmarked 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs on FER datasets, curated two datasets (UniFER-CoT-230K and UniFER-RLVR-360K) for model improvement, and developed UniFER-7B, a unified interpretable model.

Result: The study shows that while MLLMs perform well in classification, they struggle with reasoning and interpretability. Their UniFER-7B model, however, outperforms other generalist MLLMs in FER tasks.

Conclusion: MLLMs still have significant limitations in facial expression reasoning and interpretability, and the proposed strategies and the UniFER-7B model demonstrate advancements in addressing these issues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized numerous
research fields, including computer vision and affective computing. As a
pivotal challenge in this interdisciplinary domain, facial expression
recognition (FER) has evolved from separate, domain-specific models to more
unified approaches. One promising avenue to unify FER tasks is converting
conventional FER datasets into visual question-answering (VQA) formats,
enabling the direct application of powerful generalist MLLMs for inference.
However, despite the success of cutting-edge MLLMs in various tasks, their
performance on FER tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
provide FERBench, a systematic benchmark that incorporates 20 state-of-the-art
MLLMs across four widely used FER datasets. Our results reveal that, while
MLLMs exhibit good classification performance, they still face significant
limitations in reasoning and interpretability. To this end, we introduce
post-training strategies aimed at enhancing the facial expression reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we curate two high-quality and large-scale
datasets: UniFER-CoT-230K for cold-start initialization and UniFER-RLVR-360K
for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), respectively.
Building upon them, we develop a unified and interpretable FER foundation model
termed UniFER-7B, which outperforms many open-sourced and closed-source
generalist MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Qwen2.5-VL-72B).

TL;DR: VinciCoder is a multimodal code generation model that uses supervised finetuning and visual reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art results in generating and refining code from visual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of single-task training regimens in vision-language models, which restrict their ability to generalize for tasks involving multimodal code generation.

Method: A two-stage training framework is introduced, consisting of Large-Scale Supervised Finetuning (SFT) with 1.6M image-code pairs and a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy that uses coarse-to-fine rewards.

Result: Experimental results highlight VinciCoder's state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal code generation benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of its training strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, VinciCoder, successfully addresses the narrow scope of prior methods and sets a new benchmark in multimodal code generation, with code and model availability for further research.

Abstract: Multimodal code generation has garnered significant interest within the
research community. Despite the notable success of recent vision-language
models (VLMs) on specialized tasks like Chart-to-code generation, their
reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that
hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode
\textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a
unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a
two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised
Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving
direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we
introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a
coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating
visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments
on various multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our
coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy. The code and model will be available at

*Long Li,Shuichen Ji,Ziyang Luo,Nian Liu,Dingwen Zhang,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to handle three different saliency tasks (SOD, CoSOD, SIS) by employing Chain-of-Thought reasoning and introducing innovative methods like Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address heterogeneity across three distinct saliency tasks effectively and unify their operational processes within a robust framework.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage Chain-of-Thought training paradigm: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for logical consistency and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the novel CGPO algorithm to optimize the model's confidence and reward-based learning process.

Result: The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance across saliency tasks, with a notable improvement in the S-measure for CoSOD, outperforming previous models by a significant margin despite utilizing less training data.

Conclusion: This unified framework efficiently bridges task heterogeneity in saliency tasks, improves model performance, and demonstrates the potential of leveraging Vision-Language Models combined with advanced training techniques.

Abstract: We present the first unified framework that jointly handles three
operationally heterogeneous saliency tasks, eg, SOD, CoSOD, and SIS, by casting
each as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process in a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) to bridge task heterogeneity. CoT training follows a two-stage paradigm:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). To enhance CoT
quality in RL, we propose Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO), a
lightweight single-sample algorithm that leverages the discrepancy between
reward and model confidence as a per-sample advantage signal. This design
naturally focuses updates on informative responses while eliminating group
sampling, thereby addressing GRPO's key limitations: confidence-agnostic
learning, signal dilution, and prohibitive computational overhead. We also
introduce an "output-to-reasoning" strategy to construct high-fidelity SFT data
that ensures logical consistency with ground-truth masks. Experiments show our
model matches or outperforms specialized SOTA methods and strong closed-source
VLMs across all tasks, especially achieving an S-measure of 0.899 on CoCA for
CoSOD, surpassing the prior best by 8.0 percentage points, despite using far
less training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGCA improves zero-shot image classification by addressing misinformation caused by random image cropping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of pretrained models like CLIP and address misinformation in zero-shot image classification.

Method: Proposes Localized-Globalized Cross-Alignment (LGCA) to prioritize salient image regions and balance local-global features.

Result: LGCA achieves better zero-shot classification results across datasets while maintaining efficient scalability.

Conclusion: LGCA effectively minimizes bias and misinformation, exhibiting strong performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale pretraining in natural language processing
have enabled pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP to effectively
align images and text, significantly improving performance in zero-shot image
classification tasks. Subsequent studies have further demonstrated that
cropping images into smaller regions and using large language models to
generate multiple descriptions for each caption can further enhance model
performance. However, due to the inherent sensitivity of CLIP, random image
crops can introduce misinformation and bias, as many images share similar
features at small scales. To address this issue, we propose
Localized-Globalized Cross-Alignment (LGCA), a framework that first captures
the local features of an image and then repeatedly selects the most salient
regions and expands them. The similarity score is designed to incorporate both
the original and expanded images, enabling the model to capture both local and
global features while minimizing misinformation. Additionally, we provide a
theoretical analysis demonstrating that the time complexity of LGCA remains the
same as that of the original model prior to the repeated expansion process,
highlighting its efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method substantially improves zero-shot performance across diverse
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

### [180] [Leveraging Hierarchical Image-Text Misalignment for Universal Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00427)
*Daichi Zhang,Tong Zhang,Jianmin Bao,Shiming Ge,Sabine Süsstrunk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting fake images from generative models by introducing a novel multi-modal method leveraging image-text misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing binary image classification methods that overly rely on visual clues, leading to poor generalization to new generative models.

Method: The authors propose ITEM, a detector that utilizes image-text misalignment in CLIP's joint visual-language space. They measure alignment issues between images and captions, and introduce a hierarchical scheme for both global and object-specific misalignment detection.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ITEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering better generalization and robustness against various generative models.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging multi-modal misalignment is an effective strategy for detecting fake images and improving generalization across unseen models.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative models, detecting generated fake
images to prevent their malicious use has become a critical issue recently.
Existing methods frame this challenge as a naive binary image classification
task. However, such methods focus only on visual clues, yielding trained
detectors susceptible to overfitting specific image patterns and incapable of
generalizing to unseen models. In this paper, we address this issue from a
multi-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned
with corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we
propose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the
image-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative
clues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and
captions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the
usual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment
scheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object
described in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local
semantic misalignment as clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors with
impressive generalization and robustness on various recent generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust method to detect diffusion-generated images by analyzing frequency differences and enhancing discriminative clues across frequency bands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about malicious use of high-quality images generated by diffusion models, and the limitations of existing detectors in generalizing to unseen models and handling perturbations.

Method: A frequency-selective function is used as a weighted filter to enhance discriminative frequency bands, leveraging the differences between real and diffusion-generated images across all frequency bands.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior generalization capabilities and robustness compared to state-of-the-art detectors across various diffusion-generated image datasets.

Conclusion: Enhancing frequency-based differences effectively improves detection of diffusion-generated images, addressing challenges of unseen models and perturbations.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but the
generated high-quality images raise concerns about potential malicious use.
Existing detectors often struggle to capture discriminative clues across
different models and settings, limiting their generalization to unseen
diffusion models and robustness to various perturbations. To address this
issue, we observe that diffusion-generated images exhibit progressively larger
differences from natural real images across low- to high-frequency bands. Based
on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective representation by enhancing
the Frequency Forgery Clue (F^2C) across all frequency bands. Specifically, we
introduce a frequency-selective function which serves as a weighted filter to
the Fourier spectrum, suppressing less discriminative bands while enhancing
more informative ones. This approach, grounded in a comprehensive analysis of
frequency-based differences between natural real and diffusion-generated
images, enables general detection of images from unseen diffusion models and
provides robust resilience to various perturbations. Extensive experiments on
various diffusion-generated image datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors with superior generalization and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating adversarial text samples targeting text-image contrastive models like CLIP during pre-training, revealing vulnerabilities to data poisoning in the text modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored domain of text-based vulnerabilities in CLIP training and improve understanding of potential risks in vision-language pre-training.

Method: The framework uses a background-aware selector and a background-driven augmenter to craft poisoned texts that are semantically coherent and consistent with the target class.

Result: ToxicTextCLIP achieved high poisoning and backdoor success rates, bypassing defenses like RoCLIP, CleanCLIP, and SafeCLIP.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of understanding text-based data poisoning risks in CLIP-like models and demonstrates the efficacy of ToxicTextCLIP in exploiting vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly
advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale
web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on
uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor
risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the
text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for
generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the
pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic
misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the
scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively
applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background
content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that
generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive
experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP
achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while
bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses. The source code can be

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised, explainable AI models enhance transparency and clinical trust in pneumonia diagnosis while making the process cost-effective and interpretable.

Abstract: This study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia
classification and localization from chest X-rays, utilizing Grad-CAM
explanations. Instead of costly pixel-level annotations, our approach utilizes
image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight
regions affected by pneumonia. We evaluate seven ImageNet-pretrained
architectures ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V2/V3, and
ViT-B16 under identical training conditions with focal loss and patient-wise
splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results on the Kermany CXR dataset
demonstrate that ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 achieve the best overall test
accuracy of 98\%, ROC-AUC = 0.997, and F1 = 0.987, while MobileNet-V2 provides
an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Grad-CAM
visualizations confirm that the proposed models focus on clinically relevant
lung regions, supporting the use of interpretable AI for radiological
diagnostics. This work highlights the potential of weakly supervised
explainable models that enhance pneumonia screening transparency, and clinical
trust in AI-assisted medical imaging.

geometric priors in the reconstruction stage and self-supervised semantic
priors in the segmentation stage. To address labeled 3D human datasets
scarcity, we further develop an interactive annotation procedure for generating
high-quality data-label pairs. Our pixel-aligned aggregation enables cross-task
synergy, while the multi-task objective simultaneously optimizes texture
modeling fidelity and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that HumanCrafter surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both 3D

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotations for vestibular schwannoma segmentation in MRI are time-consuming but crucial for patient management; existing automated methods lack robustness across diverse datasets.

Method: A bootstrapped deep learning framework with iterative segmentation and quality refinement leveraging expert consensus and data from multiple centers.

Result: The framework enhanced Dice Similarity Coefficient from 0.9125 to 0.9670, maintained stable performance across external datasets, and reduced annotation effort by 37.4%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrated the potential for accurate, resource-efficient, and clinically adaptable automated segmentation in diverse MRI datasets.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vestibular schwannoma (VS) on Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is essential for patient management but often requires
time-intensive manual annotations by experts. While recent advances in deep
learning (DL) have facilitated automated segmentation, challenges remain in
achieving robust performance across diverse datasets and complex clinical
cases. We present an annotated dataset stemming from a bootstrapped DL-based
framework for iterative segmentation and quality refinement of VS in MRI. We
combine data from multiple centres and rely on expert consensus for
trustworthiness of the annotations. We show that our approach enables effective
and resource-efficient generalisation of automated segmentation models to a
target data distribution. The framework achieved a significant improvement in
segmentation accuracy with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) increase from
0.9125 to 0.9670 on our target internal validation dataset, while maintaining
stable performance on representative external datasets. Expert evaluation on
143 scans further highlighted areas for model refinement, revealing nuanced
cases where segmentation required expert intervention. The proposed approach is
estimated to enhance efficiency by approximately 37.4% compared to the
conventional manual annotation process. Overall, our human-in-the-loop model
training approach achieved high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
potential as a clinically adaptable and generalisable strategy for automated VS
segmentation in diverse clinical settings. The dataset includes 190 patients,
with tumour annotations available for 534 longitudinal contrast-enhanced

TL;DR: FedMGP introduces a novel approach for personalized federated prompt learning using diverse prompt groups, achieving superior performance in vision-language benchmarks with a focus on parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve federated prompt learning in vision-language models by addressing the need for capturing diverse, fine-grained semantic cues and achieving a balance between common and client-specific knowledge.

Method: FedMGP uses multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, a diversity loss encouraging specialization, and a dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic sampling for communication.

Result: FedMGP achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalization and domain generalization across federated vision-language benchmarks with the lowest communication parameters among all existing federated prompt learning methods.

Conclusion: FedMGP is an efficient and effective method for personalized federated prompt learning, promoting robust global representation learning and advancing the capabilities of vision-language models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FedMGP, a new paradigm for personalized federated
prompt learning in vision-language models. FedMGP equips each client with
multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, enabling the model to
capture diverse, fine-grained semantic and instance-level cues. A diversity
loss is introduced to drive each prompt group to specialize in distinct and
complementary semantic aspects, ensuring that the groups collectively cover a
broader range of local characteristics. During communication, FedMGP employs a
dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic
sampling: each client computes the cosine similarity between its prompt groups
and the global prompts from the previous round, then samples s groups via a
softmax-weighted distribution. This soft selection mechanism preferentially
aggregates semantically aligned knowledge while still enabling exploration of
underrepresented patterns effectively balancing the preservation of common
knowledge with client-specific features. Notably, FedMGP maintains parameter
efficiency by redistributing a fixed prompt capacity across multiple groups,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest communication parameters
among all federated prompt learning methods. Theoretical analysis shows that
our dynamic aggregation strategy promotes robust global representation learning
by reinforcing shared semantics while suppressing client-specific noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedMGP consistently outperforms prior
approaches in both personalization and domain generalization across diverse
federated vision-language benchmarks. The code will be released on

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of efficiently generating controllable and realistic 4D dynamic scenes from minimal input, combining generative video priors with geometry and motion constraints.

Method: Diff4Splat uses a feed-forward framework with video latent transformers to predict deformable 3D Gaussian fields for appearance, geometry, and motion, trained with objectives for fidelity, accuracy, and consistency.

Result: Diff4Splat achieves high-quality results in video generation, novel view synthesis, and geometry extraction; it matches or surpasses existing optimization-heavy methods while being faster.

Conclusion: The study proves that Diff4Splat is a significant contribution to dynamic scene synthesis, offering efficient and high-quality results without extensive computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce Diff4Splat, a feed-forward method that synthesizes controllable
and explicit 4D scenes from a single image. Our approach unifies the generative
priors of video diffusion models with geometry and motion constraints learned
from large-scale 4D datasets. Given a single input image, a camera trajectory,
and an optional text prompt, Diff4Splat directly predicts a deformable 3D
Gaussian field that encodes appearance, geometry, and motion, all in a single
forward pass, without test-time optimization or post-hoc refinement. At the
core of our framework lies a video latent transformer, which augments video
diffusion models to jointly capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict
time-varying 3D Gaussian primitives. Training is guided by objectives on
appearance fidelity, geometric accuracy, and motion consistency, enabling
Diff4Splat to synthesize high-quality 4D scenes in 30 seconds. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Diff4Splatacross video generation, novel view synthesis,
and geometry extraction, where it matches or surpasses optimization-based

### [189] [OmniTrack++: Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking by Learning Large-FoV Trajectory Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00510)
*Kai Luo,Hao Shi,Kunyu Peng,Fei Teng,Sheng Wu,Kaiwei Wang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniTrack++, an MOT framework tailored for panoramic imagery, addressing challenges like panoramic distortions and identity ambiguity. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic imagery poses unique challenges for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) due to the 360° Field of View, resolution dilution, and severe distortions, which current MOT methods fail to handle effectively.

Method: OmniTrack++ utilizes a feedback-driven framework with components like DynamicSSM for feature stabilization, trajectory-informed FlexiTrack Instances for association, ExpertTrack Memory for long-term track recovery, and adaptive Tracklet Management to balance detection and tracking modes.

Result: OmniTrack++ achieved significant performance improvements, including HOTA gains of +25.5% on JRDB and +43.07% on QuadTrack, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: OmniTrack++ effectively addresses panoramic MOT challenges and sets a new benchmark in performance, supported by the EmboTrack dataset and real-world evaluations.

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in panoramic imagery,
which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV),
resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT
methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily
under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space,
and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a
feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory
cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly
alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations,
FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization
and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an
ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts
design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift.
Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end
and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a
balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous
evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for
panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and
BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets
span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a
challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments
on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and
+43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack. Datasets and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/xifen523/OmniTrack.

### [190] [ID-Composer: Multi-Subject Video Synthesis with Hierarchical Identity Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00511)
*Panwang Pan,Jingjing Zhao,Yuchen Lin,Chenguo Lin,Chenxin Li,Haopeng Li,Honglei Yan,Tingting Shen,Yadong Mu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID-Composer introduces a novel framework for generating multi-subject videos from text prompts and reference images while ensuring identity preservation and semantic integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models lack controllability and applicability when conditioned on multiple subjects. ID-Composer aims to develop a model that addresses these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes a hierarchical identity-preserving attention mechanism, semantic understanding via pretrained vision-language models, and an online reinforcement learning phase to improve video generation.

Result: Experiments show ID-Composer surpasses current methods in identity preservation, semantic alignment, temporal consistency, and overall video quality.

Conclusion: ID-Composer effectively addresses the challenges of multi-subject video generation with innovative mechanisms, demonstrating superior quality and consistency in synthesized videos.

Abstract: Video generative models pretrained on large-scale datasets can produce
high-quality videos, but are often conditioned on text or a single image,
limiting controllability and applicability. We introduce ID-Composer, a novel
framework that addresses this gap by tackling multi-subject video generation
from a text prompt and reference images. This task is challenging as it
requires preserving subject identities, integrating semantics across subjects
and modalities, and maintaining temporal consistency. To faithfully preserve
the subject consistency and textual information in synthesized videos,
ID-Composer designs a \textbf{hierarchical identity-preserving attention
mechanism}, which effectively aggregates features within and across subjects
and modalities. To effectively allow for the semantic following of user
intention, we introduce \textbf{semantic understanding via pretrained
vision-language model (VLM)}, leveraging VLM's superior semantic understanding
to provide fine-grained guidance and capture complex interactions between
multiple subjects. Considering that standard diffusion loss often fails in
aligning the critical concepts like subject ID, we employ an \textbf{online
reinforcement learning phase} to drive the overall training objective of
ID-Composer into RLVR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
surpasses existing methods in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and
video quality.

### [191] [SegDebias: Test-Time Bias Mitigation for ViT-Based CLIP via Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00523)
*Fangyu Wu,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time debiasing method for CLIP-based models to reduce spurious correlations by leveraging pretrained segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods rely on training data and explicit annotations, limiting real-world applicability, while test-time methods often depend on prior bias knowledge, restricting generalizability.

Method: A test-time debiasing method using pretrained segmentation models to isolate target visual attributes and adjust embeddings of non-target regions uniformly across class-specific text prompts, thereby reducing bias signals.

Result: Experiments on datasets like Waterbirds and CelebA show superior group robustness metrics and improved Attention IoU compared to existing test-time debiasing methods.

Conclusion: Segmentation-guided interventions offer a scalable and annotation-free strategy for bias mitigation in vision language models.

Abstract: Vision language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in zero
shot classification, but remain susceptible to spurious correlations, where
irrelevant visual features influence predictions. Existing debiasing methods
often require access to training data and explicit group labels to perform
fine-tuning or adjust embeddings, which limits their practicality in real-world
settings. Test-time methods attempt to avoid this constraint, but many still
depend on prior knowledge of dataset specific biases, limiting their
generalizability in open set settings. In this work, we propose a test-time
debiasing method for ViT based CLIP models that requires no additional training
or assumptions of bias annotations. Our approach uses a pretrained segmentation
model to isolate the target visual attribute, then adjusts the non target
regions so that their embeddings are uniformly similar to all class specific
text prompts. This procedure removes unintended bias signals from confounding
visual regions while preserving the target attribute. Experiments on Waterbirds
and CelebA show that our method outperforms existing test-time debiasing
approaches in both group robustness metrics and Attention IoU. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation guided interventions for scalable
and annotation free bias mitigation in vision language models.

### [192] [Text-guided Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00524)
*Jihao Gu,Kun Li,He Wang,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces T-VAD, a novel framework for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) that provides fine-grained anomaly heatmaps and is text-interactive by leveraging large vision-language models. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying and describing anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods by creating a more detailed and interactive system, as traditional VADs are limited to binary outputs and require human intervention, making them less efficient in scenarios like surveillance and industrial monitoring.

Method: The proposed T-VAD framework uses a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and introduces two key components: 1) Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD) for creating fine-grained, pixel-level anomaly heatmaps through visual-textual alignment, and 2) Region-aware Anomaly Encoder (RAE) that transforms heatmaps into text embeddings to guide the LVLM in identifying and localizing anomalies.

Result: T-VAD achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, with 94.8% AUC and RBDC/TBDC accuracy of 67.8%/76.7% on the UBnormal dataset. It also demonstrated superior textual descriptions on the ShanghaiTech-based dataset with BLEU-4 scores (62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories) and Yes/No accuracy (97.67%), as well as strong performance on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 and 78.10, Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).

Conclusion: T-VAD significantly enhances anomaly detection systems by improving both the granularity of localization and the interactivity with users through its text-guided, fine-grained anomaly detection capabilities, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video
segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring,
anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are
semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional
VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided
Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD)
that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate
fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly
Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings,
guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in
videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of
anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by
demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and
67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset,
and subjectively verified more preferable textual description on the
ShanghaiTech-based dataset (BLEU-4: 62.67 for targets, 88.84 for trajectories;
Yes/No accuracy: 97.67%), and on the UBnormal dataset (BLEU-4: 50.32 for
targets, 78.10 for trajectories; Yes/No accuracy: 89.73%).

TL;DR: The paper introduces Real-IAD Variety, the largest benchmark for Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD), addressing limitations in existing datasets and enabling improved scalability and generalization for anomaly detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Industrial Anomaly Detection lack diversity, scale, and generalization capabilities, limiting advancements in operational safety and manufacturing efficiency.

Method: The authors created Real-IAD Variety with 198,960 high-resolution images across 160 object categories, representing diverse industries, materials, and colors. They conducted experimental analyses comparing anomaly detection methods at varying category scales.

Result: State-of-the-art anomaly detection methods showed significant performance degradation when scaled to 160 categories, while vision-language models demonstrated robust scalability and enhanced generalization.

Conclusion: Real-IAD Variety is an essential resource for advancing research in scalable and general-purpose anomaly detection systems, providing unprecedented scope and complexity for rigorous evaluations in various settings.

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for enhancing operational
safety, ensuring product quality, and optimizing manufacturing efficiency
across global industries. However, the IAD algorithms are severely constrained
by the limitations of existing public benchmarks. Current datasets exhibit
restricted category diversity and insufficient scale, frequently resulting in
metric saturation and limited model transferability to real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce Real-IAD Variety, the largest and most diverse
IAD benchmark, comprising 198,960 high-resolution images across 160 distinct
object categories. Its diversity is ensured through comprehensive coverage of
28 industries, 24 material types, and 22 color variations. Our comprehensive
experimental analysis validates the benchmark's substantial challenge:
state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection methods experience
significant performance degradation when scaled from 30 to 160 categories.
Crucially, we demonstrate that vision-language models exhibit remarkable
robustness to category scale-up, with minimal performance variation across
different category counts, significantly enhancing generalization capabilities
in diverse industrial contexts. The unprecedented scale and complexity of
Real-IAD Variety position it as an essential resource for training and
evaluating next-generation foundation models for anomaly detection. By
providing this comprehensive benchmark with rigorous evaluation protocols
across multi-class unsupervised, multi-view, and zero-/few-shot settings, we
aim to accelerate research beyond domain-specific constraints, enabling the
development of scalable, general-purpose anomaly detection systems. Real-IAD
Variety will be made publicly available to facilitate innovation in this
critical field.

*Kailun Su,Ziqi He,Xi Wang,Yang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for learning and synthesizing multiple semantic instances from a single image using penalty-based attention and box control techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of learning and synthesizing multi-instance semantics from a single image arises from limited training data and similarity in appearance or semantics among instances.

Method: The paper proposes penalty-based attention optimization to improve semantic disentanglement during learning and incorporates box control in attention layers for precise layout synthesis.

Result: Experimental results show that the method achieves high-quality semantic learning and synthesis with strong editability and consistency, even with rare or similar instances.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances instance consistency and editability while demonstrating robustness in semantic learning and synthesis tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for precise learning and synthesizing
multi-instance semantics from a single image. The difficulty of this problem
lies in the limited training data, and it becomes even more challenging when
the instances to be learned have similar semantics or appearance. To address
this, we propose a penalty-based attention optimization to disentangle similar
semantics during the learning stage. Then, in the synthesis, we introduce and
optimize box control in attention layers to further mitigate semantic leakage
while precisely controlling the output layout. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method achieves disentangled and high-quality semantic learning and
synthesis, strikingly balancing editability and instance consistency. Our
method remains robust when dealing with semantically or visually similar
instances or rare-seen objects. The code is publicly available at

*Chun-Tin Wu,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 4D Neural Voxel Splatting (4D-NVS) to improve dynamic scene rendering efficiency while reducing memory and training needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory overhead and efficiency challenges in extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to dynamic scenes.

Method: Instead of using separate Gaussian sets per frame, the method leverages neural voxels and learned deformation fields to handle temporal dynamics compactly while introducing view refinement for specific optimization.

Result: The approach achieves reduced memory consumption, faster training, superior visual fidelity, and outperforms existing methods, enabling real-time rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed 4D-NVS improves dynamic scene representation efficiency by merging voxel-based representations and neural Gaussian splatting, offering better performance and quality in real-time rendering.

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves efficient rendering for novel
view synthesis, extending it to dynamic scenes still results in substantial
memory overhead from replicating Gaussians across frames. To address this
challenge, we propose 4D Neural Voxel Splatting (4D-NVS), which combines
voxel-based representations with neural Gaussian splatting for efficient
dynamic scene modeling. Instead of generating separate Gaussian sets per
timestamp, our method employs a compact set of neural voxels with learned
deformation fields to model temporal dynamics. The design greatly reduces
memory consumption and accelerates training while preserving high image
quality. We further introduce a novel view refinement stage that selectively
improves challenging viewpoints through targeted optimization, maintaining
global efficiency while enhancing rendering quality for difficult viewing
angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches with significant memory reduction and faster training, enabling
real-time rendering with superior visual fidelity.

### [196] [Generalized Category Discovery under Domain Shift: A Frequency Domain Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00573)
*Wei Feng,Zongyuan Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'FREE,' a framework for Generalized Category Discovery under domain shifts, with a focus on clustering unknown categories leveraging frequency-domain information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Generalized Category Discovery struggle to maintain performance under domain distribution shifts. There is a need for robust frameworks to address more realistic scenarios where unlabeled data contains unknown categories from new domains.

Method: The proposed 'FREE' framework utilizes frequency-domain strategies, including domain separation, cross-domain and intra-domain perturbations, extended contrastive objectives, semantic clustering loss, and a resampling technique to focus on challenging categories.

Result: Experimental results show that FREE effectively minimizes the impact of distribution shifts and outperforms existing methods in discovering both known and unknown categories across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The FREE framework demonstrates robust category discovery under challenging domain-shifted conditions, providing a promising tool for handling realistic Generalized Category Discovery scenarios.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to leverage labeled samples from
known categories to cluster unlabeled data that may include both known and
unknown categories. While existing methods have achieved impressive results
under standard conditions, their performance often deteriorates in the presence
of distribution shifts. In this paper, we explore a more realistic task:
Domain-Shifted Generalized Category Discovery (DS\_GCD), where the unlabeled
data includes not only unknown categories but also samples from unknown
domains. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
\textbf{\underline{F}}requency-guided Gene\textbf{\underline{r}}alized
Cat\textbf{\underline{e}}gory Discov\textbf{\underline{e}}ry framework (FREE)
that enhances the model's ability to discover categories under distributional
shift by leveraging frequency-domain information. Specifically, we first
propose a frequency-based domain separation strategy that partitions samples
into known and unknown domains by measuring their amplitude differences. We
then propose two types of frequency-domain perturbation strategies: a
cross-domain strategy, which adapts to new distributions by exchanging
amplitude components across domains, and an intra-domain strategy, which
enhances robustness to intra-domain variations within the unknown domain.
Furthermore, we extend the self-supervised contrastive objective and semantic
clustering loss to better guide the training process. Finally, we introduce a
clustering-difficulty-aware resampling technique to adaptively focus on
harder-to-cluster categories, further enhancing model performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the impact of
distributional shifts across various benchmark datasets and achieves superior
performance in discovering both known and unknown categories.

*Yousuf Ahmed Siddiqui,Sufiyaan Usmani,Umer Tariq,Jawwad Ahmed Shamsi,Muhammad Burhan Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a memory-augmented pipeline for context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection in videos, achieving state-of-the-art results on key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current anomaly detectors fail to consider context-aware signals, limiting their ability to generalize in real-life scenarios.

Method: The approach employs cross-attention to correlate temporal and visual features with textual memory, enabling real-time zero-shot anomaly classification through contextual similarity scoring.

Result: The proposed model achieved 90.4% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset and 83.67% AP on the XD-Violence dataset while maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: By integrating contextual memory and cross-attention mechanisms, the model facilitates accurate and explainable zero-shot anomaly detection, advancing practical applications like surveillance systems.

Abstract: Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal
evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other
context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context,
which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life
situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection
challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by
correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in
real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating
temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time
zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve
90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art
among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high
precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing
cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity
anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in
real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CueBench, a benchmark for context-aware video anomaly understanding (VAU), with a focus on capturing contextual differences and semantics in real-world scenarios. Additionally, it presents Cue-R1, a model achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing VAU methods in understanding complex and subtle anomalies in real-world videos and to enhance anomaly comprehension using context-aware approaches.

Method: The authors developed CueBench, a benchmark with a hierarchical taxonomy focusing on context-aware anomaly detection across various tasks, and introduced the Cue-R1 model employing R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning with task-aligned rewards.

Result: Cue-R1 outperformed state-of-the-art methods by over 24% on average in the CueBench framework, showcasing its improved capability for real-world anomaly understanding.

Conclusion: Current vision-language models are insufficient for comprehensive real-world video anomaly understanding. However, the proposed CueBench and Cue-R1 significantly advance the field by fostering better context-aware anomaly comprehension.

Abstract: How far are deep models from real-world video anomaly understanding (VAU)?
Current works typically emphasize on detecting unexpected occurrences deviated
from normal patterns or comprehending anomalous events with interpretable
descriptions. However, they exhibit only a superficial comprehension of
real-world anomalies, with limited breadth in complex principles and subtle
context that distinguish the anomalies from normalities, e.g., climbing cliffs
with safety gear vs. without it. To this end, we introduce CueBench, the first
of its kind Benchmark, devoted to Context-aware video anomalies within a
Unified Evaluation framework. We comprehensively establish an event-centric
hierarchical taxonomy that anchors two core event types: 14 conditional and 18
absolute anomaly events, defined by their refined semantics from diverse
contexts across 174 scenes and 198 attributes. Based on this, we propose to
unify and benchmark context-aware VAU with various challenging tasks across
recognition, temporal grounding, detection, and anticipation. This also serves
as a rigorous and fair probing evaluation suite for generative-discriminative
as well as generalized-specialized vision-language models (VLMs). To address
the challenges underlying CueBench, we further develop Cue-R1 based on R1-style
reinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable, task-aligned, and hierarchy-refined
rewards in a unified generative manner. Extensive results on CueBench reveal
that, existing VLMs are still far from satisfactory real-world anomaly
understanding, while our Cue-R1 surpasses these state-of-the-art approaches by
over 24% on average.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces triplet segmentation, a method that spatially grounds surgical action triplets using instrument instance segmentation, and proposes TargetFusionNet, which improves accuracy in surgical scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for linking surgical actions with instruments and targets are imprecise, limiting detailed interaction analysis in surgery.

Method: The authors propose a novel dataset, CholecTriplet-Seg, and introduce TargetFusionNet, which incorporates weak anatomy priors fused with instrument instance queries to segment triplets in surgical scenes.

Result: TargetFusionNet demonstrates improved performance in metrics such as recognition, detection, and segmentation compared to current baselines, and provides robust surgical action analysis.

Conclusion: The new triplet segmentation framework and TargetFusionNet enhance surgical scene understanding, paving the way for more interpretable research and applications in instrument-tissue interaction analysis.

Abstract: Understanding surgical instrument-tissue interactions requires not only
identifying which instrument performs which action on which anatomical target,
but also grounding these interactions spatially within the surgical scene.
Existing surgical action triplet recognition methods are limited to learning
from frame-level classification, failing to reliably link actions to specific
instrument instances.Previous attempts at spatial grounding have primarily
relied on class activation maps, which lack the precision and robustness
required for detailed instrument-tissue interaction analysis.To address this
gap, we propose grounding surgical action triplets with instrument instance
segmentation, or triplet segmentation for short, a new unified task which
produces spatially grounded <instrument, verb, target> outputs.We start by
presenting CholecTriplet-Seg, a large-scale dataset containing over 30,000
annotated frames, linking instrument instance masks with action verb and
anatomical target annotations, and establishing the first benchmark for
strongly supervised, instance-level triplet grounding and evaluation.To learn
triplet segmentation, we propose TargetFusionNet, a novel architecture that
extends Mask2Former with a target-aware fusion mechanism to address the
challenge of accurate anatomical target prediction by fusing weak anatomy
priors with instrument instance queries.Evaluated across recognition,
detection, and triplet segmentation metrics, TargetFusionNet consistently
improves performance over existing baselines, demonstrating that strong
instance supervision combined with weak target priors significantly enhances
the accuracy and robustness of surgical action understanding.Triplet
segmentation establishes a unified framework for spatially grounding surgical
action triplets. The proposed benchmark and architecture pave the way for more
interpretable, surgical scene understanding.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: AeroResQ is an edge-accelerated UAV framework for real-time wildfire response, focusing on scalable and collaborative escape route planning. It utilizes specialized drones and advanced algorithms for efficient monitoring and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for real-time, scalable, and resilient systems that enable safe and efficient evacuation and firefighter coordination during wildfires.

Method: AeroResQ employs a multi-layer architecture of service drones (SDs) and coordinator drones (CDs), utilizing edge accelerators, DNN models, and IoTDB for efficient decision-making. A weighted A* algorithm is used for escape route planning.

Result: AeroResQ shows latency below 500ms, high task reassignment success (over 98%), and feasibility for real-time deployment in wildfire scenarios.

Conclusion: AeroResQ is an effective tool for improving emergency response times and ensuring firefighter and civilian safety in wildfire situations, validated through realistic experimental setups.

Abstract: Drone fleets equipped with onboard cameras, computer vision, and Deep Neural
Network (DNN) models present a powerful paradigm for real-time spatio-temporal
decision-making. In wildfire response, such drones play a pivotal role in
monitoring fire dynamics, supporting firefighter coordination, and facilitating
safe evacuation. In this paper, we introduce AeroResQ, an edge-accelerated UAV
framework designed for scalable, resilient, and collaborative escape route
planning during wildfire scenarios. AeroResQ adopts a multi-layer orchestration
architecture comprising service drones (SDs) and coordinator drones (CDs), each
performing specialized roles. SDs survey fire-affected areas, detect stranded
individuals using onboard edge accelerators running fire detection and human
pose identification DNN models, and issue requests for assistance. CDs,
equipped with lightweight data stores such as Apache IoTDB, dynamically
generate optimal ground escape routes and monitor firefighter movements along
these routes. The framework proposes a collaborative path-planning approach
based on a weighted A* search algorithm, where CDs compute context-aware escape
paths. AeroResQ further incorporates intelligent load-balancing and resilience
mechanisms: CD failures trigger automated data redistribution across IoTDB
replicas, while SD failures initiate geo-fenced re-partitioning and
reassignment of spatial workloads to operational SDs. We evaluate AeroResQ
using realistic wildfire emulated setup modeled on recent Southern California
wildfires. Experimental results demonstrate that AeroResQ achieves a nominal
end-to-end latency of <=500ms, much below the 2s request interval, while
maintaining over 98% successful task reassignment and completion, underscoring
its feasibility for real-time, on-field deployment in emergency response and
firefighter safety operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of COOL in synchronous settings and adapt it for asynchronous environments, enabling secure and efficient Byzantine Agreement with optimal resilience.

Method: The paper modifies the COOL protocol to operate in asynchronous settings (OciorACOOL) by leveraging error correction techniques with $k=t/3$ and a single invocation of an asynchronous binary BA protocol, maintaining low communication complexity.

Result: OciorACOOL achieves error-free, information-theoretically secure BA consensus in asynchronous settings with communication complexity of $O(\max\{n\ell, n t \log q\})$, $O(1)$ rounds, and retains optimal resilience ($n \geq 3t+1$).

Conclusion: OciorACOOL maintains the theoretical efficiency and resilience of COOL while extending applicability to asynchronous communication settings, demonstrating its robustness and practicality.

Abstract: COOL (Chen'21) is an error-free, information-theoretically secure Byzantine
agreement (BA) protocol proven to achieve BA consensus in the synchronous

case, and a single invocation of a binary BA, under the optimal resilience
assumption $n \geq 3t + 1$ in a network of $n$ nodes, where up to $t$ nodes may
behave dishonestly. Here, $q$ denotes the alphabet size of the error correction

  In this work, we present an adaptive variant of COOL, called OciorACOOL,
which achieves error-free, information-theoretically secure BA consensus in the
asynchronous setting with total $O(\max\{n\ell, n t \log q\})$ communication
bits, $O(1)$ rounds, and a single invocation of an asynchronous binary BA
protocol, still under the optimal resilience assumption $n \geq 3t + 1$.
Moreover, OciorACOOL retains the same low-complexity, traditional $(n, k)$
error-correction encoding and decoding as COOL, with $k=t/3$.

*Lucas Almeida,Maycon Peixoto*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tetris, a heuristic application placement strategy for Edge-Cloud Continuum environments, prioritizing SLA and resource efficiency to reduce latency and improve QoS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of strategically placing application modules in Edge-Cloud Continuum infrastructures, minimizing latency while meeting SLAs and maximizing resource use.

Method: The study proposes Tetris, a heuristic algorithm-based application placement strategy focusing on resource efficiency and SLA urgency to strategically allocate computational services across edge and cloud.

Result: Tetris reduces SLA violations by approximately 76% compared to baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in improving resource use and QoS.

Conclusion: Tetris demonstrates its capability to enhance application placement in Edge-Cloud Continuum systems, effectively reducing latency and SLA violations, and improving user experience.

Abstract: An Edge-Cloud Continuum integrates edge and cloud resources to provide a
flexible and scalable infrastructure. This paradigm can minimize latency by
processing data closer to the source at the edge while leveraging the vast
computational power of the cloud for more intensive tasks. In this context,
module application placement requires strategic allocation plans that align
user demands with infrastructure constraints, aiming for efficient resource
use. Therefore, we propose Tetris, an application placement strategy that
utilizes a heuristic algorithm to distribute computational services across edge
and cloud resources efficiently. Tetris prioritizes services based on SLA
urgencies and resource efficiency to avoid system overloading. Our results
demonstrate that Tetris reduces SLA violations by approximately 76% compared to
the baseline method, which serves as a reference point for benchmarking
performance in this scenario. Therefore, Tetris offers an effective placement
approach for managing latency-sensitive applications in Edge-Cloud Continuum
environments, enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) for users.

*Yubo Wang,Yubo Cui,Tuo Shi,Danyang Li,Wenxin Li,Lide Suo,Tao Wang,Xin Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EPARA enhances edge AI inference by categorizing tasks based on latency and GPU needs, achieving 2.1x higher goodput than other frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address rising computational demands from AI applications in edge clouds and to optimize task processing capabilities using existing hardware.

Method: EPARA employs task categorization based on latency and GPU needs, using three core components: a parallelism allocator, a distributed request handler, and a state-aware scheduler.

Result: EPARA outperforms prior frameworks with up to 2.1x higher goodput in tests involving real-world edge AI tasks.

Conclusion: EPARA demonstrates significant improvements in edge AI serving, effectively optimizing task allocation and resource usage for various AI inference tasks.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of AI applications such as large language models
and computer vision AI, the computational demands on AI inference systems are
continuously rising, making the enhancement of task processing capacity using
existing hardware a primary objective in edge clouds. We propose EPARA, an
end-to-end AI parallel inference framework in edge, aimed at enhancing the edge
AI serving capability. Our key idea is to categorize tasks based on their
sensitivity to latency/frequency and requirement for GPU resources, thereby
achieving both request-level and service-level task-resource allocation. EPARA
consists of three core components: 1) a task-categorized parallelism allocator
that decides the parallel mode of each task, 2) a distributed request handler
that performs the calculation for the specific request, and 3) a state-aware
scheduler that periodically updates service placement in edge clouds. We
implement a EPARA prototype and conduct a case study on the EPARA operation for
LLMs and segmentation tasks. Evaluation through testbed experiments involving
edge servers, embedded devices, and microcomputers shows that EPARA achieves up
to 2.1$\times$ higher goodput in production workloads compared to prior
frameworks, while adapting to various edge AI inference tasks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance and scalability of the SERGHEI-SWE shallow water equations solver on four HPC systems, analyzing memory bandwidth bottlenecks and suggesting optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by climate change and the demand for high-resolution, real-time hydrological simulations, the study aims to leverage advanced HPC systems and performance portable frameworks for enhancing computational capabilities.

Method: The study analyzes the performance of the SERGHEI-SWE code across four cutting-edge heterogeneous HPC systems, conducting strong and weak scaling tests, roofline analysis, and performance portability evaluations using various metrics.

Result: The solver demonstrates consistent scalability up to 2048 GPUs, achieving a speedup of 32 and efficiency above 90%. Memory bandwidth is identified as a bottleneck, while performance portability is achieved but could be further improved through architecture-specific optimizations.

Conclusion: SERGHEI-SWE is a scalable and portable tool for large-scale geophysical applications. While it performs well across different HPC systems, kernel optimizations remain necessary to further enhance its capabilities on modern architectures.

Abstract: Current climate change has posed a grand challenge in the field of numerical
modeling due to its complex, multiscale dynamics. In hydrological modeling, the
increasing demand for high-resolution, real-time simulations has led to the
adoption of GPU-accelerated platforms and performance portable programming
frameworks such as Kokkos. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance
study of the SERGHEI-SWE solver, a shallow water equations code, across four
state-of-the-art heterogeneous HPC systems: Frontier (AMD MI250X), JUWELS
Booster (NVIDIA A100), JEDI (NVIDIA H100), and Aurora (Intel Max 1550). We
assess strong scaling up to 1024 GPUs and weak scaling upwards of 2048 GPUs,
demonstrating consistent scalability with a speedup of 32 and an efficiency
upwards of 90\% for most almost all the test range. Roofline analysis reveals
that memory bandwidth is the dominant performance bottleneck, with key solver
kernels residing in the memory-bound region. To evaluate performance
portability, we apply both harmonic and arithmetic mean-based metrics while
varying problem size. Results indicate that while SERGHEI-SWE achieves
portability across devices with tuned problem sizes (<70\%), there is room for
kernel optimization within the solver with more granular control of the
architecture specifically by using Kokkos teams and architecture specific
tunable parameters. These findings position SERGHEI-SWE as a robust, scalable,
and portable simulation tool for large-scale geophysical applications under
evolving HPC architectures with potential to enhance its performance.

*Ran Yan,Youhe Jiang,Tianyuan Wu,Jiaxuan Gao,Zhiyu Mei,Wei Fu,Haohui Mai,Wei Wang,Yi Wu,Binhang Yuan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents AReaL-Hex, a system optimizing asynchronous RL workloads on heterogeneous GPUs for large language models, improving throughput and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize RL for large language models, enhancing training throughput and cost-efficiency is crucial, particularly by leveraging heterogeneous GPUs.

Method: The paper introduces AReaL-Hex, using a two-phase scheduler: mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for workload assignment and graph-partitioning for resource allocation, built on an asynchronous RL framework.

Result: AReaL-Hex achieves up to 1.50x higher throughput and up to 1.46x reduction in training costs compared to state-of-the-art systems under equivalent budgets and outputs.

Conclusion: Deploying heterogeneous GPUs with AReaL-Hex improves resource efficiency and scalability in RL training for large language models, offering practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Maximizing training throughput and cost-efficiency of RL for LLMs is
essential to democratize this advanced technique. One promising but challenging
approach is to deploy such a computational workflow over heterogeneous GPUs.
Unlike conventional large-scale LLM pretraining, RL training generally
decomposes into three coupled stages, i.e., rollout generation, reward
computation, and policy/value updates, which exhibit markedly different compute
intensities, memory footprints, and communication patterns. Recent research
shows that fully asynchronous RL training can disaggregate these stages across
disjoint hardware pools without sacrificing training stability, creating a
great opportunity for real-world heterogeneous deployment. To this end, we
present AReaL-Hex, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous RL training system that
effectively schedules how to execute rollout generation and policy model
training over heterogeneous GPUs while enforcing data staleness bounds.
Concretely, we use a two-phase scheduler: (i) a constrained search with MILP to
select per-stage parallelization strategies and workload assignments given a
resource budget, and (ii) a graph-partitioning step that allocates
heterogeneous GPUs and interconnects to maximize end-to-end throughput. Built
atop a fully asynchronous RL architecture, AReaL-Hex maps HBM-I/O-bound
generation and compute-bound optimization to more cost-efficient resources and
balances their producer-consumer interactions to avoid both idleness and stale
rollout trajectories. On the mathematical reasoning task with various model
scales (1.5B, 7B, and 14B), compared to homogeneous deployments of
state-of-the-art asynchronous RL systems: (i) When maintaining the same total
budgets, AReaL-Hex delivers up to 1.50x higher training throughput; (ii) When
achieving the same training throughput, AReaL-Hex results in up to 1.46x
reduction in training cost.

*Xuan He,Zequan Fang,Jinzhao Lian,Danny H. K. Tsang,Baosen Zhang,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes FREESH, a system to optimize LLM serving systems on heterogeneous GPU clusters, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions while improving fairness and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computation and energy demand for LLMs necessitate more efficient serving systems, especially considering geographic and temporal variations in energy emissions and GPU capabilities.

Method: The authors introduce FREESH, which leverages spatiotemporal flexibility to balance query loads, match GPU capabilities with workload demands, optimize routing and scheduling, and dynamically scale GPU frequency.

Result: FREESH reduces energy use by 28.6% and lowers emissions by 45.45% during a 1-hour test on production workloads, while also improving Service Level Objective (SLO) attainment and fairness.

Conclusion: FREESH offers a holistic optimization framework for LLM serving systems, significantly enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability without compromising service quality.

Abstract: The ever-increasing computation and energy demand for LLM and AI agents call
for holistic and efficient optimization of LLM serving systems. In practice,
heterogeneous GPU clusters can be deployed in a geographically distributed
manner, while LLM load also observes diversity in terms of both query traffic
and serving patterns. LLM queries running on advanced GPUs during a
high-emission hour at one location can lead to significantly higher carbon
footprints versus same queries running on mid-level GPUs at a low-emission time
and location. By observing LLM serving requirements and leveraging
spatiotemporal computation flexibility, we consider the joint routing and
scheduling problem, and propose FREESH to cooperatively run a group of data
centers while minimizing user-specified carbon or energy objectives. FREESH
identifies the optimal configurations of balanced load serving by matching
distinct GPU instance's power-throughput characteristics with predictable LLM
query length and workloads. To ensure both latency and fairness requirements,
FREESH identifies optimized parallelism and query routing schedules together
with dynamic GPU frequency scaling for power saving, and Least-Laxity-First
(LLF) serving strategy for query scheduling. During the 1-hour serving on
production workloads, FREESH reduces energy by 28.6% and emissions by 45.45%
together with improvements in SLO attainment and fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task offloading techniques face challenges in dynamic, resource-constrained environments due to reliance on static heuristics or demanding machine learning models.

Method: The framework integrates a Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)-based decision module into edge nodes for real-time, energy-efficient task orchestration, evaluated using hybrid simulations with YAFS and Brian2.

Result: The SNN-based framework reduces latency by up to 26%, energy consumption by 32%, and increases task success rate by 25% under high-load scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed SNN-based system significantly optimizes task processing and orchestration in edge computing, offering substantial benefits over traditional methods in challenging environments.

Abstract: Traditional task offloading strategies in edge computing often rely on static
heuristics or data-intensive machine learning models, which are not always
suitable for highly dynamic and resource-constrained environments. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-offloading framework based on Spiking Neural
Networks inspired by the efficiency and adaptability of biological neural
systems. Our approach integrates an SNN-based decision module into edge nodes
to perform real-time, energy-efficient task orchestration. We evaluate the
model under various IoT workload scenarios using a hybrid simulation
environment composed of YAFS and Brian2. The results demonstrate that our
SNN-based framework significantly reduces task processing latency and energy
consumption while improving task success rates. Compared to traditional
heuristic and ML-based strategies, our model achieves up to 26% lower latency,
32% less energy consumption, and 25\% higher success rate under high-load
conditions.

*Shruthi Kannappan,Ashwina Kumar,Rupesh Nasre*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPU-parallel algorithms for solving the Maximum Flow problem, including an efficient method for dynamic graphs and optimizations for CUDA implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently solve the Max-Flow problem using GPUs, addressing scenarios with dynamic graph updates and improving computational performance.

Method: Developed a novel GPU-parallel algorithm for dynamic graph updates and a high-performance static algorithm, with CUDA-specific optimizations.

Result: Enhanced scalability, performance, and memory efficiency of Max-Flow computation on GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms and CUDA optimizations are effective for both static and dynamic Max-Flow problems on GPU platforms.

Abstract: The Maximum Flow (Max-Flow) problem is a cornerstone in graph theory and
combinatorial optimization, aiming to determine the largest possible flow from
a designated source node to a sink node within a capacitated flow network. It
has extensive applications across diverse domains such as computer networking,
transportation systems, and image segmentation. The objective is to maximize
the total throughput while respecting edge capacity constraints and maintaining
flow conservation at all intermediate vertices.
  Among the various algorithms proposed for solving the Max-Flow problem, the
Push--Relabel algorithm is particularly notable for its efficiency and
suitability for parallelization, owing to its localized vertex-based
operations. This property has motivated extensive research into GPU-accelerated
Max-Flow computation, leveraging the high degree of parallelism inherent to
modern GPU architectures.
  In this paper, we present a novel GPU-parallel Max-Flow algorithm capable of
incrementally recomputing the maximum flow of a dynamic graph following a batch
of edge updates. In addition, we introduce a high-performance static GPU
algorithm designed for efficiently computing the initial Max-Flow on static
graphs. We further describe a series of CUDA-specific implementation
optimizations that enhance performance, scalability, and memory efficiency on
GPU platforms.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance optimization of nonlinear optical crystals using a hybrid algorithm with GPU parallel acceleration, improving efficiency and accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in optimizing the performance of aperiodically polarized crystals, which involves solving an NP-hard problem and limitations of traditional and heuristic algorithms.

Method: It proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm combining differential evolution (DE) for global search and gray wolf optimization (GWO) for local search, combined with GPU parallel acceleration.

Result: The hybrid scheme enhances optimization efficiency by hundreds to thousands times compared to CPU serial computation, achieving improved crystal domain control accuracy and quasi-phase matching design.

Conclusion: The approach advances the design of nonlinear optical devices and enables breakthroughs in performance and industrial applications in areas like quantum optics and laser processing.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the key problem in the development of nonlinear optical
technology, the performance optimization of aperiodically polarized crystals.
The performance of the crystal depends on the precise control of the micro
distribution of crystal domains, but its optimization belongs to the
high-dimensional discrete combination "NP hard" problem. The traditional
algorithm has the bottleneck of slow convergence and easy to fall into local
optimization, while the heuristic methods such as genetic algorithm are limited
by the CPU serial calculation and inefficient. In order to solve the above
challenges, this paper proposes the fusion scheme of hwsda hybrid optimization
algorithm and GPU parallel acceleration technology: the differential evolution
algorithm (DE) is used to realize the global search, and the gray wolf
optimization algorithm (GWO) is used to strengthen the local search and
convergence speed, and the two coordinate to balance the global and local
optimization requirements; At the same time, it relies on GPU multi-core
architecture to realize thread level parallel computing and improve
optimization efficiency. This scheme effectively breaks through the
optimization problem of high-dimensional discrete space, improves the accuracy
of crystal domain control, improves the efficiency of quasi phase matching
design by hundreds to thousands of times compared with traditional CPU serial
computing, provides a new paradigm for the design of complex nonlinear optical
devices, and helps promote the performance breakthrough and industrial
application of related devices in the fields of quantum optics and laser
processing.

*Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin,Muhammad Umer,Ahsan Bilal,Hassan Rizwan,Sagnik Bhattacharya,Muhammad Ali Jamshed,John M. Cioffi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pilot-aided Flash-Attention Transformer framework to effectively estimate Channel State Information (CSI) in dynamic wireless conditions, achieving superior performance and reduced overhead compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in accurately estimating CSI in non-stationary wireless environments, which involve rapid changes in channel statistics due to mobility, Doppler spread, and multipath effects.

Method: The paper proposes a Flash-Attention Transformer framework integrating model-driven pilot acquisition with data-driven CSI reconstruction using patch-wise self-attention and a physics-aware loss function.

Result: The framework shows approximately 13 dB improvement in phase-invariant NMSE and significantly lower BER compared to baseline methods, while reducing pilot overhead by 16 times under a 3GPP NR configuration.

Conclusion: Attention-based architectures like the proposed framework can reliably recover CSI, enhance spectral efficiency, and minimize estimation overhead, resolving key challenges in adaptive low-overhead channel estimation for next-gen wireless systems.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient estimation of Channel State Information (CSI) is
critical for next-generation wireless systems operating under non-stationary
conditions, where user mobility, Doppler spread, and multipath dynamics rapidly
alter channel statistics. Conventional pilot aided estimators incur substantial
overhead, while deep learning approaches degrade under dynamic pilot patterns
and time varying fading. This paper presents a pilot-aided Flash-Attention
Transformer framework that unifies model-driven pilot acquisition with data
driven CSI reconstruction through patch-wise self-attention and a physics aware
composite loss function enforcing phase alignment, correlation consistency, and
time frequency smoothness. Under a standardized 3GPP NR configuration, the
proposed framework outperforms LMMSE and LSTM baselines by approximately 13 dB
in phase invariant normalized mean-square error (NMSE) with markedly lower
bit-error rate (BER), while reducing pilot overhead by 16 times. These results
demonstrate that attention based architectures enable reliable CSI recovery and
enhanced spectral efficiency without compromising link quality, addressing a
fundamental bottleneck in adaptive, low-overhead channel estimation for
non-stationary 5G and beyond-5G networks.

### [211] [Gradient Clock Synchronization with Practically Constant Local Skew](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01420)
*Christoph Lenzen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper refines the model and analysis for Gradient Clock Synchronization, providing improved bounds on clock skew in networks by addressing short-term stability of measurement and frequency errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses practical shortcomings in clock synchronization methods caused by overly pessimistic assumptions about measurement and frequency stability.

Method: Novel analysis of existing Gradient Clock Synchronization techniques to focus on short-term stability of errors rather than worst-case lifetime bounds.

Result: The paper achieves improved skew bounds, breaking established lower bounds under general conditions, and ensures self-stabilization in networks.

Conclusion: Refining assumptions around error stability in clock synchronization leads to significant practical improvements in skew bounds and self-stabilization while extending results to external synchronization scenarios.

Abstract: Gradient Clock Synchronization (GCS) is the task of minimizing the local
skew, i.e., the clock offset between neighboring clocks, in a larger network.
While asymptotically optimal bounds are known, from a practical perspective
they have crucial shortcomings:
  - Local skew bounds are determined by upper bounds on offset estimation that
need to be guaranteed throughout the entire lifetime of the system.
  - Worst-case frequency deviations of local oscillators from their nominal
rate are assumed, yet frequencies tend to be much more stable in the (relevant)
short term.
  State-of-the-art deployed synchronization methods adapt to the true offset
measurement and frequency errors, but achieve no non-trivial guarantees on the
local skew.
  In this work, we provide a refined model and novel analysis of existing
techniques for solving GCS in this model. By requiring only stability of
measurement and frequency errors, we can circumvent existing lower bounds,
leading to dramatic improvements under very general conditions. For example, if
links exhibit a uniform worst-case estimation error of $\Delta$ and a change in
estimation errors of $\delta\ll \Delta$ on relevant time scales, we bound the
local skew by $O(\Delta+\delta \log D)$ for networks of diameter $D$,
effectively ``breaking'' the established $\Omega(\Delta\log D)$ lower bound,
which holds when $\delta=\Delta$. Similarly, we show how to limit the influence
of local oscillators on $\delta$ to scale with the change of frequency of an
individual oscillator on relevant time scales, rather than a worst-case bound
over all oscillators and the lifetime of the system.
  Moreover, we show how to ensure self-stabilization in this challenging
setting. Last, but not least, we extend all of our results to the scenario of
external synchronization, at the cost of a limited increase in stabilization
time.

*Melanie Tonarelli,Simone Riva,Pietro Benedusi,Fabrizio Ferrandi,Rolf Krause*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A distributed method for multidimensional integration using GPUs was introduced, focusing on adaptive quadrature and load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and robustness in multidimensional integration tasks on GPUs, addressing load balancing and computational challenges.

Method: Hierarchical domain decomposition with adaptive refinement guided by local error estimators, utilizing decentralized load redistribution via CUDA-aware MPI.

Result: Significant load imbalance challenges were mitigated, leading to enhanced performance in high dimensions and improved handling of integrand regularity and accuracy requirements.

Conclusion: The new adaptive quadrature method demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness compared to existing GPU integration packages.

Abstract: We introduce a distributed adaptive quadrature method that formulates
multidimensional integration as a hierarchical domain decomposition problem on
multi-GPU architectures. The integration domain is recursively partitioned into
subdomains whose refinement is guided by local error estimators. Each subdomain
evolves independently on a GPU, which exposes a significant load imbalance as
the adaptive process progresses. To address this challenge, we introduce a
decentralised load redistribution schemes based on a cyclic round-robin policy.
This strategy dynamically rebalance subdomains across devices through
non-blocking, CUDA-aware MPI communication that overlaps with computation. The
proposed strategy has two main advantages compared to a state-of-the-art
GPU-tailored package: higher efficiency in high dimensions; and improved
robustness w.r.t the integrand regularity and the target accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LARK is a synchronous replication protocol designed to achieve linearizability with minimal latency and infrastructure cost, offering higher availability compared to traditional consensus methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional quorum-log consensus protocols like Raft and Paxos, aiming for improved availability, reduced latency, and cost-efficiency in distributed databases.

Method: LARK introduces Partition Availability Conditions (PAC), eliminating ordered logs and enabling efficient handling of partition readiness and failure tolerance, even under limited storage budgets.

Result: LARK demonstrates approximately 3x better availability under single failure tolerance and 10x under two failures, while maintaining efficiency in leader transitions and rolling restarts.

Conclusion: LARK achieves significant advancements in availability, safety, and efficiency for replicated databases, validated through formal safety arguments, specifications, and experimental analysis.

Abstract: We present LARK (Linearizability Algorithms for Replicated Keys), a
synchronous replication protocol that achieves linearizability while minimizing
latency and infrastructure cost, at significantly higher availability than
traditional quorum-log consensus. LARK introduces Partition Availability
Conditions (PAC) that reason over the entire database cluster rather than fixed
replica sets, improving partition availability under independent failures by
roughly 3x when tolerating one failure and 10x when tolerating two. Unlike
Raft, Paxos, and Viewstamped Replication, LARK eliminates ordered logs,
enabling immediate partition readiness after leader changes -- with at most a
per-key duplicate-resolution round trip when the new leader lacks the latest
copy. Under equal storage budgets -- where both systems maintain only f+1 data
copies to tolerate f failures -- LARK continues committing through data-node
failures while log-based protocols must pause commits for replica rebuilding.
These properties also enable zero-downtime rolling restarts even when
maintaining only two copies. We provide formal safety arguments and a TLA+
specification, and we demonstrate through analysis and experiments that LARK
achieves significant availability gains.

*Yurun Wu,Yousong Sun,Burkhard Wunsche,Jia Wang,Elliott Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VRScout introduces a deep learning agent designed for automated testing in VR environments, achieving expert-level performance and real-time operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human-based quality assurance struggles to scale with VR content's complexity and rapid growth, necessitating automated testing solutions.

Method: Using an Action Chunking Transformer trained on human demonstrations, VRScout predicts multi-step strategies and adapts temporal context dynamically.

Result: VRScout performs at expert levels on commercial VR games with minimal training data, maintaining real-time speeds on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: VRScout offers a scalable, efficient framework for VR game testing, enhancing quality assurance and safety auditing.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has rapidly become a mainstream platform for gaming and
interactive experiences, yet ensuring the quality, safety, and appropriateness
of VR content remains a pressing challenge. Traditional human-based quality
assurance is labor-intensive and cannot scale with the industry's rapid growth.
While automated testing has been applied to traditional 2D and 3D games,
extending it to VR introduces unique difficulties due to high-dimensional
sensory inputs and strict real-time performance requirements. We present
VRScout, a deep learning-based agent capable of autonomously navigating VR
environments and interacting with virtual objects in a human-like and real-time
manner. VRScout learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action
Chunking Transformer that predicts multi-step action sequences. This enables
our agent to capture higher-level strategies and generalize across diverse
environments. To balance responsiveness and precision, we introduce a
dynamically adjustable sliding horizon that adapts the agent's temporal context
at runtime. We evaluate VRScout on commercial VR titles and show that it
achieves expert-level performance with only limited training data, while
maintaining real-time inference at 60 FPS on consumer-grade hardware. These
results position VRScout as a practical and scalable framework for automated VR
game testing, with direct applications in both quality assurance and safety
auditing.

*Samaksh Bhargav,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve safety and utility in LLMs using Sparse Auto Encoders (SAEs) for feature selection and steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs safely requires avoiding unsafe responses while maintaining compliance with safe prompts, but previous methods are costly and inefficient.

Method: The authors use Sparse Auto Encoders (SAEs) for interpretable feature extraction and propose a systematic feature selection method employing contrasting prompts and datasets for optimal steering.

Result: The approach achieves an 18.9% improvement in safety and an 11.1% increase in utility on the Llama-3 8B model.

Conclusion: Targeted SAE steering with optimal feature selection can effectively balance safety and utility, improving both simultaneously.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) deployment requires guiding the LLM to recognize
and not answer unsafe prompts while complying with safe prompts. Previous
methods for achieving this require adjusting model weights along with other
expensive procedures. While recent advances in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled interpretable feature extraction from LLMs, existing approaches lack
systematic feature selection methods and principled evaluation of
safety-utility tradeoffs. We explored using different steering features and
steering strengths using Sparse Auto Encoders (SAEs) to provide a solution.
Using an accurate and innovative contrasting prompt method with the
AI-Generated Prompts Dataset from teknium/OpenHermes-2p5-Mistral-7B and Air
Bench eu-dataset to efficiently choose the best features in the model to steer,
we tested this method on Llama-3 8B. We conclude that using this method, our
approach achieves an 18.9% improvement in safety performance while
simultaneously increasing utility by 11.1%, demonstrating that targeted SAE
steering can overcome traditional safety-utility tradeoffs when optimal
features are identified through principled selection methods.

Motivation: Machine unlearning aims to selectively eliminate specific information from pre-trained models without needing full retraining, addressing ethical and regulatory challenges.

Method: The authors introduce a test case generation framework to investigate unintended losses of knowledge caused by unlearning, targeting areas adjacent to the removed content and identifying potential broader failures.

Result: Up to 98.7% of generated test cases exposed irrelevant or nonsensical responses in unlearned models, highlighting significant knowledge preservation issues compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarks for evaluating unlearning may overlook critical unintended side effects. A new evaluation approach is necessary to better assess knowledge retention and preservation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning has emerged as a prevalent technical solution for
selectively removing unwanted knowledge absorbed during pre-training, without
requiring full retraining. While recent unlearning techniques can effectively
remove undesirable content without severely compromising performance on
standard benchmarks, we find that they may inadvertently create ``knowledge
holes'' -- unintended losses of benign knowledge that standard benchmarks fail
to capture. To probe where unlearned models reveal knowledge holes, we propose
a test case generation framework that explores both immediate neighbors of
unlearned content and broader areas of potential failures. Our evaluation
demonstrates significant hidden costs of unlearning: up to 98.7\% of the test
cases yield irrelevant or nonsensical responses from unlearned models, despite
being answerable by the pretrained model. These findings necessitate rethinking
the conventional approach to evaluating knowledge preservation in unlearning,
moving beyond standard, static benchmarks.

### [217] [From Uniform to Adaptive: General Skip-Block Mechanisms for Efficient PDE Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00032)
*Lei Liu,Zhongyi Yu,Hong Wang,Huanshuo Dong,Haiyang Xin,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Skip-Block Routing (SBR), a framework designed for Transformer-based neural operators to enhance computational efficiency in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators are promising for PDEs but inefficient in dealing with fields of varying complexity, such as turbulence flows.

Method: SBR uses a routing mechanism to rank token complexity and selectively process tokens in later layers, optimizing resource allocation.

Result: SBR reduces computational cost by ~50% (FLOPs) and achieves up to 2x faster inference speed without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Skip-Block Routing is a general solution that integrates well into neural operators, optimizing performance and efficiency for PDE-related tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Operators(NO) have gradually emerged as a popular
approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, their
application to large-scale engineering tasks suffers from significant
computational overhead. And the fact that current models impose a uniform
computational cost while physical fields exhibit vastly different complexities
constitutes a fundamental mismatch, which is the root of this inefficiency. For
instance, in turbulence flows, intricate vortex regions require deeper network
processing compared to stable flows. To address this, we introduce a framework:
Skip-Block Routing (SBR), a general framework designed for Transformer-based
neural operators, capable of being integrated into their multi-layer
architectures. First, SBR uses a routing mechanism to learn the complexity and
ranking of tokens, which is then applied during inference. Then, in later
layers, it decides how many tokens are passed forward based on this ranking.
This way, the model focuses more processing capacity on the tokens that are
more complex. Experiments demonstrate that SBR is a general framework that
seamlessly integrates into various neural operators. Our method reduces
computational cost by approximately 50% in terms of Floating Point Operations
(FLOPs), while still delivering up to 2x faster inference without sacrificing
accuracy.

*Georg Velev,Stefan Lessmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based approach for automated model discovery in energy generation forecasting, emphasizing computational efficiency, accuracy, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for timely and precise energy generation forecasting under operational constraints, minimizing human error in configuring complex models and handling the challenges of temporal dynamics and generalization to unseen data.

Method: A neural architecture search (NAS)-based framework with an efficient component-focused search space and a novel objective function, emphasizing temporal generalization and exploration of high-dimensional search spaces, is proposed.

Result: The proposed method achieved superior efficiency and accuracy in multi-step energy forecasting compared to state-of-the-art techniques, including Transformers and pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that NAS-discovered lightweight ensemble architectures are effective and efficient for energy time series forecasting, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The dynamic energy sector requires both predictive accuracy and runtime
efficiency for short-term forecasting of energy generation under operational
constraints, where timely and precise predictions are crucial. The manual
configuration of complex methods, which can generate accurate global multi-step
predictions without suffering from a computational bottleneck, represents a
procedure with significant time requirements and high risk for human-made
errors. A further intricacy arises from the temporal dynamics present in
energy-related data. Additionally, the generalization to unseen data is
imperative for continuously deploying forecasting techniques over time. To
overcome these challenges, in this research, we design a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based framework for the automated discovery of time series models
that strike a balance between computational efficiency, predictive performance,
and generalization power for the global, multi-step short-term forecasting of
energy production time series. In particular, we introduce a search space
consisting only of efficient components, which can capture distinctive patterns
of energy time series. Furthermore, we formulate a novel objective function
that accounts for performance generalization in temporal context and the
maximal exploration of different regions of our high-dimensional search space.
The results obtained on energy production time series show that an ensemble of
lightweight architectures discovered with NAS outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques, such as Transformers, as well as pre-trained forecasting models, in
terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

*Seonggyun Lee,Sungjun Lim,Seojin Park,Soeun Cheon,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) to align language models with human preferences using minimal labeled data and leveraging unpaired samples, achieving high efficiency and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference optimization methods require extensive labeled datasets, which are resource-intensive. This paper aims to reduce reliance on labeled data while maintaining high human alignment performance.

Method: SSPO combines a small amount of pairwise labeled preference data with unpaired data using theoretical insights, such as identifying an optimal reward threshold. Pseudo-labels derived from this threshold are employed to distill latent preferences.

Result: SSPO, using only 1% labeled data on UltraFeedback, surpasses methods trained on 10% of UltraFeedback when tested with Llama3-8B-Instruct, demonstrating significant improvements in data efficiency and model performance.

Conclusion: SSPO enables effective learning from limited labeled data and large-scale unpaired data by using pseudo-labeling techniques, proving to be resource-efficient and capable of better aligning language models with human preferences.

Abstract: The field of preference optimization has made outstanding contributions to
the alignment of language models with human preferences. Despite these
advancements, recent methods still rely heavily on substantial paired (labeled)
feedback data, leading to substantial resource expenditures. To address these
challenges, we study the problem of Semi-Supervised Preference Optimization
(SSPO) in which the idea is to learn from both a small number of pairwise
preference labels and a large pool of unpaired samples simultaneously. Our key
theoretical contribution proves the existence of an optimal reward threshold
capable of separating winning and losing responses with high probability, which
enables a principled pseudo-labeling of unpaired data. By leveraging these
pseudo-labels, SSPO effectively distills latent preferences from large-scale
unpaired data, thus maintaining human alignment while drastically reducing
acquisition costs. Extensive experiments across datasets validate this
remarkable data efficiency; for instance, SSPO trained with Llama3-8B-Instruct
on just 1% of UltraFeedback consistently surpasses strong baselines trained on
10% of UltraFeedback.

*Tyrus Whitman,Andrew Particka,Christopher Diers,Ian Griffin,Charuka Wickramasinghe,Pradeep Ranaweera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are explored for solving challenging ordinary differential equation (ODE) problems, demonstrating the necessity of proper loss function balancing and hyperparameter tuning for accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional numerical methods in solving complex ODE problems such as high stiffness, shocks, irregular domains, and singular perturbations, PINNs are investigated as an alternative.

Method: PINNs are validated using classical ODE problems as controlled testbeds, analyzing convergence, accuracy, and generalization capabilities, with focus on loss function balancing and hyperparameter tuning.

Result: PINNs exhibit improved predictive capabilities for complex ODEs when components like data loss, initial condition loss, and residual loss are balanced effectively and hyperparameters are systematically tuned.

Conclusion: PINNs provide an effective framework for solving complex ODE problems by incorporating physical laws into the learning process and embedding prior knowledge, although they require meticulous configuration.

Abstract: In this study, we present and validate the predictive capability of the
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) methodology for solving a variety of
engineering and biological dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). While traditional numerical methods a re effective for many
ODEs, they often struggle to achieve convergence in problems involving high
stiffness, shocks, irregular domains, singular perturbations, high dimensions,
or boundary discontinuities. Alternatively, PINNs offer a powerful approach for
handling challenging numerical scenarios. In this study, classical ODE problems
are employed as controlled testbeds to systematically evaluate the accuracy,
training efficiency, and generalization capability under controlled conditions
of the PINNs framework. Although not a universal solution, PINNs can achieve
superior results by embedding physical laws directly into the learning process.
We first analyze the existence and uniqueness properties of several benchmark
problems and subsequently validate the PINNs methodology on these model
systems. Our results demonstrate that for complex problems to converge to
correct solutions, the loss function components data loss, initial condition
loss, and residual loss must be appropriately balanced through careful
weighting. We further establish that systematic tuning of hyperparameters,
including network depth, layer width, activation functions, learning rate,
optimization algorithms, w eight initialization schemes, and collocation point
sampling, plays a crucial role in achieving accurate solutions. Additionally,
embedding prior knowledge and imposing hard constraints on the network
architecture, without loss the generality of the ODE system, significantly
enhances the predictive capability of PINNs.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving accurate and interpretable classification in motor imagery EEG for brain-computer interfaces.

Method: Comparison of ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO using fuzzy reasoning and feature extraction versus EEGNet deep learning using hierarchical spatial temporal representations. Analysis conducted on BCI Competition IV-2a dataset.

Result: ANFIS achieved higher accuracy in within-subject experiments, while EEGNet demonstrated better cross-subject generalization in tests.

Conclusion: Guidance is provided for selecting MI-BCI systems based on design goals, and future research directions suggest improvements with transformer-based or hybrid neuro-symbolic frameworks.

Abstract: Achieving both accurate and interpretable classification of motor imagery EEG
remains a key challenge in brain computer interface (BCI) research. This paper
compares a transparent fuzzy reasoning approach (ANFIS-FBCSP-PSO) with a deep
learning benchmark (EEGNet) using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. The ANFIS
pipeline combines filter bank common spatial pattern feature extraction with
fuzzy IF-THEN rules optimized via particle swarm optimization, while EEGNet
learns hierarchical spatial temporal representations directly from raw EEG
data. In within-subject experiments, the fuzzy neural model performed better
(68.58 percent +/- 13.76 percent accuracy, kappa = 58.04 percent +/- 18.43),
while in cross-subject (LOSO) tests, the deep model exhibited stronger
generalization (68.20 percent +/- 12.13 percent accuracy, kappa = 57.33 percent
+/- 16.22). The study provides practical guidance for selecting MI-BCI systems
according to design goals: interpretability or robustness across users. Future
investigations into transformer based and hybrid neuro symbolic frameworks are
expected to advance transparent EEG decoding.

*Kohei Tsuchiyama,Andre Roehm,Takatomo Mihana,Ryoichi Horisaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the ReLaX-Net architecture to improve computational efficiency in physical neural networks (PNNs) through hardware-friendly weight-tying and layer reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physical neural networks (PNNs) have a limitation in scale and performance compared to digital neural networks due to constraints on trainable parameters.

Method: The ReLaX-Net architecture introduces a layer-by-layer time-multiplexing approach, requiring only fast switches, to expand network depth and reuse parameters efficiently in PNNs.

Result: Numerical experiments on image classification and natural language processing tasks demonstrate ReLaX-Net's superior computational performance compared to traditional deep neural networks with the same number of parameters.

Conclusion: ReLaX-Net offers a promising solution for scaling physical neural networks efficiently and improving their performance with minimal hardware modifications.

Abstract: Physical Neural Networks (PNN) are promising platforms for next-generation
computing systems. However, recent advances in digital neural network
performance are largely driven by the rapid growth in the number of trainable
parameters and, so far, demonstrated PNNs are lagging behind by several orders
of magnitude in terms of scale. This mirrors size and performance constraints
found in early digital neural networks. In that period, efficient reuse of
parameters contributed to the development of parameter-efficient architectures
such as convolutional neural networks.
  In this work, we numerically investigate hardware-friendly weight-tying for
PNNs. Crucially, with many PNN systems, there is a time-scale separation
between the fast dynamic active elements of the forward pass and the only
slowly trainable elements implementing weights and biases. With this in mind,we
propose the Reuse of Layers for eXpanding a Neural Network (ReLaX-Net)
architecture, which employs a simple layer-by-layer time-multiplexing scheme to
increase the effective network depth and efficiently use the number of
parameters. We only require the addition of fast switches for existing PNNs. We
validate ReLaX-Nets via numerical experiments on image classification and
natural language processing tasks. Our results show that ReLaX-Net improves
computational performance with only minor modifications to a conventional PNN.
We observe a favorable scaling, where ReLaX-Nets exceed the performance of
equivalent traditional RNNs or DNNs with the same number of parameters.

TL;DR: DynBERG integrates Graph-BERT with GRU to analyze dynamic, directed financial transaction networks, outperforming benchmarks in fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance financial fraud detection in dynamic and directed financial transaction networks, addressing limitations of static models like Graph-BERT.

Method: DynBERG combines Graph-BERT with a GRU layer for temporal dynamics, accommodating directed edges. It was tested on the Elliptic Bitcoin transaction dataset.

Result: DynBERG outperformed EvolveGCN before the Dark Market Shutdown and GCN afterward in fraud detection performance. The GRU layer proved critical in modelling temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: DynBERG shows improved adaptability to dynamic financial networks and significant market shifts, demonstrating superior efficiency in fraud detection compared to leading models.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is critical for maintaining the integrity of
financial systems, particularly in decentralised environments such as
cryptocurrency networks. Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are
widely used for financial fraud detection, graph Transformer models such as
Graph-BERT are gaining prominence due to their Transformer-based architecture,
which mitigates issues such as over-smoothing. Graph-BERT is designed for
static graphs and primarily evaluated on citation networks with undirected
edges. However, financial transaction networks are inherently dynamic, with
evolving structures and directed edges representing the flow of money. To
address these challenges, we introduce DynBERG, a novel architecture that
integrates Graph-BERT with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer to capture
temporal evolution over multiple time steps. Additionally, we modify the
underlying algorithm to support directed edges, making DynBERG well-suited for
dynamic financial transaction analysis. We evaluate our model on the Elliptic
dataset, which includes Bitcoin transactions, including all transactions during
a major cryptocurrency market event, the Dark Market Shutdown. By assessing
DynBERG's resilience before and after this event, we analyse its ability to
adapt to significant market shifts that impact transaction behaviours. Our
model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art dynamic graph classification
approaches, such as EvolveGCN and GCN, demonstrating superior performance,
outperforming EvolveGCN before the market shutdown and surpassing GCN after the
event. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the critical role of
incorporating a time-series deep learning component, showcasing the
effectiveness of GRU in modelling the temporal dynamics of financial
transactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems are crucial for thermal responses, stability, and analyzing natural modes, yet existing PINN methods are inefficient.

Method: The authors reformulate PINNs into a biconvex optimization problem with analytically optimal updates, using Alternating Convex Search (ACS).

Result: This reformulation results in convergence speeds up to 500 times faster compared to traditional PINN training methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PINN-ACS approach significantly improves PINN efficiency for eigenvalue problems, offering accelerated and reliable solutions.

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems have a distinctive forward-inverse structure and are
fundamental to characterizing a system's thermal response, stability, and
natural modes. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a mesh-free
alternative for solving such problems but are often orders of magnitude slower
than classical numerical schemes. In this paper, we introduce a reformulated
PINN approach that casts the search for eigenpairs as a biconvex optimization
problem, enabling fast and provably convergent alternating convex search (ACS)
over eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using analytically optimal updates.
Numerical experiments show that PINN-ACS attains high accuracy with convergence
speeds up to 500$\times$ faster than gradient-based PINN training. We release

Motivation: Accurate weather forecasting is challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of atmospheric systems.

Result: Experiments on ERA5 and MERRA-2 datasets reveal that this model surpasses traditional weather prediction methods and recent deep learning techniques.

Conclusion: This scalable, label-efficient solution is promising for improving data-driven weather forecasting systems.

Abstract: Accurate and robust weather forecasting remains a fundamental challenge due
to the inherent spatio-temporal complexity of atmospheric systems. In this
paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework that leverages
spatio-temporal structures to improve multi-variable weather prediction. The
model integrates a graph neural network (GNN) for spatial reasoning, a
self-supervised pretraining scheme for representation learning, and a
spatio-temporal adaptation mechanism to enhance generalization across varying
forecasting horizons. Extensive experiments on both ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and recent deep

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLoRA, which improves LLM fine-tuning efficiency by fusing forward and backward adapters, gaining better accuracy and latency than LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of LLMs has increased the demand for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Despite advances like LoRA, much remains unexplored, presenting an opportunity for innovation.

Method: The authors propose FLoRA, a method incorporating fused forward-backward adapters (FFBA). Combining ideas from LoRA and parallel adapters, FFBA is integrated into the base model’s projection layers to enhance fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results show FLoRA outperforms LoRA in both accuracy and latency while using comparable parameter resources.

Conclusion: FLoRA demonstrates improved parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large language models, addressing both performance and latency challenges systematically.

Abstract: As the large language models (LLMs) grow in size each day, efficient training
and fine-tuning has never been as important as nowadays. This resulted in the
great interest in parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and effective methods
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) has emerged. Although the various PEFT
methods have been studied extensively in the recent years, the greater part of
the subject remains unexplored with the huge degree of freedom. In this paper,
we propose FLoRA, a family of fused forward-backward adapters (FFBA) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs on downstream tasks. The FFBA combine
ideas from the popular LoRA and parallel adapters to improve the overall
fine-tuning accuracies. At the same time, latencies are minimized by fusing the
forward and backward adapters into existing projection layers of the base
model. Experimental results show that the proposed FFB adapters perform
significantly better than the popularly used LoRA in both accuracy and latency
for a similar parameter budget.

Motivation: Improve AI system adaptability on edge devices in open-world environments, where data distributions shift and new classes emerge, without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Presented a neuromorphic solution called CLP-SNN using spiking neural networks with event-driven sparse learning, a self-normalizing learning rule, and integrated neurogenesis and metaplasticity.

Result: CLP-SNN achieves competitive accuracy in OpenLORIS tests, is 70x faster, and 5,600x more energy efficient than GPU-based OCL alternatives.

Conclusion: Brain-inspired algorithms with neuromorphic hardware can significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy, redefining future edge AI capabilities.

Abstract: AI systems on edge devices face a critical challenge in open-world
environments: adapting when data distributions shift and novel classes emerge.
While offline training dominates current paradigms, online continual learning
(OCL)--where models learn incrementally from non-stationary streams without
catastrophic forgetting--remains challenging in power-constrained settings. We
present a neuromorphic solution called CLP-SNN: a spiking neural network
architecture for Continually Learning Prototypes and its implementation on
Intel's Loihi 2 chip. Our approach introduces three innovations: (1)
event-driven and spatiotemporally sparse local learning, (2) a self-normalizing
three-factor learning rule maintaining weight normalization, and (3) integrated
neurogenesis and metaplasticity for capacity expansion and forgetting
mitigation. On OpenLORIS few-shot learning experiments, CLP-SNN achieves
accuracy competitive with replay methods while being rehearsal-free. CLP-SNN
delivers transformative efficiency gains: 70\times faster (0.33ms vs 23.2ms),
and 5,600\times more energy efficient (0.05mJ vs 281mJ) than the best
alternative OCL on edge GPU. This demonstrates that co-designed brain-inspired

trade-offs for future edge AI systems.

TL;DR: The study enhances Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods by addressing the limitations of DoRA and introducing two new approaches, Pre-Diag and SORA, for improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational challenges and unclear mechanisms in existing PEFT methods, particularly enhancing upon the DoRA method.

Method: The authors identify the mechanism of DoRA's success, reformulate it into an efficient matrix form, and propose Pre-Diag and SORA as advanced PEFT techniques under a unified framework.

Result: The introduced methods, Pre-Diag and SORA, showed superior efficiency and performance in natural language tasks compared to LoRA and DoRA.

Conclusion: Pre-Diag and SORA provide effective transformations for PEFT, offering a significant step forward in adapting large pre-trained models efficiently, with improved performance.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are crucial for adapting large
pre-trained models. Among these, LoRA is considered a foundational approach.
Building on this, the influential DoRA method enhances performance by
decomposing weight updates into magnitude and direction. However, its
underlying mechanism remains unclear, and it introduces significant
computational overhead. In this work, we first identify that DoRA's success
stems from its capacity to increase the singular value entropy of the weight
update matrix, which promotes a more uniform update distribution akin to full
fine-tuning. We then reformulate DoRA into a mathematically equivalent and more
efficient matrix form, revealing it as a learnable weight conditioning method.
Based on this insight, we propose a unified framework for designing advanced
PEFT methods by exploring two orthogonal dimensions: the architectural
placement and the transformation type of the conditioning matrix. Within this
framework, we introduce two novel methods: (1) \textbf{Pre-Diag}, which applies
a diagonal conditioning matrix before the LoRA update to efficiently calibrate
the pre-trained weights, thereby enhancing performance while reducing training
time; and (2) \textbf{S}kewed \textbf{O}rthogonal \textbf{R}otation
\textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{SORA}), which employs a parameter-efficient
orthogonal rotation to perform a more powerful, norm-preserving transformation
of the feature space. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding
and generation tasks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior
performance and efficiency compared to both LoRA and DoRA. The code is

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Feature-Guided Analysis (FGA) in explaining neural network decisions using benchmarks like MNIST and LSC, showing high precision but varying recall based on network and feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of neural network decision-making, particularly for adoption in safety-critical and industrial contexts.

Method: The applicability and effectiveness of FGA were tested on benchmark datasets (MNIST, LSC). The influence of neural network architecture, training, and feature selection on FGA's precision and recall was also analyzed.

Result: FGA demonstrated high precision in explaining neural network behavior on the benchmark datasets. Neural architecture and feature selection mainly influenced recall, with limited effect on precision.

Conclusion: While FGA shows promising results and high precision in explaining neural networks' functions on tested datasets, its recall varies notably depending on architecture and feature selection.

Abstract: Understanding why neural networks make certain decisions is pivotal for their
use in safety-critical applications. Feature-Guided Analysis (FGA) extracts
slices of neural networks relevant to their tasks. Existing feature-guided
approaches typically monitor the activation of the neural network neurons to
extract the relevant rules. Preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate
the feasibility of this solution by assessing the precision and recall of
Feature-Guided Analysis on two pilot case studies. However, the applicability
in industrial contexts needs additional empirical evidence.
  To mitigate this need, this paper assesses the applicability of FGA on a
benchmark made by the MNIST and LSC datasets. We assessed the effectiveness of
FGA in computing rules that explain the behavior of the neural network. Our
results show that FGA has a higher precision on our benchmark than the results
from the literature. We also evaluated how the selection of the neural network
architecture, training, and feature selection affect the effectiveness of FGA.
Our results show that the selection significantly affects the recall of FGA,
while it has a negligible impact on its precision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quadratic-form weighted training objective to improve time-series forecasting models by accounting for label autocorrelation and task weighting disparities, significantly enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing objectives like mean squared error fail to consider label autocorrelation among future steps and do not assign appropriate weights to varying forecasting tasks.

Method: The authors developed the Quadratic Direct Forecast (QDF) learning algorithm that uses an adaptively updated quadratic-form weighting matrix to address training biases and achieve optimal task weighting.

Result: QDF was tested across various forecast models, demonstrating significant improvements and surpassing state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Conclusion: The novel quadratic-form training objective and QDF algorithm effectively improve time-series forecasting by handling label autocorrelation and heterogeneous task weighting, contributing to better model accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The design of training objective is central to training time-series
forecasting models. Existing training objectives such as mean squared error
mostly treat each future step as an independent, equally weighted task, which
we found leading to the following two issues: (1) overlook the label
autocorrelation effect among future steps, leading to biased training
objective; (2) fail to set heterogeneous task weights for different forecasting
tasks corresponding to varying future steps, limiting the forecasting
performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel quadratic-form weighted
training objective, addressing both of the issues simultaneously. Specifically,
the off-diagonal elements of the weighting matrix account for the label
autocorrelation effect, whereas the non-uniform diagonals are expected to match
the most preferable weights of the forecasting tasks with varying future steps.
To achieve this, we propose a Quadratic Direct Forecast (QDF) learning
algorithm, which trains the forecast model using the adaptively updated
quadratic-form weighting matrix. Experiments show that our QDF effectively
improves performance of various forecast models, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/QDF-8937.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialTraceGen, a framework to improve complex spatial reasoning for vision-language models (VLMs) by generating high-quality, step-by-step reasoning datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning and problem decomposition due to the lack of high-quality reasoning datasets for fine-tuning.

Method: The authors develop SpatialTraceGen, which distills the reasoning processes of a large model into a dataset of reasoning traces, using an automated Verifier to ensure fidelity and scalability.

Result: On the CLEVR-Humans benchmark, SpatialTraceGen boosts trace quality scores by 17% while reducing quality variance by over 40%.

Conclusion: SpatialTraceGen enables efficient fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning by providing high-quality reasoning datasets, enhancing VLMs' spatial reasoning abilities.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many areas, they struggle with
complex spatial reasoning, which requires problem decomposition and strategic
tool use. Fine-tuning smaller, more deployable models offers an efficient path
to strong performance, but this is hampered by a major bottleneck: the absence
of high-quality, step-by-step reasoning data. To address this data-efficiency
gap, we introduce SpatialTraceGen, a framework to distill the reasoning
processes of a large teacher model into a high-quality dataset of multi-hop,
multi-tool reasoning traces. A key innovation is our automated Verifier, which
scalably ensures the fidelity of each reasoning step, providing a
cost-effective alternative to manual human annotation. On the CLEVR-Humans
benchmark, this verifier-guided process improves the average quality score of
traces by 17\% while reducing quality variance by over 40\%. SpatialTraceGen
delivers a dataset of expert traces, providing the structured, step-by-step
examples of tool use necessary for effective fine-tuning and sample-efficient
offline reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Federated Learning (FL) for UAV-based thermal image analysis, focusing on performance metrics and workflows in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Centralized Learning in cases where data cannot be shared centrally due to privacy or technical issues, particularly in UAV-based urban imaging.

Method: Evaluation of various FL algorithms using real-world thermal image data captured in two German cities, comparing them to centralized learning based on metrics such as accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy use.

Result: Federated Learning algorithms were assessed against centralized learning baselines, offering insights into performance, workflows (client vs. server-controlled), and limitations in segmentation tasks for UAV thermal images.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical examination of FL's capabilities and challenges, contributing to its understanding and highlighting its suitability for distributed UAV-based image segmentation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an approach for training a shared Machine Learning
(ML) model with distributed training data and multiple participants. FL allows
bypassing limitations of the traditional Centralized Machine Learning CL if
data cannot be shared or stored centrally due to privacy or technical
restrictions -- the participants train the model locally with their training
data and do not need to share it among the other participants. This paper
investigates the practical implementation and effectiveness of FL in a
real-world scenario, specifically focusing on unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based thermal images for common thermal feature detection in urban
environments. The distributed nature of the data arises naturally and makes it
suitable for FL applications, as images captured in two German cities are
available. This application presents unique challenges due to non-identical
distribution and feature characteristics of data captured at both locations.
The study makes several key contributions by evaluating FL algorithms in real
deployment scenarios rather than simulation. We compare several FL approaches
with a centralized learning baseline across key performance metrics such as
model accuracy, training time, communication overhead, and energy usage. This
paper also explores various FL workflows, comparing client-controlled workflows
and server-controlled workflows. The findings of this work serve as a valuable
reference for understanding the practical application and limitations of the FL
methods in segmentation tasks in UAV-based imaging.

### [233] [MISA: Memory-Efficient LLMs Optimization with Module-wise Importance Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00056)
*Yuxi Liu,Renjia Deng,Yutong He,Xue Wang,Tao Yao,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MISA is a method to improve memory efficiency and performance in optimizing large language models by dividing layers into smaller modules and applying importance sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer-wise optimization methods for large language models are memory-efficient but suboptimal in performance as they overlook the varying importance of modules within each layer.

Method: MISA divides transformer layers into smaller modules, assigns importance scores, and uses weighted random sampling to activate modules, reducing gradient variance and optimizing memory usage.

Result: MISA achieves a convergence rate of \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\), demonstrates reduced memory usage compared to traditional methods, and shows effectiveness across various learning tasks according to experimental results.

Conclusion: MISA addresses the limitations of traditional layer-wise optimization techniques in large language models by providing a more granular and memory-efficient optimization process, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Abstract: The substantial memory demands of pre-training and fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) require memory-efficient optimization algorithms. One promising
approach is layer-wise optimization, which treats each transformer block as a
single layer and optimizes it sequentially, while freezing the other layers to
save optimizer states and activations. Although effective, these methods ignore
the varying importance of the modules within each layer, leading to suboptimal
performance. Moreover, layer-wise sampling provides only limited memory
savings, as at least one full layer must remain active during optimization. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Module-wise Importance SAmpling (MISA),
a novel method that divides each layer into smaller modules and assigns
importance scores to each module. MISA uses a weighted random sampling
mechanism to activate modules, provably reducing gradient variance compared to
layer-wise sampling. Additionally, we establish an \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\)
convergence rate under non-convex and stochastic conditions, where $K$ is the
total number of block updates, and provide a detailed memory analysis
showcasing MISA's superiority over existing baseline methods. Experiments on
diverse learning tasks validate the effectiveness of MISA. Source code is

*David Lüdke,Tom Wollschläger,Paul Ungermann,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient framework using non-autoregressive generative LLMs, like Diffusion LLMs, for prompt optimization tasks, eliminating resource-intensive adversarial search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the resource-heavy problem of adversarial prompt optimization, replacing discrete optimization with an efficient inference task using generative LLMs.

Method: The method involves using Diffusion LLMs to model joint distributions of prompt-response pairs for efficient direct conditional prompt generation and probabilistic analysis to recover high-reward prompts with few conditional samples.

Result: The framework produces low-perplexity, diverse adversarial prompts with strong transferability to robust and proprietary models, facilitating wide applications in black-box environments.

Conclusion: This approach improves adversarial prompting efficiency and opens up new opportunities in red teaming, automated optimization, and leveraging advanced generative LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that transforms the resource-intensive
(adversarial) prompt optimization problem into an \emph{efficient, amortized
inference task}. Our core insight is that pretrained, non-autoregressive
generative LLMs, such as Diffusion LLMs, which model the joint distribution
over prompt-response pairs, can serve as powerful surrogates for prompt search.
This approach enables the direct conditional generation of prompts, effectively
replacing costly, per-instance discrete optimization with a small number of
parallelizable samples. We provide a probabilistic analysis demonstrating that
under mild fidelity assumptions, only a few conditional samples are required to
recover high-reward (harmful) prompts. Empirically, we find that the generated
prompts are low-perplexity, diverse jailbreaks that exhibit strong
transferability to a wide range of black-box target models, including robustly
trained and proprietary LLMs. Beyond adversarial prompting, our framework opens
new directions for red teaming, automated prompt optimization, and leveraging
emerging Flow- and Diffusion-based LLMs.

*Aditya Singh,Zihang Wen,Srujananjali Medicherla,Adam Karvonen,Can Rager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OthelloGPT, a transformer for predicting valid moves in Othello, is used as a testbed for interpretability research. The paper introduces a method using decision trees to analyze neuron activations and reveals human-readable logical forms of these patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore interpretability in complex models by focusing on rule-based game logic, providing insights into how models encode computational structures specifically suited to grounded tasks like Othello.

Method: The authors use decision trees to map board states to MLP neuron activations, extracting logical forms from highly active neuron pathways. They also verify the causal relevance of identified patterns through targeted neuron interventions.

Result: Approximately half of the neurons in layer 5 are described by rule-based decision trees with high accuracy. Ablation experiments show significant impact of these neurons on the model's prediction capabilities for specific game patterns.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a substantial portion of MLP neurons in OthelloGPT encodes interpretable, rule-based game logic, offering tools for future interpretability research into structured computational processes.

Abstract: OthelloGPT, a transformer trained to predict valid moves in Othello, provides
an ideal testbed for interpretability research. The model is complex enough to
exhibit rich computational patterns, yet grounded in rule-based game logic that
enables meaningful reverse-engineering. We present an automated approach based
on decision trees to identify and interpret MLP neurons that encode rule-based
game logic. Our method trains regression decision trees to map board states to
neuron activations, then extracts decision paths where neurons are highly
active to convert them into human-readable logical forms. These descriptions
reveal highly interpretable patterns; for instance, neurons that specifically
detect when diagonal moves become legal. Our findings suggest that roughly half
of the neurons in layer 5 can be accurately described by compact, rule-based
decision trees ($R^2 > 0.7$ for 913 of 2,048 neurons), while the remainder
likely participate in more distributed or non-rule-based computations. We
verify the causal relevance of patterns identified by our decision trees
through targeted interventions. For a specific square, for specific game
patterns, we ablate neurons corresponding to those patterns and find an
approximately 5-10 fold stronger degradation in the model's ability to predict
legal moves along those patterns compared to control patterns. To facilitate
future work, we provide a Python tool that maps rule-based game behaviors to
their implementing neurons, serving as a resource for researchers to test
whether their interpretability methods recover meaningful computational
structures.

TL;DR: This paper precisely determines the minimax optimal expected regret for the non-stochastic multi-armed bandit with expert advice problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find the exact minimax optimal expected regret in the non-stochastic multi-armed bandit setup and establish bounds.

Method: Lower bound derivation that matches the established upper bound from Kale (2014), ensuring tight regret estimation.

Result: Minimax optimal expected regret is $\Theta\left(\sqrt{T K \log (N/K)}\right)$ with parameters arms (K), experts (N), and time horizon (T).

Conclusion: The established bounds confirm the precise minimax regret and validate theoretical understanding in this domain.

Abstract: We determine the minimax optimal expected regret in the classic
non-stochastic multi-armed bandit with expert advice problem, by proving a
lower bound that matches the upper bound of Kale (2014). The two bounds
determine the minimax optimal expected regret to be $\Theta\left( \sqrt{T K

experts, and $T$ is the time horizon.

*Randolph Wiredu-Aidoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel clustering algorithm called EVINGCA introduces adaptability and local statistical feedback to improve clustering reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering algorithms rely on restrictive assumptions, such as requiring clusters to be convex or Gaussian-like, which limits their adaptability across diverse data types.

Method: EVINGCA employs a density-variance approach combined with adaptive, evolving nearest-neighbor graph expansion, using local and dynamic statistics to guide cluster formation.

Result: The algorithm exhibits log-linear average complexity and competitive clustering performance across synthetic, real-world, and high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: EVINGCA offers an improved approach by optimizing computational efficiency and adapting cluster formation to data characteristics, making it suitable for various data sets.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms often rely on restrictive assumptions: K-Means and
Gaussian Mixtures presuppose convex, Gaussian-like clusters, while DBSCAN and
HDBSCAN capture non-convexity but can be highly sensitive. I introduce EVINGCA
(Evolving Variance-Informed Nonparametric Graph Construction Algorithm), a
density-variance based clustering algorithm that treats cluster formation as an
adaptive, evolving process on a nearest-neighbor graph. EVINGCA expands rooted
graphs via breadth-first search, guided by continuously updated local distance
and shape statistics, replacing fixed density thresholds with local statistical
feedback. With spatial indexing, EVINGCA features log-linear complexity in the
average case and exhibits competitive performance against baselines across a
variety of synthetic, real-world, low-d, and high-d datasets.

### [238] [A Technical Exploration of Causal Inference with Hybrid LLM Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00318)
*Dana Kim,Yichen Xu,Tiffany Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights that current techniques using GANs and LLMs for synthetic tabular data fail in preserving causal effects like Average Treatment Effect (ATE). They propose a hybrid framework combined with synthetic pairings to maintain causal structures and improve causal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of existing synthetic tabular data generation methods to preserve critical causal parameters such as ATE, while ensuring high predictive fidelity.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid model-based synthesis method combining covariate synthesis, propensity learning, outcome modeling, and a synthetic pairing strategy to address positivity violations in causal structures.

Result: Their method ensures generated data better preserves causal structures (such as triplet relationships W, A, Y) while maintaining high predictive capability, making it suitable for causal inference.

Conclusion: This research establishes a robust framework and evaluation protocol for utilizing LLMs in synthetic data generation that effectively supports causal analysis methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a flexible means to generate synthetic
tabular data, yet existing approaches often fail to preserve key causal
parameters such as the average treatment effect (ATE). In this technical
exploration, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art synthetic data
generators, both GAN- and LLM-based, can achieve high predictive fidelity while
substantially misestimating causal effects. To address this gap, we propose a
hybrid generation framework that combines model-based covariate synthesis
(monitored via distance-to-closest-record filtering) with separately learned
propensity and outcome models, thereby ensuring that (W, A, Y) triplets retain
their underlying causal structure. We further introduce a synthetic pairing
strategy to mitigate positivity violations and a realistic evaluation protocol
that leverages unlimited synthetic samples to benchmark traditional estimators
(IPTW, AIPW, substitution) under complex covariate distributions. This work
lays the groundwork for LLM-powered data pipelines that support robust causal
analysis. Our code is available at

*Kateryna Shapovalenko,Quentin Auster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how different layers of pre-trained models (wav2vec2 and CLIP) align with the brain's layered processing of language, using EEG data during natural speech perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how language processing in the brain incorporates multimodal associations, beyond raw acoustics, enhancing connections between computational models and neuroscience.

Method: Comparing embeddings from wav2vec2 and CLIP models using EEG-based ridge regression and contrastive decoding, focusing on individual layers, progressive concatenation, and progressive summation.

Result: The study finds that multimodal, layer-aware representations better align with brain activity, offering insights into linguistic understanding as experience.

Conclusion: Combining layered and multimodal embeddings improves our ability to decode and relate brain activities with language comprehension processes.

Abstract: When we hear the word "house", we don't just process sound, we imagine walls,
doors, memories. The brain builds meaning through layers, moving from raw
acoustics to rich, multimodal associations. Inspired by this, we build on
recent work from Meta that aligned EEG signals with averaged wav2vec2 speech
embeddings, and ask a deeper question: which layers of pre-trained models best
reflect this layered processing in the brain? We compare embeddings from two
models: wav2vec2, which encodes sound into language, and CLIP, which maps words
to images. Using EEG recorded during natural speech perception, we evaluate how
these embeddings align with brain activity using ridge regression and
contrastive decoding. We test three strategies: individual layers, progressive
concatenation, and progressive summation. The findings suggest that combining
multimodal, layer-aware representations may bring us closer to decoding how the
brain understands language, not just as sound, but as experience.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sparsity-based framework to assess algorithmic fairness across diverse domains, validated through comprehensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Algorithmic fairness challenges persist due to the lack of generalizability in existing fairness measures for diverse machine learning problems.

Method: Connections among sparsity measures are analyzed, leading to the proposal of a unified framework to evaluate fairness, tested across datasets and mitigation methods.

Result: The framework effectively aligns with existing fairness criteria and demonstrates applicability across varied machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: The sparsity-based approach offers a novel way to evaluate fairness, emphasizing social equity and broadening the research scope in fairness applications.

Abstract: Ensuring algorithmic fairness remains a significant challenge in machine
learning, particularly as models are increasingly applied across diverse
domains. While numerous fairness criteria exist, they often lack
generalizability across different machine learning problems. This paper
examines the connections and differences among various sparsity measures in
promoting fairness and proposes a unified sparsity-based framework for
evaluating algorithmic fairness. The framework aligns with existing fairness
criteria and demonstrates broad applicability to a wide range of machine
learning tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework as
an evaluation metric through extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and
bias mitigation methods. This work provides a novel perspective to algorithmic
fairness by framing it through the lens of sparsity and social equity, offering
potential for broader impact on fairness research and applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TR-GRPO, an improvement on GRPO, to address issues of token imbalance in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve a critical issue in GRPO where low-probability tokens disproportionately influence gradient updates, leading to unstable training and reduced effectiveness of high-probability tokens.

Method: The proposed method, TR-GRPO, assigns token-level weights based on the model’s predicted probability to downweigh low-probability tokens and emphasize high-probability ones.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TR-GRPO outperforms GRPO in reinforcement learning tasks like logic, math, and reasoning.

Conclusion: TR-GRPO is shown to be a robust and effective framework for enhancing reasoning in LLMs by regulating token contributions during training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful approach for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Among existing algorithms, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated strong performance, yet it suffers from a
critical issue: low-probability tokens disproportionately dominate gradient
updates due to their inherently large gradient magnitudes. This imbalance leads
to unstable training and suppresses the contribution of high-probability tokens
that are more reliable for learning. In this work, we introduce Token-Regulated
Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO), a simple yet effective extension
of GRPO that assigns token-level weights positively correlated with the model's
predicted probability. By downweighting low-probability tokens and emphasizing
high-probability ones, TR-GRPO mitigates gradient over-amplification while
preserving informative learning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TR-GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across RLVR tasks, including logic, math,
and agentic reasoning, highlighting the importance of regulating token
contributions during RL training and establishing TR-GRPO as a robust framework
for enhancing LLM reasoning.

*Zhixing Li,Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee,Yinan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve domain generalization in vision-language models (VLMs) without relying on explicit domain labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization is essential for vision-language models as they need to adapt effectively to real-world scenarios with domain shifts, often without explicit domain labels.

Method: The authors perform latent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text features based on the similarity between an input image and latent domains discovered in training data.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over VLM-based baselines, highlighting enhanced robustness against domain shifts.

Conclusion: Latent domain representation and adaptive knowledge transfer are effective strategies for improving domain generalization in VLMs without requiring explicit domain labels.

Abstract: The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enable models to be robust
against domain shift. DG is crucial for deploying vision-language models (VLMs)
in real-world applications, yet most existing methods rely on domain labels
that may not be available and often ambiguous. We instead study the DG setting
where models must generalize well without access to explicit domain labels. Our
key idea is to represent an unseen target domain as a combination of latent
domains automatically discovered from training data, enabling the model to
adaptively transfer knowledge across domains. To realize this, we perform
latent domain clustering on image features and fuse domain-specific text
features based on the similarity between the input image and each latent
domain. Experiments on four benchmarks show that this strategy yields
consistent gains over VLM-based baselines and provides new insights into
improving robustness under domain shift.

*Zhongxiang Lei,Qi Yang,Ping Qiu,Gang Zhang,Yuanchi Ma,Jinyan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses the performance degradation in federated optimization under data heterogeneity and introduces a theoretical explanation for the problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear reasons behind performance degradation in federated optimization due to data heterogeneity.

Method: The paper assumes heterogeneous client data causing distinct local optima and analyzes its implications through theoretical explanations and experiments.

Result: Key findings include: (1) heterogeneity raises the lower bound of the global objective; (2) the global model oscillates in a region without converging fully. Experimental validation supports these findings.

Conclusion: The paper explains why federated optimization struggles in non-iid settings and provides theoretical and experimental insights, aiding advancements in distributed learning approaches.

Abstract: Federated optimization is a constrained form of distributed optimization that
enables training a global model without directly sharing client data. Although
existing algorithms can guarantee convergence in theory and often achieve
stable training in practice, the reasons behind performance degradation under
data heterogeneity remain unclear. To address this gap, the main contribution
of this paper is to provide a theoretical perspective that explains why such
degradation occurs. We introduce the assumption that heterogeneous client data
lead to distinct local optima, and show that this assumption implies two key
consequences: 1) the distance among clients' local optima raises the lower
bound of the global objective, making perfect fitting of all client data
impossible; and 2) in the final training stage, the global model oscillates
within a region instead of converging to a single optimum, limiting its ability
to fully fit the data. These results provide a principled explanation for
performance degradation in non-iid settings, which we further validate through
experiments across multiple tasks and neural network architectures. The

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Bayesian Optimization (BO) frameworks in solving constrained multi-objective regression tasks, particularly in the context of inverse design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs, despite not being architected for constrained numerical tasks, can function as competitive generative optimizers in complex, high-dimensional spaces related to materials informatics.

Method: Conducting a comparison between fine-tuned LLMs and BO frameworks, utilizing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for LLMs and advanced qEHVI algorithms for BO.

Result: Specialized BO frameworks outperformed (GD=0.0), but fine-tuned LLMs (WizardMath-7B) demonstrated significant improvement over baseline BO methods (GD=1.21 vs GD=15.03).

Conclusion: While BO frameworks ensure perfect convergence, fine-tuned LLMs provide a computationally fast and effective alternative, broadening the scope of AI-driven optimization applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
generative optimizers for solving constrained multi-objective regression tasks,
specifically within the challenging domain of inverse design
(property-to-structure mapping). This problem, critical to materials
informatics, demands finding complex, feasible input vectors that lie on the
Pareto optimal front. While LLMs have demonstrated universal effectiveness
across generative and reasoning tasks, their utility in constrained,
continuous, high-dimensional numerical spaces tasks they weren't explicitly
architected for remains an open research question. We conducted a rigorous
comparative study between established Bayesian Optimization (BO) frameworks and
a suite of fine-tuned LLMs and BERT models. For BO, we benchmarked the
foundational BoTorch Ax implementation against the state-of-the-art q-Expected
Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI, BoTorchM). The generative approach involved
fine-tuning models via Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), framing the
challenge as a regression problem with a custom output head. Our results show
that BoTorch qEHVI achieved perfect convergence (GD=0.0), setting the
performance ceiling. Crucially, the best-performing LLM (WizardMath-7B)
achieved a Generational Distance (GD) of 1.21, significantly outperforming the
traditional BoTorch Ax baseline (GD=15.03). We conclude that specialized BO
frameworks remain the performance leader for guaranteed convergence, but
fine-tuned LLMs are validated as a promising, computationally fast alternative,
contributing essential comparative metrics to the field of AI-driven
optimization. The findings have direct industrial applications in optimizing
formulation design for resins, polymers, and paints, where multi-objective
trade-offs between mechanical, rheological, and chemical properties are
critical to innovation and production efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lo-Hp, a decoupled two-stage framework for generating neural network weights, addressing problems like over-coupling and inefficiency in previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for neural network weight generation struggle with issues like over-coupling to task-specific objectives and inefficiency due to long-horizon dependencies.

Method: Lo-Hp uses a hybrid-policy sub-trajectory balance objective that combines on-policy and off-policy learning to capture local optimization policies.

Result: Lo-Hp demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency in tasks requiring frequent weight updates, such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and language model adaptation.

Conclusion: Focusing on local optimization policies mitigates long-horizon issues and improves the generation of globally optimal weights, enhancing the flexibility and performance of neural network weight generation frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable neural networks to generate
weights without relying on gradient-based optimization. However, current
methods are limited by issues of over-coupling and long-horizon. The former
tightly binds weight generation with task-specific objectives, thereby limiting
the flexibility of the learned optimizer. The latter leads to inefficiency and
low accuracy during inference, caused by the lack of local constraints. In this
paper, we propose Lo-Hp, a decoupled two-stage weight generation framework that
enhances flexibility through learning various optimization policies. It adopts
a hybrid-policy sub-trajectory balance objective, which integrates on-policy
and off-policy learning to capture local optimization policies. Theoretically,
we demonstrate that learning solely local optimization policies can address the
long-horizon issue while enhancing the generation of global optimal weights. In
addition, we validate Lo-Hp's superior accuracy and inference efficiency in
tasks that require frequent weight updates, such as transfer learning, few-shot
learning, domain generalization, and large language model adaptation.

*Ertugrul Mutlu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unconventional approach to detect parity using wavelet feature extraction and unsupervised k-means clustering, achieving 69.67% accuracy without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how classical signal-processing techniques can be repurposed for unconventional machine learning problems, specifically in detecting structural differences in symbolic domains like parity detection.

Method: The method transforms integers into wavelet-domain representations, extracts multi-scale statistical features, and employs k-means clustering to classify numbers as odd or even without supervised learning.

Result: The analysis reveals meaningful structural distinctions between odd and even numbers in the feature space, achieving a 69.67% classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of adapting signal-processing tools like wavelet analysis for discrete symbolic domains, showcasing its broader application beyond traditional continuous data problems.

Abstract: This paper explores a deliberately over-engineered approach to the classical
problem of parity detection -- determining whether a number is odd or even --
by combining wavelet-based feature extraction with unsupervised clustering.
Instead of relying on modular arithmetic, integers are transformed into
wavelet-domain representations, from which multi-scale statistical features are
extracted and clustered using the k-means algorithm. The resulting feature
space reveals meaningful structural differences between odd and even numbers,
achieving a classification accuracy of approximately 69.67% without any label
supervision. These results suggest that classical signal-processing techniques,
originally designed for continuous data, can uncover latent structure even in
purely discrete symbolic domains. Beyond parity detection, the study provides

### [247] [Sparse and nonparametric estimation of equations governing dynamical systems with applications to biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00579)
*G. Pillonetto,A. Giaretta,A. Aravkin,M. Bisiacco,T. Elston*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers propose a hybrid framework combining sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques to effectively capture the dynamics of complex systems, particularly in biology, overcoming limitations of traditional parametric models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to model complex biological systems, where traditional bottom-up modeling approaches and parametric techniques fail to handle inherent nonlinearities.

Method: The proposed framework integrates the Sindy algorithm's sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques, enabling the capture of nonlinear system dynamics without predefining a library of functional forms.

Result: The framework successfully identifies complex nonlinearities that traditional parametric models struggle with, showcasing its efficacy with examples from biological phenomena.

Conclusion: This hybrid approach enhances model discovery by bridging the gap between parametric and nonparametric methodologies, improving applicability in systems biology and other fields dealing with dynamic complexities.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of model equations is a powerful approach for
understanding the behavior of dynamical systems in many scientific fields. In
particular, the ability to learn mathematical models from data would benefit
systems biology, where the complex nature of these systems often makes a bottom
up approach to modeling unfeasible. In recent years, sparse estimation
techniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using
parametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model
complexity. In particular, the Sindy algorithm has successfully used sparsity
to estimate nonlinear systems by extracting from a library of functions only a
few key terms needed to capture the dynamics of these systems. However,
parametric models often fall short in accurately representing certain
nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel framework that integrates sparse parametric estimation with
nonparametric techniques. It captures nonlinearities that Sindy cannot describe
without requiring a priori information about their functional form. That is,
without expanding the library of functions to include the one that is trying to
be discovered. We illustrate our approach on several examples related to
estimation of complex biological phenomena.

### [248] [Edge AI in Highly Volatile Environments: Is Fairness Worth the Accuracy Trade-off?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01737)
*Obaidullah Zaland,Feras M. Awaysheh,Sawsan Al Zubi,Abdul Rahman Safi,Monowar Bhuyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the trade-offs between fairness, model performance, and speed in federated learning across volatile edge environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge environments are highly dynamic and heterogeneous, causing challenges in achieving equitable client participation and maintaining model accuracy.

Method: The paper evaluates fairness-based client selection algorithms like RBFF and RBCSF, comparing them to random and greedy selections using datasets CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and EMNIST.

Result: Fairness-based methods marginally improve equity among clients but result in slower global training in volatile conditions.

Conclusion: Fair client selection strategies require balancing fairness and performance potential, with future work needed to optimize the trade-offs in FL settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for edge
intelligence, enabling collaborative model training while preserving data
privacy across distributed personal devices. However, the inherent volatility
of edge environments, characterized by dynamic resource availability and
heterogeneous client capabilities, poses significant challenges for achieving
high accuracy and fairness in client participation. This paper investigates the
fundamental trade-off between model accuracy and fairness in highly volatile
edge environments. This paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation of
fairness-based client selection algorithms such as RBFF and RBCSF against
random and greedy client selection regarding fairness, model performance, and
time, in three benchmarking datasets (CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and EMNIST). This
work aims to shed light on the fairness-performance and fairness-speed
trade-offs in a volatile edge environment and explore potential future research
opportunities to address existing pitfalls in \textit{fair client selection}
strategies in FL. Our results indicate that more equitable client selection
algorithms, while providing a marginally better opportunity among clients, can
result in slower global training in volatile environments\footnote{The code for

*Zihao Wan,Pau Tong Lin Xu,Fuwen Luo,Ziyue Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a Vision-language Model (VLM) to decode geometric programs from pictographic characters, achieving abstract visual understanding beyond pixel recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how Vision-language Models (VLMs) interpret geometric structures in visual information and their generalization abilities using pictographic characters.

Method: The model is trained to decompile raster images into geometric program representations using B'ézier curves, framed as a program synthesis task.

Result: The model outperformed strong baselines, including GPT-4, and successfully reconstructed ancient Oracle Bone Script characters, showcasing its ability to generalize.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the model acquires a transferable geometric grammar, suggesting an abstract structured visual comprehension, surpassing mere pixel-based pattern detection.

Abstract: While Vision-language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic
capabilities, their ability to interpret the underlying geometric structure of
visual information is less explored. Pictographic characters, which combine
visual form with symbolic structure, provide an ideal test case for this
capability. We formulate this visual recognition challenge in the mathematical
domain, where each character is represented by an executable program of
geometric primitives. This is framed as a program synthesis task, training a
VLM to decompile raster images into programs composed of B\'ezier curves. Our
model, acting as a "visual decompiler", demonstrates performance superior to
strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o. The most significant finding is
that when trained solely on modern Chinese characters, the model is able to
reconstruct ancient Oracle Bone Script in a zero-shot context. This
generalization provides strong evidence that the model acquires an abstract and
transferable geometric grammar, moving beyond pixel-level pattern recognition
to a more structured form of visual understanding.

### [250] [Belief Dynamics Reveal the Dual Nature of In-Context Learning and Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00617)
*Eric Bigelow,Daniel Wurgaft,YingQiao Wang,Noah Goodman,Tomer Ullman,Hidenori Tanaka,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified framework for controlling large language model (LLM) behavior using a Bayesian perspective, addressing both prompt-based and activation-based interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand whether the seemingly disparate methods of controlling LLMs (prompts vs. activation steering) can be unified under a broader framework and made predictive.

Method: The paper develops a Bayesian model where context-based interventions alter belief accumulation, and activation-based steering changes prior beliefs. The model is tested across different domains inspired by many-shot in-context learning studies.

Result: The study explains prior phenomena, such as sigmoidal learning curves, while predicting new ones like the additivity of interventions in log-belief space. It demonstrates dramatic behavioral shifts with minor intervention changes.

Conclusion: The findings provide a unified account of LLM control, improving the predictive understanding of interventions and offering empirical methodologies for future use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be controlled at inference time through
prompts (in-context learning) and internal activations (activation steering).
Different accounts have been proposed to explain these methods, yet their
common goal of controlling model behavior raises the question of whether these
seemingly disparate methodologies can be seen as specific instances of a
broader framework. Motivated by this, we develop a unifying, predictive account
of LLM control from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we posit that both
context- and activation-based interventions impact model behavior by altering
its belief in latent concepts: steering operates by changing concept priors,
while in-context learning leads to an accumulation of evidence. This results in
a closed-form Bayesian model that is highly predictive of LLM behavior across
context- and activation-based interventions in a set of domains inspired by
prior work on many-shot in-context learning. This model helps us explain prior
empirical phenomena - e.g., sigmoidal learning curves as in-context evidence
accumulates - while predicting novel ones - e.g., additivity of both
interventions in log-belief space, which results in distinct phases such that
sudden and dramatic behavioral shifts can be induced by slightly changing
intervention controls. Taken together, this work offers a unified account of
prompt-based and activation-based control of LLM behavior, and a methodology
for empirically predicting the effects of these interventions.

### [251] [flowengineR: A Modular and Extensible Framework for Fair and Reproducible Workflow Design in R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00079)
*Maximilian Willer,Peter Ruckdeschel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: flowengineR is an R package providing a modular framework for reproducible machine learning workflows, emphasizing fairness and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in algorithmic fairness, focusing on the lack of reproducibility and extensibility in existing toolkits.

Method: The package utilizes standardized engines for tasks like data splitting, training, evaluation, and reporting, ensuring modularity, interchangeability, and lightweight communication.

Result: flowengineR supports fairness research by enabling integration and comparison of methods while also generalizing to other metrics like explainability, robustness, and compliance.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, transparent, and extensible solution for building machine learning workflows, applicable beyond fairness to general data processing and evaluation needs.

Abstract: flowengineR is an R package designed to provide a modular and extensible
framework for building reproducible algorithmic workflows for general-purpose
machine learning pipelines. It is motivated by the rapidly evolving field of
algorithmic fairness where new metrics, mitigation strategies, and machine
learning methods continuously emerge. A central challenge in fairness, but also
far beyond, is that existing toolkits either focus narrowly on single
interventions or treat reproducibility and extensibility as secondary
considerations rather than core design principles. flowengineR addresses this
by introducing a unified architecture of standardized engines for data
splitting, execution, preprocessing, training, inprocessing, postprocessing,
evaluation, and reporting. Each engine encapsulates one methodological task yet
communicates via a lightweight interface, ensuring workflows remain
transparent, auditable, and easily extensible. Although implemented in R,
flowengineR builds on ideas from workflow languages (CWL, YAWL), graph-oriented
visual programming languages (KNIME), and R frameworks (BatchJobs, batchtools).
Its emphasis, however, is less on orchestrating engines for resilient parallel
execution but rather on the straightforward setup and management of distinct
engines as data structures. This orthogonalization enables distributed
responsibilities, independent development, and streamlined integration. In
fairness context, by structuring fairness methods as interchangeable engines,
flowengineR lets researchers integrate, compare, and evaluate interventions
across the modeling pipeline. At the same time, the architecture generalizes to
explainability, robustness, and compliance metrics without core modifications.
While motivated by fairness, it ultimately provides a general infrastructure
for any workflow context where reproducibility, transparency, and extensibility
are essential.

### [252] [Stochastic Shortest Path with Sparse Adversarial Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00637)
*Emmeran Johnson,Alberto Rumi,Ciara Pike-Burke,Patrick Rebeschini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the adversarial Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem under full-information feedback, proposing an $ell_r$-norm regularizer to account for cost sparsity, achieving improved regret scaling tied to sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adversarial SSP problems fail to adapt effectively to sparsity in state-action costs, leading to suboptimal regret scaling.

Method: A proposed $8ell_r$-norm regularizer replaces the commonly used negative-entropy, adapting to sparsity and improving regret bounds.

Result: Regret scaling shifts effectively from $8sqrt{8log SA}$ to $8sqrt{8log M}$, with $M$ representing sparse costs; additionally, a lower regret bound confirms the optimality of these bounds.

Conclusion: The approach captures the benefits of sparsity under known transitions, but in unknown transition settings, sparsity benefits are limited as regrets scale with $SA$ for all learners.

Abstract: We study the adversarial Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem with sparse
costs under full-information feedback. In the known transition setting,
existing bounds based on Online Mirror Descent (OMD) with negative-entropy
regularization scale with $\sqrt{\log S A}$, where $SA$ is the size of the
state-action space. While we show that this is optimal in the worst-case, this
bound fails to capture the benefits of sparsity when only a small number $M \ll
SA$ of state-action pairs incur cost. In fact, we also show that the
negative-entropy is inherently non-adaptive to sparsity: it provably incurs
regret scaling with $\sqrt{\log S}$ on sparse problems. Instead, we propose a
family of $\ell_r$-norm regularizers ($r \in (1,2)$) that adapts to the
sparsity and achieves regret scaling with $\sqrt{\log M}$ instead of
$\sqrt{\log SA}$. We show this is optimal via a matching lower bound,
highlighting that $M$ captures the effective dimension of the problem instead
of $SA$. Finally, in the unknown transition setting the benefits of sparsity
are limited: we prove that even on sparse problems, the minimax regret for any
learner scales polynomially with $SA$.

*Shakib Khan,A. Ben Hamza,Amr Youssef*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fix-GCN, a robust graph neural network model against adversarial attacks by leveraging fixed-point iteration and spectral modulation filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate graph structure and node features. The paper aims to address this vulnerability and enhance their robustness.

Method: The paper proposes Fix-GCN, which employs a spectral modulation filter and a fixed-point iteration mechanism to propagate features while preserving low-frequency structural information and mitigating high-frequency perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the resilience of Fix-GCN against adversarial attacks, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Fix-GCN is an efficient and flexible defense mechanism in graph neural networks that enhances robustness without additional memory or computational complexity.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant risk to the integrity and
performance of graph neural networks, particularly in tasks where graph
structure and node features are vulnerable to manipulation. In this paper, we
present a novel model, called fixed-point iterative graph convolutional network
(Fix-GCN), which achieves robustness against adversarial perturbations by
effectively capturing higher-order node neighborhood information in the graph
without additional memory or computational complexity. Specifically, we
introduce a versatile spectral modulation filter and derive the feature
propagation rule of our model using fixed-point iteration. Unlike traditional
defense mechanisms that rely on additional design elements to counteract
attacks, the proposed graph filter provides a flexible-pass filtering approach,
allowing it to selectively attenuate high-frequency components while preserving
low-frequency structural information in the graph signal. By iteratively
updating node representations, our model offers a flexible and efficient
framework for preserving essential graph information while mitigating the
impact of adversarial manipulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model through extensive experiments on various benchmark graph
datasets, showcasing its resilience against adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes whether extremely pruned Restricted Boltzmann Machines can maintain performance and identifies limitations in retraining pruned networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether simpler, sparser neural networks can achieve strong performance and reduce computational and environmental costs.

Method: The authors study Restricted Boltzmann Machines under extreme pruning conditions inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, investigating their generative performance and retraining capabilities.

Result: RBMs maintain high-quality performance under significant pruning (up to 80%), but networks fail to fully recover performance after retraining when further pruning is applied.

Conclusion: Sparse networks need early pruning during training for effective functionality, as retraining following pruning leads to constrained performance below networks trained from scratch.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have relied heavily on
increasingly large neural networks, raising concerns about their computational
and environmental costs. This paper investigates whether simpler, sparser
networks can maintain strong performance by studying Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBMs) under extreme pruning conditions. Inspired by the Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis, we demonstrate that RBMs can achieve high-quality generative
performance even when up to 80% of the connections are pruned before training,
confirming that they contain viable sub-networks. However, our experiments
reveal crucial limitations: trained networks cannot fully recover lost
performance through retraining once additional pruning is applied. We identify
a sharp transition above which the generative quality degrades abruptly when
pruning disrupts a minimal core of essential connections. Moreover, re-trained
networks remain constrained by the parameters originally learned performing
worse than networks trained from scratch at equivalent sparsity levels. These
results suggest that for sparse networks to work effectively, pruning should be
implemented early in training rather than attempted afterwards. Our findings
provide practical insights for the development of efficient neural
architectures and highlight the persistent influence of initial conditions on
network capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The RPG market is growing, and companies seek to integrate AI tools to improve player experience. Automating challenge-level assessment of opponents is a critical need, as current manual methods are resource-intensive.

Method: The paper constructs a new dataset for level estimation, introduces a human-inspired benchmark model, and employs ordinal regression techniques. A specialized evaluation grounded in RPG domain knowledge was also developed.

Result: State-of-the-art methods for ordinal regression are evaluated and compared against the human-inspired model, with performance assessed through a domain-specific evaluation framework.

Conclusion: Automating level estimation in RPGs is plausible, and the proposed methods can reduce reliance on resource-intensive manual testing, providing a scalable alternative for the industry.

Abstract: In recent years, the pen and paper RPG market has experienced significant
growth. As a result, companies are increasingly exploring the integration of AI
technologies to enhance player experience and gain a competitive edge.
  One of the key challenges faced by publishers is designing new opponents and
estimating their challenge level. Currently, there are no automated methods for
determining a monster's level; the only approaches used are based on manual
testing and expert evaluation. Although these manual methods can provide
reasonably accurate estimates, they are time-consuming and resource-intensive.
  Level prediction can be approached using ordinal regression techniques. This
thesis presents an overview and evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for this
task. It also details the construction of a dedicated dataset for level
estimation. Furthermore, a human-inspired model was developed to serve as a
benchmark, allowing comparison between machine learning algorithms and the
approach typically employed by pen and paper RPG publishers. In addition, a
specialized evaluation procedure, grounded in domain knowledge, was designed to
assess model performance and facilitate meaningful comparisons.

TL;DR: The paper investigates concept drift in Knowledge Tracing (KT) models using data from five academic years and finds that BKT is more stable over time compared to more complex models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of concept drift and changing student populations on Knowledge Tracing models in online learning platforms.

Method: Evaluated four KT models across five academic years, examining their susceptibility to concept drift and performance degradation.

Result: BKT demonstrated stability when applied to newer data, while attention-based models experienced faster predictive power degradation.

Conclusion: KT models are susceptible to concept drift, requiring more longitudinal evaluations. BKT proved to be the most resilient, and data is provided for future studies.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) has been an established problem in the educational
data mining field for decades, and it is commonly assumed that the underlying
learning process be- ing modeled remains static. Given the ever-changing land-
scape of online learning platforms (OLPs), we investigate how concept drift and
changing student populations can im- pact student behavior within an OLP
through testing model performance both within a single academic year and across
multiple academic years. Four well-studied KT models were applied to five
academic years of data to assess how suscep- tible KT models are to concept
drift. Through our analysis, we find that all four families of KT models can
exhibit de- graded performance, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) remains the
most stable KT model when applied to newer data, while more complex, attention
based models lose pre- dictive power significantly faster. To foster more
longitu- dinal evaluations of KT models, the data used to conduct our analysis

TL;DR: MaGNet, a novel model for stock trend prediction, employs advanced techniques to address market volatility, temporal dynamics, and inter-stock relationships, showcasing superior performance and returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges in stock trend prediction caused by market volatility, complex temporal dynamics, and intricate inter-stock relationships, which existing methods fail to adequately address.

Method: The authors propose MaGNet, a Mamba dual-hyperGraph Network incorporating (1) a MAGE block for dynamic contextual temporal modeling, (2) 2D Spatiotemporal Attention modules for precise multivariate and cross-stock feature fusion, and (3) a dual hypergraph framework for multi-scale relational learning.

Result: MaGNet demonstrated superior predictive performance, exceptional investment returns, and robust risk management capabilities when tested on six major stock indices, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MaGNet model effectively enhances stock trend prediction by integrating dynamic, multivariate, and multi-scale relational learning, proving to be a highly robust and profitable approach.

Abstract: Stock trend prediction is crucial for profitable trading strategies and
portfolio management yet remains challenging due to market volatility, complex
temporal dynamics and multifaceted inter-stock relationships. Existing methods
struggle to effectively capture temporal dependencies and dynamic inter-stock
interactions, often neglecting cross-sectional market influences, relying on
static correlations, employing uniform treatments of nodes and edges, and
conflating diverse relationships. This work introduces MaGNet, a novel Mamba
dual-hyperGraph Network for stock prediction, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a MAGE block, which leverages bidirectional Mamba with
adaptive gating mechanisms for contextual temporal modeling and integrates a
sparse Mixture-of-Experts layer to enable dynamic adaptation to diverse market
conditions, alongside multi-head attention for capturing global dependencies;
(2) Feature-wise and Stock-wise 2D Spatiotemporal Attention modules enable
precise fusion of multivariate features and cross-stock dependencies,
effectively enhancing informativeness while preserving intrinsic data
structures, bridging temporal modeling with relational reasoning; and (3) a
dual hypergraph framework consisting of the Temporal-Causal Hypergraph (TCH)
that captures fine-grained causal dependencies with temporal constraints, and
Global Probabilistic Hypergraph (GPH) that models market-wide patterns through
soft hyperedge assignments and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism,
jointly disentangling localized temporal influences from instantaneous global
structures for multi-scale relational learning. Extensive experiments on six
major stock indices demonstrate MaGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive performance and exceptional investment returns with
robust risk management capabilities. Codes available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances large language models (LLMs) by optimizing model combinations and collaboration architectures tailored to specific tasks under fixed budgets. A novel Agent-REINFORCE framework is introduced for efficiently identifying optimal collaboration graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in TTS often lack consideration for varying architectures and model combinations across tasks, leading to suboptimal efficiency and performance.

Method: Researchers formalize TTS optimization as a probabilistic graph search problem and propose Agent-REINFORCE, a framework using textual feedback to optimize multi-LLM collaboration graphs.

Result: Agent-REINFORCE surpasses traditional and LLM-based methods, demonstrating better sample efficiency, optimal graph identification, and superior balance between accuracy and inference latency.

Conclusion: Agent-REINFORCE provides a powerful tool for tailorable TTS by efficiently discovering optimal multi-LLM collaboration configurations to enhance task performance under computing constraints.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves large language models (LLMs) by allocating
additional computation during inference, typically through parallel,
sequential, or hybrid scaling. However, prior studies often assume fixed
collaboration architectures (e.g., topologies) and single-model usage,
overlooking that optimal architectures and model combinations can vary across
tasks. Therefore, we study the novel problem of searching for compute-optimal
model combinations and architectures in TTS under a fixed budget. We formalize
it as a multi-LLM collaboration graph, where nodes encode roles and LLM model
assignments, and edges capture information flow. This problem is challenging
because (i) the combinatorial search space is prohibitively large, and (ii)
task-specific requirements demand tailored designs. To address these, we
reformulate the problem as probabilistic graph optimization and, through pilot
experiments, derive three empirical insights into TTS collaboration graphs.
Guided by these insights, we propose Agent-REINFORCE, an LLM-agent-augmented
framework that mirrors the REINFORCE pipeline by mapping
sampling-gradient-update to sampling-feedback-update, where feedback serves as
a textual gradient to update the probabilistic graph and efficiently search for
optimal multi-LLM collaboration graphs. Experiments show that Agent-REINFORCE
outperforms both traditional and LLM-based baselines in sample efficiency and
search performance, and effectively identifies optimal graphs under joint
objectives of accuracy and inference latency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "GraphKeeper," a novel framework tackling graph domain-incremental learning by addressing catastrophic forgetting through embedding stability and decision boundary maintenance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph incremental learning approaches are limited to task- or class-incremental scenarios in single domains, overlooking the critical need for domain-incremental learning across multiple graph domains, as required by graph foundation models.

Method: GraphKeeper implements domain-specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning, intra- and inter-domain disentanglement objectives, deviation-free knowledge preservation, and domain-aware distribution discrimination to ensure robust learning across incremental graph domains.

Result: GraphKeeper outperforms the runner-up by 6.5%~16.6% with minimal forgetting and demonstrates compatibility with various graph foundation models, confirming its effectiveness and applicability.

Conclusion: GraphKeeper effectively addresses challenges in graph domain-incremental learning, setting a benchmark in preventing catastrophic forgetting and reinforcing its potential use with diverse graph models.

Abstract: Graph incremental learning (GIL), which continuously updates graph models by
sequential knowledge acquisition, has garnered significant interest recently.
However, existing GIL approaches focus on task-incremental and
class-incremental scenarios within a single domain. Graph domain-incremental
learning (Domain-IL), aiming at updating models across multiple graph domains,
has become critical with the development of graph foundation models (GFMs), but
remains unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we propose Graph
Domain-Incremental Learning via Knowledge Dientanglement and Preservation
(GraphKeeper), to address catastrophic forgetting in Domain-IL scenario from
the perspectives of embedding shifts and decision boundary deviations.
Specifically, to prevent embedding shifts and confusion across incremental
graph domains, we first propose the domain-specific parameter-efficient
fine-tuning together with intra- and inter-domain disentanglement objectives.
Consequently, to maintain a stable decision boundary, we introduce
deviation-free knowledge preservation to continuously fit incremental domains.
Additionally, for graphs with unobservable domains, we perform domain-aware
distribution discrimination to obtain precise embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the proposed GraphKeeper achieves state-of-the-art results with
6.5%~16.6% improvement over the runner-up with negligible forgetting. Moreover,
we show GraphKeeper can be seamlessly integrated with various representative
GFMs, highlighting its broad applicative potential.

TL;DR: The paper examines spiking neural networks (SNNs), highlighting their stability and robustness through an analysis of their Fourier spectrum, and introduces the concept of spectral simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in understanding the theoretical foundations of spiking neural networks (SNNs), specifically in terms of stability and robustness, as compared to artificial neural networks.

Method: The authors study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs using Boolean function analysis, focusing on noise sensitivity and the impact of input perturbations on outputs. They analyze the Fourier spectrum to quantify this behavior.

Result: The paper demonstrates that wide LIF-SNN classifiers are stable on average due to the concentration of their Fourier spectrum on low-frequency components. Experiments on trained networks also validate the persistence of this stability.

Conclusion: The study highlights that SNNs possess inherent stability and spectral simplicity, where random LIF-SNNs are biased toward simple functions, providing new insights into their robustness and energy-efficient potentials.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising paradigm for energy-efficient
computation, yet their theoretical foundations-especially regarding stability
and robustness-remain limited compared to artificial neural networks. In this
work, we study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs through the
lens of Boolean function analysis. We focus on noise sensitivity and stability
in classification tasks, quantifying how input perturbations affect outputs.
Our main result shows that wide LIF-SNN classifiers are stable on average, a
property explained by the concentration of their Fourier spectrum on
low-frequency components. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of
spectral simplicity, which formalizes simplicity in terms of Fourier spectrum
concentration and connects our analysis to the simplicity bias observed in deep
networks. Within this framework, we show that random LIF-SNNs are biased toward
simple functions. Experiments on trained networks confirm that these stability
properties persist in practice. Together, these results provide new insights
into the stability and robustness properties of SNNs.

Motivation: Current AI-based digital twinning approaches face challenges due to limited measurements, lack of physics knowledge, and unknown damage states. This research addresses these uncertainties.

Method: An unsupervised framework is applied to the Z24 Bridge's structural health monitoring data, with conditional convergence of damage levels and secondary validation through support vector machine classifiers and principal component analysis.

Result: The approach accurately detects damage states over healthy measurements, facilitates digital twinning, and generates machine learning data for damage detection.

Conclusion: This method enhances system-level monitoring and infrastructure resilience, proving effective for practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The optimization-based damage detection and damage state digital twinning
capabilities are examined here of a novel conditional-labeled generative
adversarial network methodology. The framework outperforms current approaches
for fault anomaly detection as no prior information is required for the health
state of the system: a topic of high significance for real-world applications.
Specifically, current artificial intelligence-based digital twinning approaches
suffer from the uncertainty related to obtaining poor predictions when a low
number of measurements is available, physics knowledge is missing, or when the
damage state is unknown. To this end, an unsupervised framework is examined and
validated rigorously on the benchmark structural health monitoring measurements
of Z24 Bridge: a post-tensioned concrete highway bridge in Switzerland. In
implementing the approach, firstly, different same damage-level measurements
are used as inputs, while the model is forced to converge conditionally to two
different damage states. Secondly, the process is repeated for a different
group of measurements. Finally, the convergence scores are compared to identify
which one belongs to a different damage state. The process for both
healthy-to-healthy and damage-to-healthy input data creates, simultaneously,
measurements for digital twinning purposes at different damage states, capable
of pattern recognition and machine learning data generation. Further to this
process, a support vector machine classifier and a principal component analysis
procedure is developed to assess the generated and real measurements of each
damage category, serving as a secondary new dynamics learning indicator in
damage scenarios. Importantly, the approach is shown to capture accurately
damage over healthy measurements, providing a powerful tool for vibration-based
system-level monitoring and scalable infrastructure resilience.

### [262] [The Hidden Power of Normalization: Exponential Capacity Control in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00958)
*Khoat Than*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Normalization methods reduce the Lipschitz constants of DNNs exponentially by smoothing optimization and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the underlying mechanism and theoretical benefits of normalization methods in deep learning, especially with multiple normalization layers.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework focusing on the Lipschitz constant to analyze normalization's impact in controlling capacity in DNNs.

Result: Normalization exponentially reduces the Lipschitz constant, leading to smoother loss landscapes and constrained network capacity.

Conclusion: Normalization enhances optimization stability and generalization performance, explaining its empirical benefits in DNN architectures.

Abstract: Normalization methods are fundamental components of modern deep neural
networks (DNNs). Empirically, they are known to stabilize optimization dynamics
and improve generalization. However, the underlying theoretical mechanism by
which normalization contributes to both optimization and generalization remains
largely unexplained, especially when using many normalization layers in a DNN
architecture.
  In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that elucidates the role of
normalization through the lens of capacity control. We prove that an
unnormalized DNN can exhibit exponentially large Lipschitz constants with
respect to either its parameters or inputs, implying excessive functional
capacity and potential overfitting. Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In
contrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the
Lipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization
operations. This exponential reduction yields two fundamental consequences: (1)
it smooths the loss landscape at an exponential rate, facilitating faster and
more stable optimization; and (2) it constrains the effective capacity of the
network, thereby enhancing generalization guarantees on unseen data. Our
results thus offer a principled explanation for the empirical success of
normalization methods in deep learning.

TL;DR: The study compares neural networks (GRU, LSTM, CNN) with the physics-based residual Kalman Filter (RKF) for structural load identification under small dataset conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges faced in dynamic load identification in civil engineering applications, especially when data availability is limited or structural models are unidentifiable.

Method: The study compares neural networks (GRU, LSTM, CNN) and RKF using three scenarios: a simulated structure under shaker excitation, a California building under seismic excitation, and a benchmark problem under impact and instant loading.

Result: The study found that neural networks and RKF excel in different conditions. RKF outperformed the networks in physically parametrized and identifiable cases, while neural networks showed superior performance in other scenarios.

Conclusion: The combined approach of RKF and neural networks offers a comprehensive solution for dynamic load identification by leveraging strengths of both physics-based and data-driven methods.

Abstract: The dynamic structural load identification capabilities of the gated
recurrent unit, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural networks are
examined herein. The examination is on realistic small dataset training
conditions and on a comparative view to the physics-based residual Kalman
filter (RKF). The dynamic load identification suffers from the uncertainty
related to obtaining poor predictions when in civil engineering applications
only a low number of tests are performed or are available, or when the
structural model is unidentifiable. In considering the methods, first, a
simulated structure is investigated under a shaker excitation at the top floor.
Second, a building in California is investigated under seismic base excitation,
which results in loading for all degrees of freedom. Finally, the International
Association for Structural Control-American Society of Civil Engineers
(IASC-ASCE) structural health monitoring benchmark problem is examined for
impact and instant loading conditions. Importantly, the methods are shown to
outperform each other on different loading scenarios, while the RKF is shown to
outperform the networks in physically parametrized identifiable cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Loquetier, a framework that combines fine-tuning and inference for LoRA-based models, optimizing computational efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a gap in unifying fine-tuning and inference for LoRA-based models, despite its widespread use and the importance of integrating LLM training and serving.

Method: The authors propose Loquetier, a virtualized multi-LoRA framework with two components: a Virtualized Module for adapter isolation and kernel optimization for efficient computation during fine-tuning and inference.

Result: Loquetier outperforms existing methods by achieving up to 3x throughput on inference-only tasks and 46.4x higher SLO attainment for unified fine-tuning and inference tasks.

Conclusion: Loquetier offers a seamless integration of fine-tuning and inference for LoRA-based models, improving performance, flexibility, and efficiency in related tasks.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks. While prior work has explored strategies for integrating LLM
training and serving, there still remains a gap in unifying fine-tuning and
inference for LoRA-based models. We present Loquetier, a virtualized multi-LoRA
framework that seamlessly integrates LoRA fine-tuning and serving within a
single runtime. Loquetier introduces two key components: (1) a Virtualized
Module that isolates PEFT-based modifications and supports multiple adapters on
a shared base model, and (2) an optimized computation flow with a kernel design
that merges fine-tuning and inference paths in forward propagation, enabling
efficient batching and minimizing kernel invocation overhead. Extensive
experiments across three task settings show that Loquetier consistently
outperforms existing baselines in both performance and flexibility, achieving
up to $3.0\times$ the throughput of the state-of-the-art co-serving system on
inference-only tasks and $46.4\times$ higher SLO attainment than PEFT on
unified fine-tuning and inference tasks. The implementation of Loquetier is
publicly available at https://github.com/NJUDeepEngine/Loquetier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate deep linear network dynamics and establish a common mathematical framework connecting deep learning and linear systems theory.

Method: Leveraging geometric invariant theory and the Kempf-Ness theorem, the L2 regularizer is linked to minimizing on balanced manifolds while decomposing training dynamics into distinct gradient flows.

Result: The regularizing flow is solvable via the moment map, enabling the interpretation of balancedness principles.

Conclusion: This framework bridges between deep learning concepts and principles like model reduction and Bayesian perspectives.

Abstract: We use geometric invariant theory (GIT) to study the deep linear network
(DLN). The Kempf-Ness theorem is used to establish that the $L^2$ regularizer
is minimized on the balanced manifold. This allows us to decompose the training
dynamics into two distinct gradient flows: a regularizing flow on fibers and a
learning flow on the balanced manifold. We show that the regularizing flow is
exactly solvable using the moment map.
  This approach provides a common mathematical framework for balancedness in
deep learning and linear systems theory. We use this framework to interpret
balancedness in terms of model reduction and Bayesian principles.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework to discover conserved quantities from noisy trajectory data using Neural ODEs, Transformers, and symbolic-numeric verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying conserved quantities from observational data is crucial for scientific advancement but remains difficult, especially with noisy data.

Method: The framework includes a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation to learn dynamics, a Transformer to propose symbolic invariants, and a symbolic-numeric verifier for validation.

Result: Testing on physical systems shows this approach strongly outperforms baselines operating on trajectory data.

Conclusion: A decoupled approach combining learning and searching can effectively discover mathematical principles from imperfect data.

Abstract: The discovery of conservation laws is a cornerstone of scientific progress.
However, identifying these invariants from observational data remains a
significant challenge. We propose a hybrid framework to automate the discovery
of conserved quantities from noisy trajectory data. Our approach integrates
three components: (1) a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that
learns a continuous model of the system's dynamics, (2) a Transformer that
generates symbolic candidate invariants conditioned on the learned vector
field, and (3) a symbolic-numeric verifier that provides a strong numerical
certificate for the validity of these candidates. We test our framework on
canonical physical systems and show that it significantly outperforms baselines
that operate directly on trajectory data. This work demonstrates the robustness
of a decoupled learn-then-search approach for discovering mathematical
principles from imperfect data.

*Lijia Yu,Xiao-Shan Gao,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning expands the capabilities of transformers for all reasoning tasks. It concludes that some reasoning problems cannot benefit from CoT due to inherent limitations in memorization ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the full potential of CoT in enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly addressing whether CoT improves transformers in all reasoning scenarios.

Method: The authors analyze fixed-precision transformers with and without CoT by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for memorizing reasoning datasets, and provide bounds on parameters required for memorization. They also extend their study to infinite reasoning datasets.

Result: The study concludes that CoT does not universally enhance reasoning capabilities and establishes bounds for memorization tasks. Furthermore, certain infinite reasoning datasets are shown to be unmemorizable via transformers, with or without CoT.

Conclusion: CoT is not universally effective in improving reasoning power in transformers, as some reasoning tasks, both finite and infinite, resist enhancement by CoT paradigms.

Abstract: It has been shown that the chain of thought (CoT) can enhance the power of
large language models (LLMs) to solve certain mathematical reasoning problems.
However, the capacity of CoT is still not fully explored. As an important
instance, the following basic question has not yet been answered: Does CoT
expand the capability of transformers across all reasoning tasks? We
demonstrate that reasoning with transformers is essentially a memorization
problem for reasoning datasets. Thus, examining the power of CoT across all
reasoning tasks amounts to analyzing the memorization capabilities of CoT
transformers. In this paper, we give a complete description of the memorization
capabilities of fixed-precision transformers with or without CoT and give a
negative answer to the above-mentioned question. Precisely, we first give
necessary and sufficient conditions for fixed-precision transformers with and
without CoT to memorize a finite reasoning dataset and show that these two
conditions do not imply each other. Then, we give lower and upper bounds for
the number of parameters needed for transformers with or without CoT to
memorize a finite reasoning dataset with $N$ elements, which are
$\overline{\Theta}(N)$ in all cases. This implies that there exist reasoning
tasks for which CoT does not enhance the reasoning power of transformers,
leading to a negative answer to the above-mentioned question. Finally, we give
the first results on memorizing infinite reasoning datasets by CoT transformers
and show that some simple infinite datasets cannot be memorized by transformers
with or without CoT.

*Min Gan,Guang-Yong Chen,Yang Yi,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a principled geometric explanation for why variable elimination methods, like Variable Projection (VarPro), efficiently navigate non-convex optimization landscapes, emphasizing saddle point transformation as a core mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge presented by the proliferation of saddle points in large-scale non-convex optimization for machine learning, which obstructs convergence and stability.

Method: Using Hessian inertia and the Schur complement, the paper analyzes the critical point structure of optimization landscapes. The study includes theoretical insights, visualization, and practical validation on deep Residual Networks.

Result: Variable elimination fundamentally transforms saddle points into local maxima in the reduced optimization landscape, leading to improved stability and superior convergence in experiments, including deep neural network training.

Conclusion: The study positions landscape simplification and saddle point transformation as foundational principles for developing robust and efficient optimization algorithms.

Abstract: The proliferation of saddle points, rather than poor local minima, is
increasingly understood to be a primary obstacle in large-scale non-convex
optimization for machine learning. Variable elimination algorithms, like
Variable Projection (VarPro), have long been observed to exhibit superior
convergence and robustness in practice, yet a principled understanding of why
they so effectively navigate these complex energy landscapes has remained
elusive. In this work, we provide a rigorous geometric explanation by comparing
the optimization landscapes of the original and reduced formulations. Through a
rigorous analysis based on Hessian inertia and the Schur complement, we prove
that variable elimination fundamentally reshapes the critical point structure
of the objective function, revealing that local maxima in the reduced landscape
are created from, and correspond directly to, saddle points in the original
formulation. Our findings are illustrated on the canonical problem of
non-convex matrix factorization, visualized directly on two-parameter neural
networks, and finally validated in training deep Residual Networks, where our
approach yields dramatic improvements in stability and convergence to superior
minima. This work goes beyond explaining an existing method; it establishes
landscape simplification via saddle point transformation as a powerful
principle that can guide the design of a new generation of more robust and
efficient optimization algorithms.

*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MeixnerNet, a spectral Graph Neural Network using discrete orthogonal Meixner polynomials to address theoretical and practical mismatches in graph convolution approaches. It provides robust and adaptable performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the disconnect between continuous orthogonal polynomial filters (used in traditional spectral graph approaches) and their application to inherently discrete graph structures, leading to suboptimal performance and hyperparameter fragility.

Method: The proposed method employs Meixner polynomials with learnable shape parameters (beta and c), enabling adaptability to graph-specific spectral properties. A novel stabilization technique combining Laplacian scaling with per-basis LayerNorm is used to tackle numerical instability.

Result: MeixnerNet achieves competitive-to-superior performance against ChebyNet on benchmarks and demonstrates robust performance despite variations in hyperparameter settings (specifically the polynomial degree K).

Conclusion: MeixnerNet is a promising solution for addressing theoretical mismatches and performance fragility in spectral graph techniques, offering robust adaptability and improved results.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results
by defining graph convolutions in the spectral domain. A common approach,
popularized by ChebyNet, is to use polynomial filters based on continuous
orthogonal polynomials (e.g., Chebyshev). This creates a theoretical
disconnect, as these continuous-domain filters are applied to inherently
discrete graph structures. We hypothesize this mismatch can lead to suboptimal
performance and fragility to hyperparameter settings.
  In this paper, we introduce MeixnerNet, a novel spectral GNN architecture
that employs discrete orthogonal polynomials -- specifically, the Meixner
polynomials $M_k(x; \beta, c)$. Our model makes the two key shape parameters of
the polynomial, beta and c, learnable, allowing the filter to adapt its
polynomial basis to the specific spectral properties of a given graph. We
overcome the significant numerical instability of these polynomials by
introducing a novel stabilization technique that combines Laplacian scaling
with per-basis LayerNorm.
  We demonstrate experimentally that MeixnerNet achieves
competitive-to-superior performance against the strong ChebyNet baseline at the
optimal K = 2 setting (winning on 2 out of 3 benchmarks). More critically, we
show that MeixnerNet is exceptionally robust to variations in the polynomial
degree K, a hyperparameter to which ChebyNet proves to be highly fragile,
collapsing in performance where MeixnerNet remains stable.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced online robust tensor recovery algorithm that efficiently restores traffic data by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations, achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current traffic data recovery methods, particularly the high resource demand of batch methods and performance issues in online methods when applied to large-scale real-world ITS data.

Method: The paper proposes a streaming framework-based online robust tensor recovery algorithm that utilizes global spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data to effectively recover missing and anomalous data.

Result: Experimental validation on three real-world traffic datasets shows that the proposed method achieves high recovery accuracy and improves computational efficiency by up to three orders of magnitude compared to traditional batch-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is scalable, efficient, and adaptable, making it an effective solution for enhancing traffic data quality in Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Abstract: Data quality is critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), as
complete and accurate traffic data underpin reliable decision-making in traffic
control and management. Recent advances in low-rank tensor recovery algorithms
have shown strong potential in capturing the inherent structure of
high-dimensional traffic data and restoring degraded observations. However,
traditional batch-based methods demand substantial computational and storage
resources, which limits their scalability in the face of continuously expanding
traffic data volumes. Moreover, recent online tensor recovery methods often
suffer from severe performance degradation in complex real-world scenarios due
to their insufficient exploitation of the intrinsic structural properties of
traffic data. To address these challenges, we reformulate the traffic data
recovery problem within a streaming framework, and propose a novel online
robust tensor recovery algorithm that simultaneously leverages both the global
spatio-temporal correlations and local consistency of traffic data, achieving
high recovery accuracy and significantly improved computational efficiency in
large-scale scenarios. Our method is capable of simultaneously handling missing
and anomalous values in traffic data, and demonstrates strong adaptability
across diverse missing patterns. Experimental results on three real-world
traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high recovery
accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency by up to three
orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art batch-based methods. These
findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and
effective solution for traffic data quality enhancement in ITS.

Result: DCcluster-Opt enables rigorous research in sustainable geo-temporal task scheduling, providing a testbed for developing next-gen solutions.

Conclusion: DCcluster-Opt supports sustainable computing solutions by enabling realistic validations of algorithms in high-fidelity simulations.

Abstract: The increasing energy demands and carbon footprint of large-scale AI require
intelligent workload management in globally distributed data centers. Yet
progress is limited by the absence of benchmarks that realistically capture the
interplay of time-varying environmental factors (grid carbon intensity,
electricity prices, weather), detailed data center physics (CPUs, GPUs, memory,
HVAC energy), and geo-distributed network dynamics (latency and transmission
costs). To bridge this gap, we present DCcluster-Opt: an open-source,
high-fidelity simulation benchmark for sustainable, geo-temporal task
scheduling. DCcluster-Opt combines curated real-world datasets, including AI
workload traces, grid carbon intensity, electricity markets, weather across 20
global regions, cloud transmission costs, and empirical network delay
parameters with physics-informed models of data center operations, enabling
rigorous and reproducible research in sustainable computing. It presents a
challenging scheduling problem where a top-level coordinating agent must
dynamically reassign or defer tasks that arrive with resource and service-level
agreement requirements across a configurable cluster of data centers to
optimize multiple objectives. The environment also models advanced components
such as heat recovery. A modular reward system enables an explicit study of
trade-offs among carbon emissions, energy costs, service level agreements, and
water use. It provides a Gymnasium API with baseline controllers, including
reinforcement learning and rule-based strategies, to support reproducible ML
research and a fair comparison of diverse algorithms. By offering a realistic,

*Daniel Busbib,Ami Wiesel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores Toeplitz covariance estimation using gradient descent (GD) in overparameterized models. Mild overparameterization ensures global convergence and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the potential of overparameterized gradient descent (GD) for solving Toeplitz covariance estimation, inspired by its success in deep learning.

Method: Model the covariance matrix as a sum of complex sinusoids and optimize parameters using GD, with added overparameterization and an accelerated variant with distinct learning rates.

Result: Mild overparameterization ($K=2P$ or $4P$) enables global convergence, and numerical experiments show better or comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Overparameterized GD offers a simple yet effective and scalable approach for Toeplitz covariance estimation, outperforming sophisticated methods in certain scenarios.

Abstract: We consider covariance estimation under Toeplitz structure. Numerous
sophisticated optimization methods have been developed to maximize the Gaussian
log-likelihood under Toeplitz constraints. In contrast, recent advances in deep
learning demonstrate the surprising power of simple gradient descent (GD)
applied to overparameterized models. Motivated by this trend, we revisit
Toeplitz covariance estimation through the lens of overparameterized GD. We
model the $P\times P$ covariance as a sum of $K$ complex sinusoids with
learnable parameters and optimize them via GD. We show that when $K = P$, GD
may converge to suboptimal solutions. However, mild overparameterization ($K =
2P$ or $4P$) consistently enables global convergence from random
initializations. We further propose an accelerated GD variant with separate
learning rates for amplitudes and frequencies. When frequencies are fixed and
only amplitudes are optimized, we prove that the optimization landscape is
asymptotically benign and any stationary point recovers the true covariance.
Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that overparameterized GD can match
or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods in challenging settings,
while remaining simple and scalable.

Method: A machine learning model using XGBoost classifier with 189 features (player positions, velocities, spatial configurations) was built. SHAP analysis was also employed.

Result: The model achieved an AUC of 0.982 and a Brier score of 0.015. It identified key factors contributing to 'Line Breaks', like offensive player speed and gaps in the defensive line.

Conclusion: 'Line Breaks' are strongly linked to scoring opportunities, offering a quantitative understanding of tactical football dynamics.

Abstract: In football, attacking teams attempt to break through the opponent's
defensive line to create scoring opportunities. This action, known as a Line
Break, is a critical indicator of offensive effectiveness and tactical
performance, yet previous studies have mainly focused on shots or goal
opportunities rather than on how teams break the defensive line. In this study,
we develop a machine learning model to predict Line Breaks using event and
tracking data from the 2023 J1 League season. The model incorporates 189
features, including player positions, velocities, and spatial configurations,
and employs an XGBoost classifier to estimate the probability of Line Breaks.
The proposed model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.982 and
a Brier score of 0.015. Furthermore, SHAP analysis revealed that factors such
as offensive player speed, gaps in the defensive line, and offensive players'
spatial distributions significantly contribute to the occurrence of Line
Breaks. Finally, we found a moderate positive correlation between the predicted
probability of being Line-Broken and the number of shots and crosses conceded
at the team level. These results suggest that Line Breaks are closely linked to
the creation of scoring opportunities and provide a quantitative framework for
understanding tactical dynamics in football.

### [277] [Cross-Treatment Effect Estimation for Multi-Category, Multi-Valued Causal Inference via Dynamic Neural Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01641)
*Xiaopeng Ke,Yihan Yu,Ruyue Zhang,Zhishuo Zhou,Fangzhou Shi,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces XTNet, a novel network architecture to better handle multi-category, multi-valued treatment effect estimation and demonstrates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches face challenges with complex cross-effects between treatments in multi-category, multi-valued setups. These methods are limited to binary or single-type treatments and struggle with scalability and evaluation frameworks.

Method: XTNet uses a cross-effect estimation module with dynamic masking and a decomposition strategy to separate basic effects from interactions. It enables efficient modeling of combinatorial interventions.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show XTNet's superior performance compared to baselines. Real-world A/B testing further validates its efficacy.

Conclusion: XTNet improves complex intervention scenarios through novel architecture and metrics, offering better treatment effect estimation consistency and accuracy.

Abstract: Counterfactual causal inference faces significant challenges when extended to
multi-category, multi-valued treatments, where complex cross-effects between
heterogeneous interventions are difficult to model. Existing methodologies
remain constrained to binary or single-type treatments and suffer from
restrictive assumptions, limited scalability, and inadequate evaluation
frameworks for complex intervention scenarios.
  We present XTNet, a novel network architecture for multi-category,
multi-valued treatment effect estimation. Our approach introduces a
cross-effect estimation module with dynamic masking mechanisms to capture
treatment interactions without restrictive structural assumptions. The
architecture employs a decomposition strategy separating basic effects from
cross-treatment interactions, enabling efficient modeling of combinatorial
treatment spaces. We also propose MCMV-AUCC, a suitable evaluation metric that
accounts for treatment costs and interaction effects. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that XTNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both ranking accuracy and effect
estimation quality. The results of the real-world A/B test further confirm its
effectiveness.

### [278] [Cross-fluctuation phase transitions reveal sampling dynamics in diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00124)
*Sai Niranjan Ramachandran,Manish Krishan Lal,Suvrit Sra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies sampling dynamics in score-based diffusion models using cross-fluctuations, identifying sharp transitions in distribution sampling and improving efficiency and tasks like classification and style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to understand and improve the sampling dynamics of distributions in score-based diffusion models and unify modern generative modeling with theoretical and statistical physics concepts.

Method: They used cross-fluctuations, a centered-moment statistic, to detect transitions in sampling dynamics, deriving closed-form equations for variance-preserving SDEs and applying them to enhance sampling efficiency, rare-class generation, classification, and style transfer.

Result: Sharp discrete sampling transitions were detected using cross-fluctuations, boosting efficiency, and improving class-conditional generation alongside zero-shot tasks like image classification and style transfer.

Conclusion: The framework unifies classical theories of Markov chain coupling and mixing with continuous dynamics, extending to stochastic SDEs and non-Markovian samplers, and promises practical improvements in generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: We analyse how the sampling dynamics of distributions evolve in score-based
diffusion models using cross-fluctuations, a centered-moment statistic from
statistical physics. Specifically, we show that starting from an unbiased
isotropic normal distribution, samples undergo sharp, discrete transitions,
eventually forming distinct events of a desired distribution while
progressively revealing finer structure. As this process is reversible, these
transitions also occur in reverse, where intermediate states progressively
merge, tracing a path back to the initial distribution. We demonstrate that
these transitions can be detected as discontinuities in $n^{\text{th}}$-order
cross-fluctuations. For variance-preserving SDEs, we derive a closed-form for
these cross-fluctuations that is efficiently computable for the reverse
trajectory. We find that detecting these transitions directly boosts sampling
efficiency, accelerates class-conditional and rare-class generation, and
improves two zero-shot tasks--image classification and style transfer--without
expensive grid search or retraining. We also show that this viewpoint unifies
classical coupling and mixing from finite Markov chains with continuous
dynamics while extending to stochastic SDEs and non Markovian samplers. Our
framework therefore bridges discrete Markov chain theory, phase analysis, and
modern generative modeling.

*Gabriel Nobis,Maximilian Springenberg,Arina Belova,Rembert Daems,Christoph Knochenhauer,Manfred Opper,Tolga Birdal,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models (FDBM) using fractional Brownian motion (fBM) for improved generative modeling and predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models using Brownian motion lack the ability to capture memory effects, long-range dependencies, roughness, and anomalous diffusion observed in real stochastic processes.

Method: The FDBM framework employs a Markovian approximation of fractional Brownian motion (MA-fBM) to construct non-Markovian generative diffusion bridges. It incorporates coupling-preserving bridges and Schrödinger bridge loss functions for paired and unpaired data tasks.

Result: FDBM outperforms Brownian-based baselines in tasks like predicting future protein conformations and unpaired image translation, showing superior RMSD for protein structures and improved FID for image translations.

Conclusion: FDBM provides a powerful and more accurate alternative to Brownian motion-based diffusion models for tasks involving complex dependencies and memory effects, with promising results in applications like structural biology and computer vision.

Abstract: We present Fractional Diffusion Bridge Models (FDBM), a novel generative
diffusion bridge framework driven by an approximation of the rich and
non-Markovian fractional Brownian motion (fBM). Real stochastic processes
exhibit a degree of memory effects (correlations in time), long-range
dependencies, roughness and anomalous diffusion phenomena that are not captured
in standard diffusion or bridge modeling due to the use of Brownian motion
(BM). As a remedy, leveraging a recent Markovian approximation of fBM (MA-fBM),
we construct FDBM that enable tractable inference while preserving the
non-Markovian nature of fBM. We prove the existence of a coupling-preserving
generative diffusion bridge and leverage it for future state prediction from
paired training data. We then extend our formulation to the Schr\"{o}dinger
bridge problem and derive a principled loss function to learn the unpaired data
translation. We evaluate FDBM on both tasks: predicting future protein
conformations from aligned data, and unpaired image translation. In both
settings, FDBM achieves superior performance compared to the Brownian
baselines, yielding lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of C$_\alpha$
atomic positions in protein structure prediction and lower Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) in unpaired image translation.

### [280] [Dynamic Model Selection for Trajectory Prediction via Pairwise Ranking and Meta-Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00126)
*Lu Bowen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic multi-expert framework is proposed to improve deep trajectory predictions in complex driving scenarios by adaptively selecting the best model, achieving notable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing deep trajectory predictors struggle with reliability in complex driving situations, and simpler physics-based models can sometimes perform better, especially in safety-critical urban contexts.

Method: A dynamic multi-expert gating system combines physics-informed LSTM, Transformer, and GameFormer. It uses internal model meta-features (stability, uncertainty) for adaptive model selection, formulated as a pairwise-ranking problem.

Result: The proposed system achieves a 9.5% reduction in Final Displacement Error (FDE) compared to GameFormer, and shows consistent improvements in both offline validation and open-loop evaluations.

Conclusion: Adaptive hybrid systems, utilizing expert selection, improve trajectory prediction reliability and outperform static single-model paradigms in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Recent deep trajectory predictors (e.g., Jiang et al., 2023; Zhou et al.,
2022) have achieved strong average accuracy but remain unreliable in complex
long-tail driving scenarios. These limitations reveal the weakness of the
prevailing "one-model-fits-all" paradigm, particularly in safety-critical urban
contexts where simpler physics-based models can occasionally outperform
advanced networks (Kalman, 1960). To bridge this gap, we propose a dynamic
multi-expert gating framework that adaptively selects the most reliable
trajectory predictor among a physics-informed LSTM, a Transformer, and a
fine-tuned GameFormer on a per-sample basis.
  Our method leverages internal model signals (meta-features) such as stability
and uncertainty (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016), which we demonstrate to be
substantially more informative than geometric scene descriptors. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate trajectory expert selection
as a pairwise-ranking problem over internal model signals (Burges et al.,
2005), directly optimizing decision quality without requiring post-hoc
calibration.
  Evaluated on the nuPlan-mini dataset (Caesar et al., 2021) with 1,287
samples, our LLM-enhanced tri-expert gate achieves a Final Displacement Error
(FDE) of 2.567 m, representing a 9.5 percent reduction over GameFormer (2.835
m), and realizes 57.8 percent of the oracle performance bound. In open-loop
simulations, after trajectory horizon alignment, the same configuration reduces
FDE on left-turn scenarios by approximately 10 percent, demonstrating
consistent improvements across both offline validation and open-loop
evaluation. These results indicate that adaptive hybrid systems enhance
trajectory reliability in safety-critical autonomous driving, providing a
practical pathway beyond static single-model paradigms.

*Zhi Wang,Chicheng Zhang,Ramya Korlakai Vinayak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework and algorithm for lifelong representation learning and analyzes its efficiency using a novel dimension concept, applicable to tasks like classification and regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a learner to identify shared task structures and utilize partial information in an online manner for lifelong learning.

Method: The paper proposes a simple algorithm leveraging multi-task empirical risk minimization, supported by a sample complexity bound based on the task-eluder dimension.

Result: The framework and algorithm are shown to be broadly applicable to diverse learning problems, including noisy classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: This study advances the theoretical understanding of lifelong representation learning by proposing scalable methods and analyzing their performance through novel mathematical constructs.

Abstract: In lifelong learning, a learner faces a sequence of tasks with shared
structure and aims to identify and leverage it to accelerate learning. We study
the setting where such structure is captured by a common representation of
data. Unlike multi-task learning or learning-to-learn, where tasks are
available upfront to learn the representation, lifelong learning requires the
learner to make use of its existing knowledge while continually gathering
partial information in an online fashion. In this paper, we consider a
generalized framework of lifelong representation learning. We propose a simple
algorithm that uses multi-task empirical risk minimization as a subroutine and
establish a sample complexity bound based on a new notion we introduce--the
task-eluder dimension. Our result applies to a wide range of learning problems
involving general function classes. As concrete examples, we instantiate our
result on classification and regression tasks under noise.

*Siyu Xiao,Xindi Zhao,Tianhao Mao,Yiwei Wang,Yuqiao Chen,Hongyun Zhang,Jian Wang,Junjie Wang,Shuang Liu,Tupei Chen,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes novel data preprocessing methods to improve neural network-based casing collar locator (CCL) signal recognition, enhancing depth measurement accuracy in oil and gas operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural network methods for CCL signal recognition lack advanced preprocessing techniques and struggle with limited real well data for training, which hinders model development and performance.

Method: The study introduces data preprocessing methods such as standardization, label distribution smoothing, and data augmentation techniques. These methods are combined with AlexNet-based neural network models and evaluated through systematic experiments.

Result: The preprocessing methods increased the F1 scores of two benchmark models from 0.937 and 0.952 to a perfect 1.0. Effective generalization was verified using real CCL waveform data, confirming the practical applicability of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the challenges of limited CCL data and improve neural network model performance, demonstrating their suitability for real-world downhole operations.

Abstract: Accurate downhole depth measurement is essential for oil and gas well
operations, directly influencing reservoir contact, production efficiency, and
operational safety. Collar correlation using a casing collar locator (CCL) is
fundamental for precise depth calibration. While neural network-based CCL
signal recognition has achieved significant progress in collar identification,
preprocessing methods for such applications remain underdeveloped. Moreover,
the limited availability of real well data poses substantial challenges for
training neural network models that require extensive datasets. This paper
presents a system integrated into downhole tools for CCL signal acquisition to
facilitate dataset construction. We propose comprehensive preprocessing methods
for data augmentation and evaluate their effectiveness using our AlexNet-based
neural network models. Through systematic experimentation across various
configuration combinations, we analyze the contribution of each augmentation
method. Results demonstrate that standardization, label distribution smoothing
(LDS), and random cropping are fundamental requirements for model training,
while label smoothing regularization (LSR), time scaling, and multiple sampling
significantly enhance model generalization capability. The F1 scores of our two
benchmark models trained with the proposed augmentation methods maximumly
improve from 0.937 and 0.952 to 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. Performance
validation on real CCL waveforms confirms the effectiveness and practical
applicability of our approach. This work addresses the gaps in data
augmentation methodologies for training casing collar recognition models in CCL
data-limited environments.

### [283] [A Comparative Analysis of LLM Adaptation: SFT, LoRA, and ICL in Data-Scarce Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00130)
*Bernd Bohnet,Rumen Dangovski,Kevin Swersky,Sherry Moore,Arslan Chaudhry,Kathleen Kenealy,Noah Fiedel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) require tailored adaptation for specific tasks, and this paper compares key methods like Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and In-Context Learning (ICL). LoRA finds balance by effectively instilling new skills while minimizing base model degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need to adapt LLMs to specific tasks without compromising their general capabilities, particularly in data-scarce situations.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of three adaptation strategies: Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and In-Context Learning (ICL), assessing their impact on skill acquisition and knowledge integration.

Result: LoRA emerges as the most balanced method, achieving effective skill acquisition with minimal impact on general knowledge. SFT excels in skill acquisition but suffers from catastrophic forgetting, while ICL works well for factual knowledge but is less effective for complex skills.

Conclusion: The findings provide a pragmatic framework for choosing the appropriate LLM adaptation method, balancing task-specific performance against preserving general reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) often need to be
tailored for specific applications, requiring the integration of new knowledge
or the acquisition of new skills. While full fine-tuning is a powerful
adaptation method, it is computationally expensive and can lead to a
degradation of general reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic
forgetting. A range of alternative techniques exists, each with its own
trade-offs. In-Context Learning (ICL) is fast but limited by context length,
while Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) offer a middle ground by minimizing parameter changes. However, the
challenge of catastrophic forgetting persists, raising questions about the best
adaptation strategy for a given task. This paper presents a comparative
analysis of Supervised Finetuning (SFT), LoRA, and ICL in data-scarce
scenarios. We find that LoRA provides the most effective balance, successfully
instilling new skills with minimal impact on the base model's general
knowledge. In contrast, while SFT excels at skill acquisition, it is highly
susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. ICL is effective for incorporating
factual knowledge but struggles with complex skills. Our findings offer a
practical framework for selecting an LLM adaptation strategy. We highlight the
critical distinction between skill acquisition and knowledge integration,
clarify the trade-offs between task-specific performance and the preservation
of general capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges and limitations of conventional Random Forests by enhancing their ability to identify relevant signals from data and optimize hyperparameters adaptively.

Method: The proposed method integrates probabilistic feature sampling with dynamic hyperparameter configuration using Simulated Annealing to enhance the classification and generalization abilities of Random Forests.

Result: The results demonstrate improved accuracy, generalization, and insightful identification of feature relevance for robust classification across multiple domains.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines importance-aware feature selection with metaheuristic optimization, leading to consistent improvements in predictive performance and providing deeper insights into feature contributions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing Random Forest
classifiers by integrating probabilistic feature sampling and hyperparameter
tuning via Simulated Annealing. The proposed framework exhibits substantial
advancements in predictive accuracy and generalization, adeptly tackling the
multifaceted challenges of robust classification across diverse domains,
including credit risk evaluation, anomaly detection in IoT ecosystems,
early-stage medical diagnostics, and high-dimensional biological data analysis.
To overcome the limitations of conventional Random Forests, we present an
approach that places stronger emphasis on capturing the most relevant signals
from data while enabling adaptive hyperparameter configuration. The model is
guided towards features that contribute more meaningfully to classification and
optimizing this with dynamic parameter tuning. The results demonstrate
consistent accuracy improvements and meaningful insights into feature
relevance, showcasing the efficacy of combining importance aware sampling and
metaheuristic optimization.

### [285] [Physiologically Active Vegetation Reverses Its Cooling Effect in Humid Urban Climates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00134)
*Angana Borah,Adrija Datta,Ashish S. Kumar,Raviraj Dave,Udit Bhatia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vegetation cools surfaces but increases perceived heat stress due to humidity, with thresholds identified for urban greening strategies in Indian cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban greening efforts face challenges as vegetation cools surfaces but can increase humid heat stress, creating a need to understand vegetation's trade-off between cooling and moisture accumulation.

Method: The study uses a one-kilometre HI reconstruction and a machine-learning framework integrating SHAP and ALE to analyze the relationship between vegetation and heat stress in 138 Indian cities across varying climates and urban densities.

Result: The study finds cooling benefits for vegetation with specific structural thresholds (EVI >= 0.4, LAI >= 0.05), but highly active vegetation reverses cooling effects at higher thresholds (EVI >= 0.5, LAI >= 0.2, fPAR >= 0.5), particularly in humid dense urban cores.

Conclusion: There are climatic limits to vegetation's cooling impact, and the study provides thresholds to inform climate-specific and equitable urban greening strategies for heat resilience.

Abstract: Efforts to green cities for cooling are succeeding unevenly because the same
vegetation that cools surfaces can also intensify how hot the air feels.
Previous studies have identified humid heat as a growing urban hazard, yet how
physiologically active vegetation governs this trade-off between cooling and
moisture accumulation remains poorly understood, leaving mitigation policy and
design largely unguided. Here we quantify how vegetation structure and function
influence the Heat Index (HI), a combined measure of temperature and humidity
in 138 Indian cities spanning tropical savanna, semi-arid steppe, and humid
subtropical climates, and across dense urban cores and semi-urban rings. Using
an extreme-aware, one kilometre reconstruction of HI and an interpretable
machine-learning framework that integrates SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), we isolate vegetation-climate
interactions. Cooling generally strengthens for EVI >= 0.4 and LAI >= 0.05, but
joint-high regimes begin to reverse toward warming when EVI >= 0.5, LAI >= 0.2,
and fPAR >= 0.5,with an earlier onset for fPAR >= 0.25 in humid, dense cores.
In such environments, highly physiologically active vegetation elevates
near-surface humidity faster than it removes heat, reversing its cooling effect
and amplifying perceived heat stress. These findings establish the climatic
limits of vegetation-driven cooling and provide quantitative thresholds for
climate-specific greening strategies that promote equitable and heat-resilient
cities.

TL;DR: HeraldLight enhances traffic signal control using a dual LLM architecture, achieving reduced travel times and queue lengths compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize traffic signal control leveraging LLMs to address limitations of RL methods and fixed signal durations while improving interpretability and accuracy.

Method: Introduced HeraldLight, with a dual LLM architecture: LLM-Agent and LLM-Critic, combined with Herald-guided prompts for accuracy and robustness.

Result: Simulation results show HeraldLight reduced average travel time by 20.03% and queue length by 10.74% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: HeraldLight demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLMs for addressing TSC inefficiencies, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and improving traffic conditions significantly.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) in traffic signal control (TSC)
improves optimization efficiency and interpretability compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches are
limited by fixed time signal durations and are prone to hallucination errors,
while RL methods lack robustness in signal timing decisions and suffer from
poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
HeraldLight, a dual LLMs architecture enhanced by Herald guided prompts. The
Herald Module extracts contextual information and forecasts queue lengths for
each traffic phase based on real-time conditions. The first LLM, LLM-Agent,
uses these forecasts to make fine grained traffic signal control, while the
second LLM, LLM-Critic, refines LLM-Agent's outputs, correcting errors and
hallucinations. These refined outputs are used for score-based fine-tuning to
improve accuracy and robustness. Simulation experiments using CityFlow on real
world datasets covering 224 intersections in Jinan (12), Hangzhou (16), and New
York (196) demonstrate that HeraldLight outperforms state of the art baselines,
achieving a 20.03% reduction in average travel time across all scenarios and a
10.74% reduction in average queue length on the Jinan and Hangzhou scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in centralized redundant supply chains by enhancing decision-making and resource planning.

Method: Integrates deep learning, particle swarm optimization, linear programming, and hybrid mechanisms for feature extraction and optimization in supply chain networks.

Result: Simulations demonstrate reduced resource use, improved spatial planning, enhanced real-time decision adjustment, and robust dynamic control.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully optimizes both resource allocation and decision-making efficiency in supply chains.

Abstract: To improve decision-making and planning efficiency in back-end centralized
redundant supply chains, this paper proposes a decision model integrating deep
learning with intelligent particle swarm optimization. A distributed node
deployment model and optimal planning path are constructed for the supply chain
network. Deep learning such as convolutional neural networks extracts features
from historical data, and linear programming captures high-order statistical
features. The model is optimized using fuzzy association rule scheduling and
deep reinforcement learning, while neural networks fit dynamic changes. A
hybrid mechanism of "deep learning feature extraction - intelligent particle
swarm optimization" guides global optimization and selects optimal decisions
for adaptive control. Simulations show reduced resource consumption, enhanced
spatial planning, and in dynamic environments improved real-time decision
adjustment, distribution path optimization, and robust intelligent control.

### [288] [Can SAEs reveal and mitigate racial biases of LLMs in healthcare?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00177)
*Hiba Ahsan,Byron C. Wallace*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the risks of LLMs in healthcare, focusing on racial biases. It examines the use of Sparse Autoencoders to detect and manage problematic associations related to race in LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns related to racial bias in large language models (LLMs) used in healthcare, particularly focusing on how these models may rely on race for predictions.

Method: The authors studied Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify latent racial representations in LLM outputs and explored how these latents influence predictions, including testing methods to control biases through latent steering.

Result: They found that specific SAE latents correlated with African American racial references and could manipulate the model’s outputs, which heightened problematic associations such as predicting problematic traits about Black patients. The mitigation approaches via SAE steering worked in simple settings but failed in complex clinical tasks.

Conclusion: While SAEs can reveal racial biases in LLMs, steering latents is not highly effective for mitigating bias in intricate clinical scenarios, limiting practical applications.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly being used in healthcare. This promises to free
physicians from drudgery, enabling better care to be delivered at scale. But
the use of LLMs in this space also brings risks; for example, such models may
worsen existing biases. How can we spot when LLMs are (spuriously) relying on
patient race to inform predictions? In this work we assess the degree to which
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has
made between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in
Gemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that
this latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g., "African American")
but also problematic words like "incarceration". We then show that we can use
this latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and
further that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a
result. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to
the probability that a patient will become "belligerent". We evaluate the
degree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias.
We find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less
successful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks. Overall, our results
suggest that: SAEs may offer a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to
identify problematic reliance on demographics but mitigating bias via SAE
steering appears to be of marginal utility for realistic tasks.

TL;DR: PDE-SHARP reduces computational costs and enhances accuracy in solving PDEs using fewer numerical evaluations through LLM-based inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of traditional LLM-driven test-time approaches for solving complex PDEs.

Method: Three-stage framework: Analysis for mathematical insights, Genesis for solver generation, and Synthesis for iterative refinement of implementations.

Result: PDE-SHARP reduces solver evaluations by 60-75%, requires fewer than 13 evaluations on average, improves accuracy by 4×, and shows robust performance across different LLM architectures.

Conclusion: PDE-SHARP presents a cost-effective and accurate approach to PDE solving, significantly reducing numerical computations while enhancing overall solver performance.

Abstract: Current LLM-driven approaches using test-time computing to generate PDE
solvers execute a large number of solver samples to identify high-accuracy
solvers. These paradigms are especially costly for complex PDEs requiring
substantial computational resources for numerical evaluation. We introduce
PDE-SHARP, a framework to reduce computational costs by replacing expensive
scientific computation by cheaper LLM inference that achieves superior solver
accuracy with 60-75% fewer computational evaluations. PDE-SHARP employs three
stages: (1) Analysis: mathematical chain-of-thought analysis including PDE
classification, solution type detection, and stability analysis; (2) Genesis:
solver generation based on mathematical insights from the previous stage; and
(3) Synthesis: collaborative selection-hybridization tournaments in which LLM
judges iteratively refine implementations through flexible performance
feedback. To generate high-quality solvers, PDE-SHARP requires fewer than 13
solver evaluations on average compared to 30+ for baseline methods, improving
accuracy uniformly across tested PDEs by $4\times$ on average, and demonstrates
robust performance across LLM architectures, from general-purpose to
specialized reasoning models.

*Ali Satvaty,Suzan Verberne,Fatih Turkmen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel task: entity-level membership inference attacks in large language models (LLMs) specifically targeting sensitive information. A benchmark dataset was created to evaluate this, revealing limitations of existing methods and proposing two new techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance privacy auditing in LLMs, addressing gaps in detecting entity-level membership risks tied to sensitive attributes like PII or credit card details.

Method: The authors introduce the EL-MIA framework and construct a benchmark dataset systematically comparing existing MIA techniques and two newly proposed methods.

Result: Findings show existing MIA techniques are insufficient for entity-level tasks on sensitive attributes. However, simple methods can expose susceptibilities, calling for more robust adversarial models.

Conclusion: Current methods are inadequate for entity-level membership inference in sensitive cases, highlighting the necessity for stronger adversarial models to improve the evaluation of privacy risks in LLMs.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIA) aim to infer whether a particular data
point is part of the training dataset of a model. In this paper, we propose a
new task in the context of LLM privacy: entity-level discovery of membership
risk focused on sensitive information (PII, credit card numbers, etc). Existing
methods for MIA can detect the presence of entire prompts or documents in the
LLM training data, but they fail to capture risks at a finer granularity. We
propose the ``EL-MIA'' framework for auditing entity-level membership risks in
LLMs. We construct a benchmark dataset for the evaluation of MIA methods on
this task. Using this benchmark, we conduct a systematic comparison of existing
MIA techniques as well as two newly proposed methods. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of the results, trying to explain the relation of the
entity level MIA susceptability with the model scale, training epochs, and
other surface level factors. Our findings reveal that existing MIA methods are
limited when it comes to entity-level membership inference of the sensitive
attributes, while this susceptibility can be outlined with relatively
straightforward methods, highlighting the need for stronger adversaries to
stress test the provided threat model.

*Yiquan Wang,Yahui Ma,Yuhan Chang,Jiayao Yan,Jialin Zhang,Minnuo Cai,Kai Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models show promise for generative drug design but have distinct challenges across therapeutic domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating and transforming drug discovery processes using advanced generative frameworks.

Method: Systematic comparison of iterative denoising applications for therapeutic modalities like small molecules and peptides.

Result: Diffusion models enable novel drug designs but face hurdles like chemical synthesizability and biological stability.

Conclusion: Integrating diffusion models into closed-loop DBTL platforms is key to unlocking their potential for novel therapeutics development.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling,
showing significant potential to accelerate and transform the traditionally
slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic
comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic
modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We analyze how a unified
framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular
representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For
small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating
novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face
the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for
therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and
designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving
biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and
minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face
shared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of
high-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental
validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be
unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into
automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby
shifting the paradigm from chemical exploration to the targeted creation of
novel therapeutics.

*Pouya M. Ghari,Simone Sciabola,Ye Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to fine-tune foundation models using multiple reward signals, showing improved results across various fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many applications require multiple evaluation criteria for optimization, but traditional single-reward RL methods are suboptimal for such tasks.

Method: The paper introduces an iterative RL fine-tuning strategy using multiple reward signals, alongside theoretical analysis to understand its performance.

Result: Experimental results reveal significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in areas like text, biological sequence, and molecular generation.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-reward RL fine-tuning approach is effective and generalizes traditional RL-based methods, offering better performance in models with complex criteria.

Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models has emerged as a powerful approach for
generating objects with specific desired properties. Reinforcement learning
(RL) provides an effective framework for this purpose, enabling models to
generate outputs that maximize a given reward function. However, in many
applications such as text generation and drug discovery, it can be suboptimal
to optimize using a single reward signal, as multiple evaluation criteria are
often necessary. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based
method for fine-tuning foundation models using multiple reward signals. By
employing an iterative fine-tuning strategy across these rewards, our approach
generalizes state-of-the-art RL-based methods. We further provide a theoretical
analysis that offers insights into the performance of multi-reward RL
fine-tuning. Experimental results across diverse domains including text,
biological sequence, and small molecule generation, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A paper proposes an ensemble deep transfer learning model combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for reliable melanoma detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of melanoma is crucial for reducing mortality, but standard deep learning solutions face challenges in trust and reliability due to lack of explainability.

Method: An ensemble model using three state-of-the-art deep transfer learning networks paired with XAI techniques to ensure transparent and informed predictions.

Result: The approach achieves high accuracy in melanoma detection while providing interpretative insights into the decision-making process.

Conclusion: Integrating XAI techniques in DL-based models enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of melanoma detection systems in healthcare diagnostics.

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive and deadliest skin cancers, leading to
mortality if not detected and treated in the early stages. Artificial
intelligence techniques have recently been developed to help dermatologists in
the early detection of melanoma, and systems based on deep learning (DL) have
been able to detect these lesions with high accuracy. However, the entire
community must overcome the explainability limit to get the maximum benefit
from DL for diagnostics in the healthcare domain. Because of the black box
operation's shortcomings in DL models' decisions, there is a lack of
reliability and trust in the outcomes. However, Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) can solve this problem by interpreting the predictions of AI
systems. This paper proposes a machine learning model using ensemble learning
of three state-of-the-art deep transfer Learning networks, along with an
approach to ensure the reliability of the predictions by utilizing XAI
techniques to explain the basis of the predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel xLSTM-based framework for vehicle trajectory prediction, incorporating kinematic constraints for realistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional trajectory prediction methods and improve long-term temporal dependency modeling, especially for vehicle trajectory prediction tasks.

Method: The paper proposes X-TRAJ (an xLSTM-based framework) and X-TRACK (its physics-aware variant), integrating vehicle kinematics into the model to enhance realism.

Result: The X-TRACK framework demonstrated better performance and more realistic trajectory predictions compared to state-of-the-art baselines when evaluated on highD and NGSIM datasets.

Conclusion: By integrating physical constraints with advanced xLSTM methods, realistic and effective vehicle trajectory predictions can be achieved, advancing state-of-the-art methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures,
particularly the Extended Long Short Term Memory (xLSTM), have addressed the
limitations of traditional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks by
introducing exponential gating and enhanced memory structures. These
improvements make xLSTM suitable for time-series prediction tasks as they
exhibit the ability to model long-term temporal dependencies better than LSTMs.
Despite their potential, these xLSTM-based models remain largely unexplored in
the context of vehicle trajectory prediction. Therefore, this paper introduces
a novel xLSTM-based vehicle trajectory prediction framework, X-TRAJ, and its
physics-aware variant, X-TRACK (eXtended LSTM for TRAjectory prediction
Constraint by Kinematics), which explicitly integrates vehicle motion
kinematics into the model learning process. By introducing physical
constraints, the proposed model generates realistic and feasible trajectories.
A comprehensive evaluation on the highD and NGSIM datasets demonstrates that
X-TRACK outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [295] [Improving the Robustness of Control of Chaotic Convective Flows with Domain-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00272)
*Michiel Straat,Thorben Markmann,Sebastian Peitz,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using domain-informed reinforcement learning (RL) agents to control chaotic convective flows, achieving improved generalization, efficiency, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling chaotic convective flows is highly desirable for applications like microfluidics and chemical reactors, but conventional control methods often fail in chaotic regimes. RL's potential remains underexplored for robust control in such conditions.

Method: The authors train domain-informed RL agents using Proximal Policy Optimization on Rayleigh-Bénard Convection (RBC) models with diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. They integrate domain knowledge in the reward function, targeting Bénard cell merging as a favorable macroscopic property.

Result: Domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by 33% in laminar flow and achieve a 10% reduction in chaotic flow, outperforming conventional controllers. Additionally, they exhibit faster convergence and generalization without retraining.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-informed priors significantly improves the robustness and performance of RL-based control for chaotic flows, advancing applicability in real-world systems.

Abstract: Chaotic convective flows arise in many real-world systems, such as
microfluidic devices and chemical reactors. Stabilizing these flows is highly
desirable but remains challenging, particularly in chaotic regimes where
conventional control methods often fail. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown
promise for control in laminar flow settings, but its ability to generalize and
remain robust under chaotic and turbulent dynamics is not well explored,
despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we improve the
practical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on
Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat
transport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce
domain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization
across diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. We incorporate domain
knowledge in the reward function via a term that encourages B\'enard cell
merging, as an example of a desirable macroscopic property. In laminar flow
regimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up
to 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which
is significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We
compare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the
domain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence
during training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining. Our
work demonstrates that elegant domain-informed priors can greatly enhance the
robustness of RL-based control of chaotic flows, bringing real-world deployment
closer.

### [296] [Calibration Across Layers: Understanding Calibration Evolution in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00280)
*Abhinav Joshi,Areeb Ahmad,Ashutosh Modi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on how confidence evolves across network depth rather than only in the final layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are often overconfident, unlike LLMs which exhibit better calibration. Understanding calibration mechanisms in LLMs could improve reliability and interpretability.

Method: The study analyzes multiple open-weight models on the MMLU benchmark and investigates calibration progression, identifying a confidence correction phase and a low-dimensional calibration direction.

Result: The paper uncovers active confidence recalibration in upper layers and demonstrates enhanced calibration metrics (ECE and MCE) by perturbing the calibration direction without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Calibration in LLMs is distributed and shaped throughout the network, not restricted to the final projection phase, offering insights into confidence mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated inherent calibration
capabilities, where predicted probabilities align well with correctness,
despite prior findings that deep neural networks are often overconfident.
Recent studies have linked this behavior to specific components in the final
layer, such as entropy neurons and the unembedding matrix null space. In this
work, we provide a complementary perspective by investigating how calibration
evolves throughout the network depth. Analyzing multiple open-weight models on
the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a distinct confidence correction phase in the
upper/later layers, where model confidence is actively recalibrated after
decision certainty has been reached. Furthermore, we identify a low-dimensional
calibration direction in the residual stream whose perturbation significantly
improves calibration metrics (ECE and MCE) without harming accuracy. Our
findings suggest that calibration is a distributed phenomenon, shaped
throughout the network forward pass, not just in its final projection,
providing new insights into how confidence-regulating mechanisms operate within
LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of different uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques in deep learning models applied to medical time-series data for tasks like atrial fibrillation detection and blood pressure regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable uncertainty measures in deep learning models applied to medical time-series data to ensure trustworthy outputs and guide clinicians in practical scenarios.

Method: The authors implemented eight UQ techniques and formulated a comprehensive evaluation procedure to compare them on classification and regression tasks involving wearable medical sensor data.

Result: The study found that the effectiveness of UQ techniques varies depending on the task, uncertainty expression, reliability metric, and scale of reliability. Local calibration and adaptivity provided insights not captured by global metrics.

Conclusion: The evaluation criteria for UQ methods should align with the model's practical application, emphasizing small-scale reliability and predictive performance under constraints like limited patient measurements.

Abstract: In principle, deep learning models trained on medical time-series, including
wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor data, can provide a means to
continuously monitor physiological parameters outside of clinical settings.
However, there is considerable risk of poor performance when deployed in
practical measurement scenarios leading to negative patient outcomes. Reliable
uncertainties accompanying predictions can provide guidance to clinicians in
their interpretation of the trustworthiness of model outputs. It is therefore
of interest to compare the effectiveness of different approaches. Here we
implement an unprecedented set of eight uncertainty quantification (UQ)
techniques to models trained on two clinically relevant prediction tasks:
Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection (classification), and two variants of blood
pressure regression. We formulate a comprehensive evaluation procedure to
enable a rigorous comparison of these approaches. We observe a complex picture
of uncertainty reliability across the different techniques, where the most
optimal for a given task depends on the chosen expression of uncertainty,
evaluation metric, and scale of reliability assessed. We find that assessing
local calibration and adaptivity provides practically relevant insights about
model behaviour that otherwise cannot be acquired using more commonly
implemented global reliability metrics. We emphasise that criteria for
evaluating UQ techniques should cater to the model's practical use case, where
the use of a small number of measurements per patient places a premium on
achieving small-scale reliability for the chosen expression of uncertainty,
while preserving as much predictive performance as possible.

*Amir Ziashahabi,Yavuz Faruk Bakman,Duygu Nur Yaldiz,Mostafa El-Khamy,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy,Salman Avestimehr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper criticizes Speculative Decoding (SD) for overly strict distribution matching requirements that limit efficiency and proposes Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding, focusing on utility maximization and achieving higher speedups while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Speculative Decoding methods impose strict requirements on matching target model distributions, causing lower acceptance rates and limiting speed efficiency. The paper advocates for focusing on task-specific utility instead.

Method: The authors introduce Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding, identifying tokens critical to utility (pivot tokens) using a lightweight classifier to relax the strictness of standard SD, maintaining utility while improving efficiency.

Result: Experiments show that Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding achieves speedups of up to 2.5x while delivering comparable task-specific utility across various datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their approach balances speed and utility effectively, offering a more practical solution for real-world use cases of large language models, surpassing strict distribution-based decoding methods.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) ensures that the output matches the target model's
distribution exactly. However, we argue that this distribution matching
requirement is too stringent and results in unnecessarily low acceptance rates,
limiting potential speedups. Instead, we advocate a reformulation of the
decoding objective: the proposed decoding strategy should match the expected
utility, i.e., the task-specific performance, of the target model. This
perspective also aligns better with real-world use cases of LLMs, where utility
(e.g., code correctness, factual accuracy) is often more important than
sampling distribution. Based on this reformulation, we propose a novel decoding
strategy: Pivot-Aware Speculative Decoding, which rejects only those tokens
that would lead to a utility drop in the final output. We refer to these
critical tokens as pivot tokens. We propose a method for labeling tokens as
pivotal or non-pivotal and train a lightweight classifier to detect them. This
method can be viewed as a relaxed version of standard SD, which offers much
higher acceptance while preserving utility. We evaluate our method across
various datasets, demonstrating that we can achieve up to $2.5\times$ speedup
with comparable utility. Source code is available at

Abstract: We introduce PolyRecommender, a multimodal discovery framework that
integrates chemical language representations from PolyBERT with molecular
graph-based representations from a graph encoder. The system first retrieves
candidate polymers using language-based similarity and then ranks them using
fused multimodal embeddings according to multiple target properties. By
leveraging the complementary knowledge encoded in both modalities,
PolyRecommender enables efficient retrieval and robust ranking across related

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces UME-R1, a universal multimodal embedding framework designed to integrate generative reasoning capabilities into embeddings, offering significant performance gains across various multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models are limited by their discriminative nature, which restricts their ability to adopt reasoning-driven generative approaches for improved embeddings.

Method: The authors propose a generative embedding framework, UME-R1, employing a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning to incorporate reasoning abilities, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize performance and enhance generative embedding quality.

Result: The proposed UME-R1 framework demonstrates superior performance over traditional discriminative models, achieving notable gains on the MMEB-V2 benchmark across 78 tasks, and highlights improvements in task coverage and scalability with generative embeddings.

Conclusion: UME-R1 establishes a foundation for reasoning-driven generative multimodal embeddings, showing strong evidence of their advantages over conventional discriminative embeddings in terms of performance and interpretability.

Abstract: The remarkable success of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has driven
advances in multimodal embeddings, yet existing models remain inherently
discriminative, limiting their ability to benefit from reasoning-driven
generation paradigm. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of generative
embeddings, unifying embedding tasks within a generative paradigm. We propose
UME-R1, a universal multimodal embedding framework consisting of a two-stage
training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning equips the model with
reasoning capabilities and enables it to generate both discriminative and
generative embeddings; a subsequent reinforcement learning enhances reasoning
and further optimizes generative embedding quality. This pioneering work
reveals four key insights: 1) generative embeddings unlock substantial
performance gains over conventional discriminative embeddings by leveraging the
powerful generative reasoning capabilities of MLLMs; 2) discriminative and
generative embeddings are complementary, whose combined oracle performance far
exceeding that of either alone; 3) RL can effectively enhance generative
embeddings, establishing a scalable optimization paradigm.; 4) repeated
sampling at inference boosts downstream task coverage (pass@k), highlighting
the inference-time scalability potential of generative embeddings. Evaluated on
the MMEB-V2 benchmark across 78 tasks spanning video, image, and visual
documents, UME-R1 significantly outperforms conventional discriminative
embedding models and offers a foundation for more interpretable,
reasoning-driven generative multimodal embeddings. Our code, models, and
datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/UME-R1.

*Zenghao Niu,Weicheng Xie,Siyang Song,Zitong Yu,Feng Liu,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS) method to address the balance between attack potency and cross-model generalization in adversarial attacks, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple neural network architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge in adversarial attacks: resolving the trade-off between maximizing attack potency and ensuring cross-model generalization across different neural network architectures.

Method: The authors introduce a methodology called Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS) which integrates inner-iteration random sampling and gradient-guided direction from a previous iteration. This harmonizes exploration and exploitation in adversarial attacks, ensuring higher loss maxima and better generalization.

Result: The proposed GGS method outperforms state-of-the-art transfer attack methods when tested on diverse deep neural network architectures and multimodal large language models.

Conclusion: Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS) provides an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, improving the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a critical challenge to deep neural networks'
robustness, particularly in transfer scenarios across different model
architectures. However, the transferability of adversarial attacks faces a
fundamental dilemma between Exploitation (maximizing attack potency) and
Exploration (enhancing cross-model generalization). Traditional momentum-based
methods over-prioritize Exploitation, i.e., higher loss maxima for attack
potency but weakened generalization (narrow loss surface). Conversely, recent
methods with inner-iteration sampling over-prioritize Exploration, i.e.,
flatter loss surfaces for cross-model generalization but weakened attack
potency (suboptimal local maxima). To resolve this dilemma, we propose a simple
yet effective Gradient-Guided Sampling (GGS), which harmonizes both objectives
through guiding sampling along the gradient ascent direction to improve both
sampling efficiency and stability. Specifically, based on MI-FGSM, GGS
introduces inner-iteration random sampling and guides the sampling direction
using the gradient from the previous inner-iteration (the sampling's magnitude
is determined by a random distribution). This mechanism encourages adversarial
examples to reside in balanced regions with both flatness for cross-model
generalization and higher local maxima for strong attack potency. Comprehensive
experiments across multiple DNN architectures and multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
transfer attacks. Code is made available at https://github.com/anuin-cat/GGS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree Training to improve computation efficiency in agentic LLM scenarios by reusing shared prefix computations in tree-structured token trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods for agentic LLM models encounter inefficiencies due to repeated computation of shared prefixes in tree-like token trajectories.

Method: They propose Tree Packing for efficiently reusing computations and Gradient Restoration for proper gradient propagation across shared prefixes.

Result: Experiments show up to a 3.9x reduction in training time for agentic LLM SFT and RL training.

Conclusion: Tree Training streamlines large-scale agentic training, significantly enhancing computational efficiency through the reuse of intermediate results.

Abstract: In agentic LLM scenarios, an agent's interaction process during a single
rollout often exhibits branching behaviors. Due to memory retrieval and
concurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of
one task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence.
However, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories
into separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence.
As a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed
during both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we
propose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once
and reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward
and backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in
large-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which
efficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient
Restoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes.
Experiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in
total training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structure-preserving Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for solving the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, focusing on maintaining physical invariants like conservation of mass and Hamiltonian energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance shortcomings of conventional PINNs in preserving physical invariants during long-term integration of nonlinear PDEs.

Method: The proposed method integrates conservation of physical invariants into the loss function and utilizes sinusoidal activation functions for better spectral expressiveness, particularly suited for oscillatory and dispersive dynamics.

Result: The model accurately reproduces key behaviors of KdV dynamics, such as soliton propagation and interaction, while ensuring conservation laws and improving convergence, stability, and drift mitigation.

Conclusion: Invariant-aware optimization combined with sinusoidal feature mappings provides an effective and computationally efficient framework for energy-consistent PINNs targeting Hamiltonian PDEs like the KdV equation.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a flexible framework for
solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), yet conventional
implementations often fail to preserve key physical invariants during long-term
integration. This paper introduces a \emph{structure-preserving PINN} framework
for the nonlinear Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation, a prototypical model for
nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation. The proposed method embeds the
conservation of mass and Hamiltonian energy directly into the loss function,
ensuring physically consistent and energy-stable evolution throughout training
and prediction. Unlike standard \texttt{tanh}-based
PINNs~\cite{raissi2019pinn,wang2022modifiedpinn}, our approach employs
sinusoidal activation functions that enhance spectral expressiveness and
accurately capture the oscillatory and dispersive nature of KdV solitons.
Through representative case studies -- including single-soliton propagation
(shape-preserving translation), two-soliton interaction (elastic collision with
phase shift), and cosine-pulse initialization (nonlinear dispersive breakup) --
the model successfully reproduces hallmark behaviors of KdV dynamics while
maintaining conserved invariants. Ablation studies demonstrate that combining
invariant-constrained optimization with sinusoidal feature mappings accelerates
convergence, improves long-term stability, and mitigates drift without
multi-stage pretraining. These results highlight that computationally
efficient, invariant-aware regularization coupled with sinusoidal
representations yields robust, energy-consistent PINNs for Hamiltonian partial
differential equations such as the KdV equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite its importance in other Genetic Programming variants, crossover was considered detrimental for CGP. Previous methods lacked a general solution to improve crossover performance in CGP.

Method: The authors tested various crossover methods (e.g., one-point, uniform, and subgraph crossover) and mutation operators (traditional point mutation vs. node mutation) with and without node preservation.

Result: Methods involving node preservation improved search performance, particularly in symbolic regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: Node preservation-enhanced operations may pave the way for a general solution to enable effective CGP crossover.

Abstract: While crossover is a critical and often indispensable component in other
forms of Genetic Programming, such as Linear- and Tree-based, it has
consistently been claimed that it deteriorates search performance in CGP. As a
result, a mutation-alone $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary strategy has become the
canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that
demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general
solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic
crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are
``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth,
the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is
not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation
operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an
entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and
crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving
the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.

*Zainab Aizaz,James C. Knight,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel RISC-V-based system-on-chip platform, FeNN-DMA, optimized for efficient Spiking Neural Network (SNN) processing on FPGAs, demonstrating competitive resource usage and superior scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and the processing capabilities of standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.

Method: Developing FeNN-DMA, a RISC-V-based system-on-chip customized for simulating SNNs on UltraScale+ FPGAs, enabling better scalability and performance for memory-bound workloads.

Result: FeNN-DMA achieves comparable resource usage and energy efficiency to state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators while supporting larger, more complex models. It also delivers top-tier accuracy on specific classification tasks like Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Neuromorphic MNIST.

Conclusion: FeNN-DMA provides an energy-efficient and scalable solution for SNN simulations, outperforming traditional accelerators in handling complex, large models while maintaining high classification accuracy.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising, energy-efficient alternative
to standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and are particularly well-suited
to spatio-temporal tasks such as keyword spotting and video classification.
However, SNNs have a much lower arithmetic intensity than ANNs and are
therefore not well-matched to standard accelerators like GPUs and TPUs. Field
Programmable Gate Arrays(FPGAs) are designed for such memory-bound workloads
and here we develop a novel, fully-programmable RISC-V-based system-on-chip
(FeNN-DMA), tailored to simulating SNNs on modern UltraScale+ FPGAs. We show
that FeNN-DMA has comparable resource usage and energy requirements to
state-of-the-art fixed-function SNN accelerators, yet it is capable of
simulating much larger and more complex models. Using this functionality, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Spiking Heidelberg
Digits and Neuromorphic MNIST tasks.

### [307] [Trust Region-Based Bayesian Optimisation to Discover Diverse Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00750)
*Kokila Kasuni Perera,Frank Neumann,Aneta Neumann*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of trust region-based Bayesian optimisation (BO) for diversity optimisation in high-dimensional black-box problems, proposing novel methods and showing their effectiveness against baseline algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues in Bayesian optimisation when dealing with high-dimensional problems and explore diversity optimisation using trust regions.

Method: The paper introduces divTuRBO1, an extension of TuRBO1, for maintaining diversity thresholds and suggests sequential and interleaving approaches to combine divTuRBO1 runs.

Result: Proposed methods are experimentally tested on benchmark functions ranging from 2 to 20 dimensions, showing better performance than the baseline method, ROBOT, especially in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: Trust region-based BO methods, particularly the introduced approaches, are effective for scalable and diverse optimisation in high-dimensional black-box problems with limited evaluation budgets.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a surrogate-based optimisation technique that
efficiently solves expensive black-box functions with small evaluation budgets.
Recent studies consider trust regions to improve the scalability of BO
approaches when the problem space scales to more dimensions. Motivated by this
research, we explore the effectiveness of trust region-based BO algorithms for
diversity optimisation in different dimensional black box problems. We propose
diversity optimisation approaches extending TuRBO1, which is the first BO
method that uses a trust region-based approach for scalability. We extend
TuRBO1 as divTuRBO1, which finds an optimal solution while maintaining a given
distance threshold relative to a reference solution set. We propose two
approaches to find diverse solutions for black-box functions by combining
divTuRBO1 runs in a sequential and an interleaving fashion. We conduct
experimental investigations on the proposed algorithms and compare their
performance with that of the baseline method, ROBOT (rank-ordered Bayesian
optimisation with trust regions). We evaluate proposed algorithms on benchmark
functions with dimensions 2 to 20. Experimental investigations demonstrate that
the proposed methods perform well, particularly in larger dimensions, even with
a limited evaluation budget.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores inventory management for perishable goods under uncertainties like erratic demand, unreliable supplies, and variable shelf life. It compares two optimization strategies: global parameter tuning and a hyper-heuristic approach driven by metaheuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of managing perishable inventory confronted with uncertainties in supply, demand, and shelf life.

Method: The study utilizes a discrete-event simulation to compare uniform global optimization policies versus a hyper-heuristic approach leveraging Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization.

Result: Simulation results from 12 instances show that hyper-heuristic frameworks consistently perform better, with Genetic Algorithms particularly excelling in identifying optimal policies.

Conclusion: Item-level policy construction using hyper-heuristics significantly outperforms global strategies, validating the computational effort involved.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of managing perishable inventory under
multiple sources of uncertainty, including stochastic demand, unreliable
supplier fulfillment, and probabilistic product shelf life. We develop a
discrete-event simulation environment to compare two optimization strategies
for this multi-item, multi-supplier problem. The first strategy optimizes
uniform classic policies (e.g., Constant Order and Base Stock) by tuning their
parameters globally, complemented by a direct search to select the best-fitting
suppliers for the integrated problem. The second approach is a hyper-heuristic
approach, driven by metaheuristics such as a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This framework constructs a composite policy
by automating the selection of the heuristic type, its parameters, and the
sourcing suppliers on an item-by-item basis. Computational results from twelve
distinct instances demonstrate that the hyper-heuristic framework consistently
identifies superior policies, with GA and EGA exhibiting the best overall
performance. Our primary contribution is verifying that this item-level policy
construction yields significant performance gains over simpler global policies,
thereby justifying the associated computational cost.

*Balázs Mészáros,James C. Knight,Danyal Akarca,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuron position learning algorithm for spiking neural networks, where communication delays are influenced by spatial distances, leading to self-organized network topologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To incorporate biological aspects like space-time coupling into artificial neural networks to improve modeling and interpretability.

Method: A novel algorithm to learn neuron positions where synaptic delays are linked to Euclidean distances between neurons, with gradients derived for this learning.

Result: Networks organized into small-world topologies showed functional specialization aligning with spatial clustering without explicit enforcement of structure.

Conclusion: The approach introduces biologically-inspired spatial and temporal coupling, enhancing the interpretability and efficiency of artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Biological neural networks exist in physical space where distance determines
communication delays: a fundamental space-time coupling absent in most
artificial neural networks. While recent work has separately explored spatial
embeddings and learnable synaptic delays in spiking neural networks, we unify
these approaches through a novel neuron position learning algorithm where
delays relate to the Euclidean distances between neurons. We derive gradients
with respect to neuron positions and demonstrate that this
biologically-motivated constraint acts as an inductive bias: networks trained
on temporal classification tasks spontaneously self-organize into local,
small-world topologies with modular structure emerging under distance-dependent
connection costs. Remarkably, we observe unprompted functional specialization
aligned with spatial clustering without explictly enforcing it. These findings
lay the groundwork for networks in which space and time are intrinsically
coupled, offering new avenues for mechanistic interpretability, biologically
inspired modelling, and efficient implementations.

### [311] [Equality Saturation Guided by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00403)
*Wentao Peng,Ruyi Ji,Yingfei Xiong*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with correctness in formal rewrite systems. "LGuess" is introduced, using e-graphs as an intermediate layer to enhance accuracy in generating rewrite chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of LLM-generated rewrite chains and improve correctness within formal systems by better leveraging LLM capabilities.

Method: The authors integrate e-graphs as a layer between LLMs and rewrite systems, where LLMs propose high-level checkpoints and e-graphs generate the detailed rewrite paths. A probabilistic model derived from the LLM helps extract effective checkpoints.

Result: The prototype implementation of LGuess showed superior performance in factorizing multivariable polynomials compared to direct queries to LLMs or standard equality saturation.

Conclusion: LGuess offers a promising method to improve reliability in formal rewrite systems by combining LLM guidance with e-graph technology, addressing existing challenges in correctness.

Abstract: One critical issue with large language models (LLMs) is their inability to
guarantee correctness. Although this problem can be addressed by applying LLMs
to formal rewrite systems, current LLMs are still far from adequate to generate
sound rewrite chains. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes LLM-guided
equality saturation, dubbed LGuess, by incorporating e-graphs as an
intermediate layer between LLMs and rewrite systems. LGuess queries LLMs only
for high-level rewrite checkpoints and uses e-graphs to supply low-level
rewrite chains between these checkpoints. The key technical challenge in this
procedure lies in effectively extracting a suitable checkpoint from a saturated
e-graph, which LGuess addresses by learning a probabilistic model from the LLM.
The model predicts probable checkpoints while remaining simple enough for
effective extraction. We implement a prototype of LGuess and evaluate it on the
problem of factorizing multivariable polynomials. The results demonstrate a
significant advantage of LGuess compared to both straightforward equality
saturation and the approach that queries the LLM directly for the rewrite
chain.

### [312] [\texttt{ReMind}: Understanding Deductive Code Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00488)
*Jun Gao,Yun Peng,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deductive code reasoning with LLMs and proposes a novel multi-agent framework called ReMind to improve reasoning abilities, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with deductive code reasoning, hindering their ability to reason through program execution. Understanding and addressing the causes of this limitation is crucial for improvement.

Method: The paper introduces ReMind, a framework composed of three agents: Mutator (generates code variations), Executor (traces variable states), and Inspector (detects reasoning flaws to bridge gaps). It ensures coordinated collaboration among agents for refinement.

Result: ReMind displays superior performance in deductive code reasoning tasks, achieving better results in zero-shot generalization and overcoming challenges on benchmarks with multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: ReMind significantly enhances deductive code reasoning abilities in LLMs by systematically identifying and addressing reasoning limitations, thus improving code-related tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
code-related tasks. Despite their advancement, empirical evidence reveals that
they still struggle with \emph{deductive code reasoning}, the ability to reason
about the program execution process. While prior studies have recognized this
limitation, the underlying causes remain largely underexplored. In this paper,
we begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key
challenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between
generation and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources,
and (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these
challenges, we propose \texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of
\texttt{Mutator}, \texttt{Executor}, and \texttt{Inspector}. The
\texttt{Mutator} generates code variants to mitigate bias towards code sources,
the \texttt{Executor} traces variable states step-by-step to expose
inconsistency, and the \texttt{Inspector} identifies problematic reasoning
steps and provides control-flow refinement to bridge the intrinsic reasoning
gap. Through their coordinated collaboration, \texttt{ReMind} systematically
identifies and refines reasoning flaws, achieving outstanding performance and
enabling robust zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate the superior advantages of
\texttt{ReMind} compared to baseline approaches in deductive code reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ComPilot, an approach using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in a feedback loop with compilers for loop nest code optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code optimization for complex loop nests on modern hardware remains challenging.

Method: ComPilot employs off-the-shelf LLMs in a closed-loop interaction with compilers, where the LLM proposes transformations and iteratively refines them based on compiler feedback.

Result: Using the PolyBench benchmarks, ComPilot achieved significant speedups (2.66x single run, 3.54x best-of-5 runs) and surpassed the Pluto optimizer in many cases.

Conclusion: General-purpose LLMs, grounded by compiler feedback, can effectively guide code optimization, suggesting new avenues in agentic AI research for optimization tasks.

Abstract: Automatic code optimization remains a difficult challenge, particularly for
complex loop nests on modern hardware. This paper investigates a novel approach
to code optimization where Large Language Models (LLMs) guide the process
through a closed-loop interaction with a compiler. We present ComPilot, an
experimental framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs, without any
task-specific fine-tuning, as interactive optimization agents. ComPilot
establishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given
loop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting
back legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this
concrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our
extensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the
effectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean
speedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original
code. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the
state-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases.
This experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively
guide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening
promising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper presents an improved embedding of miniKanren into Haskell, addressing inefficiencies and reducing boilerplate in relational programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle inefficiencies and inelegance in prior functional conversions for relational programming using miniKanren, especially concerning performance and usability.

Method: The authors propose a typed, tagless-final embedding of miniKanren into Haskell, enhancing code structure and utility while maintaining performance benefits.

Result: The new embedding reduces boilerplate, avoids the need for determinism annotations and implicit generator threading, and preserves earlier speedups with potential enhancements.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed embedding in improving the usability and performance of relational programming in Haskell, suggesting broader applicability.

Abstract: Relational programming enables program synthesis through a verifier-to-solver
approach. An earlier paper introduced a functional conversion that mitigated
some of the inherent performance overhead. However, the conversion was
inelegant: it was oblivious to types, demanded determinism annotations, and
implicit generator threading. In this paper, we address these issues by
providing a typed tagless-final embedding of miniKanren into Haskell. This
improvement significantly reduces boilerplate while preserving, and sometimes
enhancing, earlier speedups.

TL;DR: Cobble is a programming language designed for quantum computational linear algebra, addressing challenges in matrix arithmetic for quantum algorithms and offering significant performance improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and optimize the development of quantum algorithms for computational linear algebra, addressing inefficiencies in matrix handling and circuit design.

Method: The authors introduce Cobble, which uses high-level notation to express quantum matrix representations and automates compilation to quantum circuits with optimization techniques.

Result: Cobble achieves 2.6x to 25.4x speedups over existing circuit optimizers in benchmark tests across applications such as simulation, regression, and search.

Conclusion: Cobble advances quantum programming by enabling efficient circuit designs for computational linear algebra, making quantum hardware applications more accessible and practical.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for computational linear algebra promise up to exponential
speedups for applications such as simulation and regression, making them prime
candidates for hardware realization. But these algorithms execute in a model
that cannot efficiently store matrices in memory like a classical algorithm
does, instead requiring developers to implement complex expressions for matrix
arithmetic in terms of correct and efficient quantum circuits. Among the
challenges for the developer is navigating a cost model in which conventional
optimizations for linear algebra, such as subexpression reuse, can be
inapplicable or unprofitable.
  In this work, we present Cobble, a language for programming with quantum
computational linear algebra. Cobble enables developers to express and
manipulate the quantum representations of matrices, known as block encodings,
using high-level notation that automatically compiles to correct quantum
circuits. Cobble features analyses that estimate leading factors in time and
space usage of programs, as well as optimizations that reduce overhead and
generate efficient circuits using leading techniques such as the quantum
singular value transformation. We evaluate Cobble on benchmark kernels for
simulation, regression, search, and other applications, showing 2.6x-25.4x
speedups not achieved by existing circuit optimizers on these benchmarks.

TL;DR: STRIDER enhances zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in unseen 3D environments by optimizing action decisions using spatial constraints and dynamic feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of agents failing to robustly navigate in unseen 3D environments with natural language instructions due to insufficient structured decision-making and feedback integration.

Method: The paper introduces STRIDER, which optimizes decision spaces with two key components: a Structured Waypoint Generator for spatial structure constraints and a Task-Alignment Regulator for behavior adjustments based on task progress.

Result: Experiments show that STRIDER significantly improves the Success Rate in zero-shot VLN-CE tasks from 29% to 35%, outperforming SOTA approaches by a relative gain of 20.7%.

Conclusion: STRIDER demonstrates the value of incorporating spatially constrained decision-making and feedback-guided execution, advancing navigation fidelity in zero-shot VLN-CE tasks.

Abstract: The Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments
(VLN-CE) task requires agents to navigate previously unseen 3D environments
using natural language instructions, without any scene-specific training. A
critical challenge in this setting lies in ensuring agents' actions align with
both spatial structure and task intent over long-horizon execution. Existing
methods often fail to achieve robust navigation due to a lack of structured
decision-making and insufficient integration of feedback from previous actions.
To address these challenges, we propose STRIDER (Instruction-Aligned Structural
Decision Space Optimization), a novel framework that systematically optimizes
the agent's decision space by integrating spatial layout priors and dynamic
task feedback. Our approach introduces two key innovations: 1) a Structured
Waypoint Generator that constrains the action space through spatial structure,
and 2) a Task-Alignment Regulator that adjusts behavior based on task progress,
ensuring semantic alignment throughout navigation. Extensive experiments on the
R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that STRIDER significantly outperforms
strong SOTA across key metrics; in particular, it improves Success Rate (SR)
from 29% to 35%, a relative gain of 20.7%. Such results highlight the
importance of spatially constrained decision-making and feedback-guided
execution in improving navigation fidelity for zero-shot VLN-CE.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiBo, a system to control humanoid agents using off-the-shelf Vision-Language Models, reducing the need for extensive datasets. The method involves translating high-level instructions into commands and performing human-like actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid agents face challenges in handling diverse, flexible interactions in open environments. Current solutions, like collecting large datasets, are expensive, making alternative approaches necessary.

Method: BiBo consists of two components: (1) an embodied instruction compiler for translating high-level instructions into low-level commands; (2) a diffusion-based motion executor for generating human-like motions that adjust to environmental feedback.

Result: BiBo achieves a 90.2% task success rate for interaction in open environments and improves text-guided motion execution precision by 16.3% compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed BiBo system effectively leverages existing Vision-Language Models to enhance humanoid agent control, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to data-intensive methods.

Abstract: Humanoid agents often struggle to handle flexible and diverse interactions in
open environments. A common solution is to collect massive datasets to train a
highly capable model, but this approach can be prohibitively expensive. In this
paper, we explore an alternative solution: empowering off-the-shelf
Vision-Language Models (VLMs, such as GPT-4) to control humanoid agents,
thereby leveraging their strong open-world generalization to mitigate the need
for extensive data collection. To this end, we present \textbf{BiBo}
(\textbf{B}uilding humano\textbf{I}d agent \textbf{B}y \textbf{O}ff-the-shelf
VLMs). It consists of two key components: (1) an \textbf{embodied instruction
compiler}, which enables the VLM to perceive the environment and precisely
translate high-level user instructions (e.g., {\small\itshape ``have a rest''})
into low-level primitive commands with control parameters (e.g.,
{\small\itshape ``sit casually, location: (1, 2), facing: 90$^\circ$''}); and
(2) a diffusion-based \textbf{motion executor}, which generates human-like
motions from these commands, while dynamically adapting to physical feedback
from the environment. In this way, BiBo is capable of handling not only basic
interactions but also diverse and complex motions. Experiments demonstrate that
BiBo achieves an interaction task success rate of 90.2\% in open environments,
and improves the precision of text-guided motion execution by 16.3\% over prior
methods. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Alpamayo-R1 (AR1), an advanced vision-language-action model for autonomous driving, focusing on reasoning and planning in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems struggle with safety-critical situations due to sparse supervision and limited causal understanding.

Method: The paper integrates a Chain of Causation dataset, a modular VLA architecture blending vision-language reasoning with trajectory planning, and multi-stage supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: AR1 achieves better planning accuracy, reasoning quality, and reduced error rates in simulations and real-world tests, scaling effectively up to 7B parameters.

Conclusion: AR1 improves reasoning and control for Level 4 autonomous driving, with real-time urban testing and plans to release models and datasets.

Abstract: End-to-end architectures trained via imitation learning have advanced
autonomous driving by scaling model size and data, yet performance remains
brittle in safety-critical long-tail scenarios where supervision is sparse and
causal understanding is limited. To address this, we introduce Alpamayo-R1
(AR1), a vision-language-action model (VLA) that integrates Chain of Causation
reasoning with trajectory planning to enhance decision-making in complex
driving scenarios. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) the Chain
of Causation (CoC) dataset, built through a hybrid auto-labeling and
human-in-the-loop pipeline producing decision-grounded, causally linked
reasoning traces aligned with driving behaviors; (2) a modular VLA architecture
combining Cosmos-Reason, a Vision-Language Model pre-trained for Physical AI
applications, with a diffusion-based trajectory decoder that generates
dynamically feasible plans in real time; (3) a multi-stage training strategy
using supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning and reinforcement learning
(RL) to optimize reasoning quality via large reasoning model feedback and
enforce reasoning-action consistency. Evaluation shows AR1 achieves up to a 12%
improvement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a
trajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in off-road rate and 25%
reduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training
improves reasoning quality by 45% as measured by a large reasoning model critic
and reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B
parameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm
real-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By
bridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a
practical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving. We plan to release AR1
models and a subset of the CoC in a future update.

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic control systems often fail to adapt efficiently in dynamic settings like smart cities and precision farming, leading to inefficiencies and operational failures.

Method: The framework uses a Digital Twin to simulate and optimize robot motions and control parameters based on real-time environmental changes, then automatically updates the robot's operation code accordingly.

Result: The approach achieves rapid and reliable adaptations in robotic systems without requiring manual intervention, enhancing their efficiency and autonomy.

Conclusion: The integration of Digital Twin technology in robotics offers a scalable solution for improving autonomy and adaptability in smart, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Robotic systems have become integral to smart environments, enabling
applications ranging from urban surveillance and automated agriculture to
industrial automation. However, their effective operation in dynamic settings -
such as smart cities and precision farming - is challenged by continuously
evolving topographies and environmental conditions. Traditional control systems
often struggle to adapt quickly, leading to inefficiencies or operational
failures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for
autonomous and dynamic reconfiguration of robotic controllers using Digital
Twin technology. Our approach leverages a virtual replica of the robot's
operational environment to simulate and optimize movement trajectories in
response to real-world changes. By recalculating paths and control parameters
in the Digital Twin and deploying the updated code to the physical robot, our
method ensures rapid and reliable adaptation without manual intervention. This
work advances the integration of Digital Twins in robotics, offering a scalable
solution for enhancing autonomy in smart, dynamic environments.

*Yanbing Mao,Yihao Cai,Lui Sha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel Real-DRL framework integrates a DRL agent, a safety-focused physics model, and a mechanism for interaction to ensure safety and high performance in real autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety challenges in autonomous systems, especially in safety-critical applications, by bridging gaps between simulations and real-world implementation.

Method: The Real-DRL framework comprises three components: DRL-Student (a deep reinforcement learning agent for dual learning modes), PHY-Teacher (a physics-based safety framework and real-time backup), and Trigger (managing their interactions).

Result: Experiments with real and simulated systems, including a quadruped robot and a cart-pole model, validated the effectiveness and safety guarantees of the Real-DRL framework.

Conclusion: Real-DRL achieves assured safety while learning, automatic hierarchical performance improvement, and balanced learning experiences, making it a promising approach for safe and high-performing autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Real-DRL framework for safety-critical autonomous
systems, enabling runtime learning of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent
to develop safe and high-performance action policies in real plants (i.e., real
physical systems to be controlled), while prioritizing safety! The Real-DRL
consists of three interactive components: a DRL-Student, a PHY-Teacher, and a
Trigger. The DRL-Student is a DRL agent that innovates in the dual
self-learning and teaching-to-learn paradigm and the real-time safety-informed
batch sampling. On the other hand, PHY-Teacher is a physics-model-based design
of action policies that focuses solely on safety-critical functions.
PHY-Teacher is novel in its real-time patch for two key missions: i) fostering
the teaching-to-learn paradigm for DRL-Student and ii) backing up the safety of
real plants. The Trigger manages the interaction between the DRL-Student and
the PHY-Teacher. Powered by the three interactive components, the Real-DRL can
effectively address safety challenges that arise from the unknown unknowns and
the Sim2Real gap. Additionally, Real-DRL notably features i) assured safety,
ii) automatic hierarchy learning (i.e., safety-first learning and then
high-performance learning), and iii) safety-informed batch sampling to address
the learning experience imbalance caused by corner cases. Experiments with a
real quadruped robot, a quadruped robot in NVIDIA Isaac Gym, and a cart-pole
system, along with comparisons and ablation studies, demonstrate the Real-DRL's
effectiveness and unique features.

### [322] [End-to-End Dexterous Arm-Hand VLA Policies via Shared Autonomy: VR Teleoperation Augmented by Autonomous Hand VLA Policy for Efficient Data Collection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00139)
*Yu Cui,Yujian Zhang,Lina Tao,Yang Li,Xinyu Yi,Zhibin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Shared Autonomy framework to improve dexterous robotic manipulation using human-robot collaboration and a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-like dexterous manipulation is a significant challenge for robots, and current data collection methods face limitations due to high cognitive load and unnatural motions.

Method: The study proposes shared control between human operators and autonomous policies. VR teleoperation allows human operators to guide robot arm movements, while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy controls fine-tuned hand movements, using tactile and visual feedback. The collected demonstrations are used to train a VLA policy supported by an Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module for better movement coordination.

Result: The proposed framework reduces manpower while enabling the creation of high-quality data. It achieves a 90% success rate in dexterous manipulation tasks across various objects, including unseen ones.

Conclusion: The Shared Autonomy framework and enhanced VLA model prove effective in addressing challenges of dexterous robotic manipulation and enable ongoing policy improvements.

Abstract: Achieving human-like dexterous manipulation remains a major challenge for
general-purpose robots. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show
potential in learning skills from demonstrations, their scalability is limited
by scarce high-quality training data. Existing data collection methods face
inherent constraints: manual teleoperation overloads human operators, while
automated planning often produces unnatural motions. We propose a Shared
Autonomy framework that divides control between macro and micro motions. A
human operator guides the robot's arm pose through intuitive VR teleoperation,
while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy handles fine-grained hand control using
real-time tactile and visual feedback. This division significantly reduces
cognitive load and enables efficient collection of high-quality coordinated
arm-hand demonstrations. Using this data, we train an end-to-end VLA policy
enhanced with our novel Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module, which captures
both distinct and shared representations of macro and micro movements for more
natural coordination. Our Corrective Teleoperation system enables continuous
policy improvement through human-in-the-loop failure recovery. Experiments
demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality data with minimal
manpower and achieves a 90% success rate across diverse objects, including
unseen instances. Comprehensive evaluations validate the system's effectiveness
in developing dexterous manipulation capabilities.

### [323] [EgoMI: Learning Active Vision and Whole-Body Manipulation from Egocentric Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00153)
*Justin Yu,Yide Shentu,Di Wu,Pieter Abbeel,Ken Goldberg,Philipp Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes EgoMI, a framework for imitation learning from egocentric human data to improve robot skill acquisition, focusing on coordinated hand-eye movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human head and hand movements during manipulation create challenges for robots due to dynamic viewpoints and distribution shifts that affect policy performance.

Method: The framework synchronizes end-effector and head trajectories while introducing a memory-augmented policy to handle historical observations.

Result: Policies incorporating head-motion modeling show enhanced performance over baselines, demonstrating effective bridging of human-robot embodiment gaps.

Conclusion: The EgoMI framework facilitates robust imitation learning for semi-humanoid robots by leveraging coordinated human head and hand movements.

Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations offers a promising approach for
robot skill acquisition, but egocentric human data introduces fundamental
challenges due to the embodiment gap. During manipulation, humans actively
coordinate head and hand movements, continuously reposition their viewpoint and
use pre-action visual fixation search strategies to locate relevant objects.
These behaviors create dynamic, task-driven head motions that static robot
sensing systems cannot replicate, leading to a significant distribution shift
that degrades policy performance. We present EgoMI (Egocentric Manipulation
Interface), a framework that captures synchronized end-effector and active head
trajectories during manipulation tasks, resulting in data that can be
retargeted to compatible semi-humanoid robot embodiments. To handle rapid and
wide-spanning head viewpoint changes, we introduce a memory-augmented policy
that selectively incorporates historical observations. We evaluate our approach
on a bimanual robot equipped with an actuated camera head and find that
policies with explicit head-motion modeling consistently outperform baseline
methods. Results suggest that coordinated hand-eye learning with EgoMI
effectively bridges the human-robot embodiment gap for robust imitation
learning on semi-humanoid embodiments. Project page:

### [324] [Reducing Robotic Upper-Limb Assessment Time While Maintaining Precision: A Time Series Foundation Model Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00193)
*Faranak Akbarifar,Nooshin Maghsoodi,Sean P Dukelow,Stephen Scott,Parvin Mousavi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study evaluates time-series models to reduce the trial count in Kinarm VGR assessments for stroke motor impairments while maintaining precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kinarm robot's VGR assessments require a high number of trials (40-64), leading to excessive time and fatigue burdens, especially for impaired stroke patients.

Method: Speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control participants were analyzed. A subset of 8-16 trials was recorded, and models like ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos generated synthetic trials. Kinematic features were recomputed, and outcomes were measured using ICC(2,1).

Result: Chronos model restored ICC >= 0.90 using only 8 recorded trials plus synthetic forecasts. MOMENT showed moderate improvements, while ARIMA showed minimal enhancement. Reliability was preserved across cohorts and protocols.

Conclusion: The forecasting approach, particularly using the Chronos model, effectively reduces trial number and duration while maintaining the reliability of kinematic parameters for assessing stroke-related motor impairments.

Abstract: Purpose: Visually Guided Reaching (VGR) on the Kinarm robot yields sensitive
kinematic biomarkers but requires 40-64 reaches, imposing time and fatigue
burdens. We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace
unrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the
reliability of standard Kinarm parameters.
  Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control
participants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the
first 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models,
fine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We
recomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time,
posture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and
compared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).
  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only
8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded
reaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA
improvements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials
replaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability.
  Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR
assessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5
minutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This
forecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for
assessing motor impairments following stroke.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that proprioceptively-tailored robotic training improves hand function and neural processing in stroke survivors, specifically benefiting those with proprioceptive deficits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether personalized robotic rehabilitation training can enhance hand function and neural processing in chronic stroke survivors, especially for those with proprioceptive impairments.

Method: The study conducted a randomized controlled trial with 46 chronic stroke survivors using a robotic finger exoskeleton for tailored proprioceptive training. Two approaches were tested: Propriopixel Training (enhancing proprioceptive processing via gamified movements) and Virtual Assistance Training (reducing robotic aid to promote self-reliance). Participants attended nine 2-hour sessions.

Result: Participants with proprioceptive deficits showed significant improvements in hand function from Propriopixel training, with moderate improvement from Virtual Assistance. EEG biomarkers confirmed enhanced neural proprioceptive processing.

Conclusion: Proprioceptively-tailored training improves hand function and proprioceptive processing, offering a promising method for precision neurorehabilitation targeting chronic stroke survivors with proprioceptive deficits.

Abstract: Precision rehabilitation aims to tailor movement training to improve
outcomes. We tested whether proprioceptively-tailored robotic training improves
hand function and neural processing in stroke survivors. Using a robotic finger
exoskeleton, we tested two proprioceptively-tailored approaches: Propriopixel
Training, which uses robot-facilitated, gamified movements to enhance
proprioceptive processing, and Virtual Assistance Training, which reduces
robotic aid to increase reliance on self-generated feedback. In a randomized
controlled trial, forty-six chronic stroke survivors completed nine 2-hour
sessions of Standard, Propriopixel or Virtual training. Among participants with
proprioceptive deficits, Propriopixel ((Box and Block Test: 7 +/- 4.2, p=0.002)
and Virtual Assistance (4.5 +/- 4.4 , p=0.068) yielded greater gains in hand
function (Standard: 0.8 +/- 2.3 blocks). Proprioceptive gains correlated with
improvements in hand function. Tailored training enhanced neural sensitivity to
proprioceptive cues, evidenced by a novel EEG biomarker, the proprioceptive
Contingent Negative Variation. These findings support proprioceptively-tailored
training as a pathway to precision neurorehabilitation.

### [326] [FGO MythBusters: Explaining how Kalman Filter variants achieve the same performance as FGO in navigation applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00306)
*Baoshan Song,Ruijie Xu,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical connection between Sliding Window-Factor Graph Optimization (SW-FGO) and Kalman filter variants, proposing a recursive FGO framework to unify them under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the theoretical relationship between SW-FGO and Kalman filter variants (KFV), which has remained unclear despite SW-FGO's advantages over EKF in navigation research.

Method: The authors identified conditions to link SW-FGO with KFV methods and proposed a Recursive FGO (Re-FGO) framework that aligns SW-FGO with EKF, IEKF, REKF, and RIEKF under explicit assumptions (e.g., Gaussian noise, Markov assumption, one-state window).

Result: Under specific conditions, Re-FGO regenerates KFV methods while SW-FGO demonstrates improvements in handling nonlinear and non-Gaussian situations at predictable computational costs.

Conclusion: This study establishes a theoretical link between SW-FGO and KFV, highlights SW-FGO's advantages in numerical estimation and compatibility with deep learning methods, and provides open source code and data for further exploration.

Abstract: Sliding window-factor graph optimization (SW-FGO) has gained more and more
attention in navigation research due to its robust approximation to
non-Gaussian noises and nonlinearity of measuring models. There are lots of
works focusing on its application performance compared to extended Kalman
filter (EKF) but there is still a myth at the theoretical relationship between
the SW-FGO and EKF. In this paper, we find the necessarily fair condition to
connect SW-FGO and Kalman filter variants (KFV) (e.g., EKF, iterative EKF
(IEKF), robust EKF (REKF) and robust iterative EKF (RIEKF)). Based on the
conditions, we propose a recursive FGO (Re-FGO) framework to represent KFV
under SW-FGO formulation. Under explicit conditions (Markov assumption,
Gaussian noise with L2 loss, and a one-state window), Re-FGO regenerates
exactly to EKF/IEKF/REKF/RIEKF, while SW-FGO shows measurable benefits in
nonlinear, non-Gaussian regimes at a predictable compute cost. Finally, after
clarifying the connection between them, we highlight the unique advantages of
SW-FGO in practical phases, especially on numerical estimation and deep
learning integration. The code and data used in this work is open sourced at

*Lingpeng Chen,Jiakun Tang,Apple Pui-Yi Chui,Ziyang Hong,Junfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of 3D reconstruction in degraded underwater environments using a new fusion method called SonarSweep, combining sonar and visual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality methods (vision or sonar) struggle in underwater environments due to visibility issues and low resolution, necessitating better multi-modal approaches.

Method: The proposed method, SonarSweep, integrates sonar and visual data using an adapted plane sweep algorithm for effective cross-modal fusion.

Result: SonarSweep consistently enables dense and accurate depth maps, outperforming existing techniques, particularly in environments with high turbidity.

Conclusion: SonarSweep successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods, proving effective for underwater 3D reconstruction, and contributes novel tools and data to the research community.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in visually-degraded underwater environments
remains a formidable challenge. Single-modality approaches are insufficient:
vision-based methods fail due to poor visibility and geometric constraints,
while sonar is crippled by inherent elevation ambiguity and low resolution.
Consequently, prior fusion technique relies on heuristics and flawed geometric
assumptions, leading to significant artifacts and an inability to model complex
scenes. In this paper, we introduce SonarSweep, a novel, end-to-end deep
learning framework that overcomes these limitations by adapting the principled
plane sweep algorithm for cross-modal fusion between sonar and visual data.
Extensive experiments in both high-fidelity simulation and real-world
environments demonstrate that SonarSweep consistently generates dense and
accurate depth maps, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across challenging conditions, particularly in high turbidity. To foster
further research, we will publicly release our code and a novel dataset
featuring synchronized stereo-camera and sonar data, the first of its kind.

*John A. Christian,Michael R. Walker II,Wyatt Bridgman,Michael J. Sparapany*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new class of coning correction algorithms using Runge-Kutta integration routines for improving navigation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation systems require accurate gyroscope integration, which demands effective coning compensation algorithms due to sensor rotation during integration.

Method: A novel coning correction algorithm based on Runge-Kutta integration routines is proposed, with a procedure for generating higher-order versions.

Result: The simple case of the algorithm aligns with popular existing coning methods, showcasing its validity and potential for scalability.

Conclusion: The research provides an innovative method for coning compensation, enhancing the precision of gyroscope integration in navigation systems.

Abstract: The integration of gyroscope measurements is an essential task for most
navigation systems. Modern vehicles typically use strapdown systems, such that
gyro integration requires coning compensation to account for the sensor's
rotation during the integration. Many coning compensation algorithms have been
developed and a few are reviewed. This work introduces a new class of coning
correction algorithm built directly from the classical Runge-Kutta integration
routines. A simple case is shown to collapse to one of the most popular coning
algorithms and a clear procedure for generating higher-order algorithms is
presented.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study develops and tests a bucket drum for lunar regolith excavation using MoonBot, achieving promising energy-efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable sustainable access to the Moon by efficiently excavating lunar regolith as part of Lunar In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) efforts.

Method: Developed a 3D-printed bucket drum prototype, tested efficiency through sandbox experiments for continuous and batch excavation using the modular MoonBot system.

Result: Efficient excavation rates were achieved: 777.54 kg/h (continuous) with 0.022 Wh/kg energy consumption, and 172.02 kg/h (batch) with 0.86 Wh/kg energy consumption. The tool weighs 4.8 kg and has a volume of 14.06 L.

Conclusion: The prototype showcased successful implementation of excavation, compatibility with MoonBot modular robots, and potential for enhanced efficiency with future sensor and autonomous system integration.

Abstract: In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is one of the key technologies for
enabling sustainable access to the Moon. The ability to excavate lunar regolith
is the first step in making lunar resources accessible and usable. This work
presents the development of a bucket drum for the modular robotic system
MoonBot, as part of the Japanese Moonshot program. A 3D-printed prototype made
of PLA was manufactured to evaluate its efficiency through a series of sandbox
tests. The resulting tool weighs 4.8 kg and has a volume of 14.06 L. It is
capable of continuous excavation at a rate of 777.54 kg/h with a normalized
energy consumption of 0.022 Wh/kg. In batch operation, the excavation rate is
172.02 kg/h with a normalized energy consumption of 0.86 Wh per kilogram of
excavated material. The obtained results demonstrate the successful
implementation of the concept. A key advantage of the developed tool is its
compatibility with the modular MoonBot robotic platform, which enables flexible

*Suraj Kumar,Andy Ruina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel bipedal robot balance control framework that utilizes descriptive low-dimensional state models only for balance, enabling efficient human-like movement and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bipedal balance is challenging due to its complex nature, and existing approaches restrict robots to simplified low-dimensional models, leading to inefficient walking patterns.

Method: The proposed method uses a descriptive low-dimensional model to maintain balance while allowing the remaining degrees of freedom to naturally evolve in high-dimensional space.

Result: The framework results in human-like walking gaits and enhanced robustness in bipedal robot balance control.

Conclusion: This approach overcomes limitations of traditional methods by achieving both efficiency and robustness in bipedal movement without enforcing restrictive models.

Abstract: Bipedal balance is challenging due to its multi-phase, hybrid nature and
high-dimensional state space. Traditional balance control approaches for
bipedal robots rely on low-dimensional models for locomotion planning and
reactive control, constraining the full robot to behave like these simplified
models. This involves tracking preset reference paths for the Center of Mass
and upper body obtained through low-dimensional models, often resulting in
inefficient walking patterns with bent knees. However, we observe that bipedal
balance is inherently low-dimensional and can be effectively described with
simple state and action descriptors in a low-dimensional state space. This
allows the robot's motion to evolve freely in its high-dimensional state space,
only constraining its projection in the low-dimensional state space. In this
work, we propose a novel control approach that avoids prescribing a
low-dimensional model to the full model. Instead, our control framework uses a
descriptive model with the minimum degrees of freedom necessary to maintain
balance, allowing the remaining degrees of freedom to evolve freely in the
high-dimensional space. This results in an efficient human-like walking gait
and improved robustness.

TL;DR: The paper presents a soft robotics gripper with origami-based modules for improved grasping capabilities without complex sensing or control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing soft robotic grippers struggle with bulky actuators, complicated control strategies, and require advanced sensors for stable grasping.

Method: The gripper uses passively deformable origami modules in each finger driven by a simple 1-DoF actuator mechanism to achieve shape adaptability and stable force output without active sensing.

Result: It achieves stable grasping and demonstrates simultaneous multi-object manipulation, significantly enhancing efficiency compared to single-object grasping.

Conclusion: Origami-based compliant structures offer a scalable solution for adaptive, efficient, and stable multi-object manipulation in various applications.

Abstract: Soft robotics gripper have shown great promise in handling fragile and
geometrically complex objects. However, most existing solutions rely on bulky
actuators, complex control strategies, or advanced tactile sensing to achieve
stable and reliable grasping performance. In this work, we present a
multi-finger hybrid gripper featuring passively deformable origami modules that
generate constant force and torque output. Each finger composed of parallel
origami modules is driven by a 1-DoF actuator mechanism, enabling passive shape
adaptability and stable grasping force without active sensing or feedback
control. More importantly, we demonstrate an interesting capability in
simultaneous multi-object grasping, which allows stacked objects of varied
shape and size to be picked, transported and placed independently at different
states, significantly improving manipulation efficiency compared to
single-object grasping. These results highlight the potential of origami-based
compliant structures as scalable modules for adaptive, stable and efficient
multi-object manipulation in domestic and industrial pick-and-place scenarios.

*Dianye Huang,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The D3P algorithm introduces a dual-branch diffusion policy integrating Deep Koopman Operators to improve robotic manipulation tasks, enhancing temporal dependencies and visual representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based generative models in imitation learning struggle with capturing strong temporal dependencies and often over-rely on proprioceptive cues, leading to failures in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposes D3P, a dual-branch architecture that divides roles: the visual branch focuses on encoding task progression, while the fused branch integrates visual and proprioceptive inputs. Deep Koopman Operator enhances visual temporal dynamics, and test-time confidence guides task retries.

Result: D3P showed a 14.6% improvement over state-of-the-art methods in simulated RLBench tasks and a 15.0% improvement in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The incorporation of a dual-branch policy and Deep Koopman Operators significantly improves reliability, recovery strategies, and overall performance in robotic manipulation. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Integrating generative models with action chunking has shown significant
promise in imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, the existing
diffusion-based paradigm often struggles to capture strong temporal
dependencies across multiple steps, particularly when incorporating
proprioceptive input. This limitation can lead to task failures, where the
policy overfits to proprioceptive cues at the expense of capturing the visually
derived features of the task. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Deep
Koopman-boosted Dual-branch Diffusion Policy (D3P) algorithm. D3P introduces a
dual-branch architecture to decouple the roles of different sensory modality
combinations. The visual branch encodes the visual observations to indicate
task progression, while the fused branch integrates both visual and
proprioceptive inputs for precise manipulation. Within this architecture, when
the robot fails to accomplish intermediate goals, such as grasping a drawer
handle, the policy can dynamically switch to execute action chunks generated by
the visual branch, allowing recovery to previously observed states and
facilitating retrial of the task. To further enhance visual representation
learning, we incorporate a Deep Koopman Operator module that captures
structured temporal dynamics from visual inputs. During inference, we use the
test-time loss of the generative model as a confidence signal to guide the
aggregation of the temporally overlapping predicted action chunks, thereby
enhancing the reliability of policy execution. In simulation experiments across
six RLBench tabletop tasks, D3P outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion
policy by an average of 14.6\%. On three real-world robotic manipulation tasks,
it achieves a 15.0\% improvement. Code: https://github.com/dianyeHuang/D3P.

*Hyungtae Lim,Daebeom Kim,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Mapcher, a novel MSS framework leveraging map-to-map registration for inter-session alignment, improving performance for heterogeneous LiDAR sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing MSS methods relying on loop closure detection, particularly for heterogeneous LiDAR sensors with differences in density and field of view.

Method: Developing Multi-Mapcher for initial inter-session alignment using large-scale map-to-map registration and 3D point cloud algorithms, followed by robust pose graph optimization.

Result: Achieved substantially better MSS performance and faster processing than state-of-the-art approaches across various LiDAR sensors.

Conclusion: Proposed framework demonstrates feasibility and superiority in MSS applications with code freely available.

Abstract: As various 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been
introduced to the market, research on multi-session simultaneous localization
and mapping (MSS) using heterogeneous LiDAR sensors has been actively
conducted. Existing MSS methods mostly rely on loop closure detection for
inter-session alignment; however, the performance of loop closure detection can
be potentially degraded owing to the differences in the density and field of
view (FoV) of the sensors used in different sessions. In this study, we
challenge the existing paradigm that relies heavily on loop detection modules
and propose a novel MSS framework, called Multi-Mapcher, that employs
large-scale map-to-map registration to perform inter-session initial alignment,
which is commonly assumed to be infeasible, by leveraging outlier-robust 3D
point cloud registration. Next, after finding inter-session loops by radius
search based on the assumption that the inter-session initial alignment is
sufficiently precise, anchor node-based robust pose graph optimization is
employed to build a consistent global map. As demonstrated in our experiments,
our approach shows substantially better MSS performance for various LiDAR
sensors used to capture the sessions and is faster than state-of-the-art
approaches. Our code is available at

Motivation: The study aims to overcome key challenges in underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage: limited sensing, communication, global localization, and handling environmental uncertainty.

Method: It introduces a framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate human-interpretable semantic tokens for navigation and a fuzzy inference system to produce control commands. Semantic communication ensures effective coordination between robots.

Result: The proposed framework enables robust navigation and efficient cooperative coverage in simulated reef environments, allowing improved adaptability and efficiency under GPS-denied, map-free conditions.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between semantic cognition and distributed control in underwater environments, demonstrating practical and effective solutions for cooperative multi-robot exploration.

Abstract: Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to
partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and
the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper
presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language
Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw
multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact,
human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored
regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy
inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens
into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation
without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple
robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local
context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while
avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like
environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed
framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with
improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic
cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free
conditions.

*Stella Kombo,Masih Haseli,Skylar Wei,Joel W. Burdick*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear predictive model using a modified Hankel-DMD for denoising and forecasting agent motions under partial and noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting the motions of nearby agents in real-time despite dealing with partial and noisy data.

Method: The paper utilizes a modified sliding-window Hankel-DMD combined with singular-value hard thresholding and Cadzow projection to denoise data and construct a lifted linear predictor for multi-step forecasts.

Result: The method proved effective in simulation and tests with Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise, as well as a crane testbed, achieving stable denoising and short-horizon predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is reliable for real-time variance-aware denoising and motion forecasting, making it suitable for integration into autonomous systems' control frameworks.

Abstract: Autonomous systems often must predict the motions of nearby agents from
partial and noisy data. This paper asks and answers the question: "can we
learn, in real-time, a nonlinear predictive model of another agent's motions?"
Our online framework denoises and forecasts such dynamics using a modified
sliding-window Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Hankel-DMD). Partial noisy
measurements are embedded into a Hankel matrix, while an associated Page matrix
enables singular-value hard thresholding (SVHT) to estimate the effective rank.
A Cadzow projection enforces structured low-rank consistency, yielding a
denoised trajectory and local noise variance estimates. From this
representation, a time-varying Hankel-DMD lifted linear predictor is
constructed for multi-step forecasts. The residual analysis provides
variance-tracking signals that can support downstream estimators and risk-aware
planning. We validate the approach in simulation under Gaussian and
heavy-tailed noise, and experimentally on a dynamic crane testbed. Results show
that the method achieves stable variance-aware denoising and short-horizon
prediction suitable for integration into real-time control frameworks.

*William Suliman,Ekaterina Chaikovskaia,Egor Davydenko,Roman Gorbachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a heuristic-based bipedal locomotion framework that enhances precision, robustness, and energy efficiency, removing the need for complex model-based components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of model-based step planning approaches to achieve robust bipedal locomotion in dynamic environments.

Method: A heuristic step-planning strategy coupled with a Raibert-type controller for modulating foot placement based on torso velocity errors.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated superior accuracy (up to 80%), improved robustness (over 50%), and enhanced energy efficiency compared to model-based methods.

Conclusion: Complex model-based components may not be essential for stable bipedal walking; the heuristic framework achieves robust performance in unstructured environments.

Abstract: This work presents an extended framework for learning-based bipedal
locomotion that incorporates a heuristic step-planning strategy guided by
desired torso velocity tracking. The framework enables precise interaction
between a humanoid robot and its environment, supporting tasks such as crossing
gaps and accurately approaching target objects. Unlike approaches based on full
or simplified dynamics, the proposed method avoids complex step planners and
analytical models. Step planning is primarily driven by heuristic commands,
while a Raibert-type controller modulates the foot placement length based on
the error between desired and actual torso velocity. We compare our method with
a model-based step-planning approach -- the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) controller. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach attains
comparable or superior accuracy in maintaining target velocity (up to 80%),
significantly greater robustness on uneven terrain (over 50% improvement), and
improved energy efficiency. These results suggest that incorporating complex
analytical, model-based components into the training architecture may be
unnecessary for achieving stable and robust bipedal walking, even in
unstructured environments.

TL;DR: Maestro integrates vision-language models with modular robot capabilities, achieving superior zero-shot manipulation performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods aim to train end-to-end robotics models on large datasets, similar to VLMs. This paper seeks a different approach by leveraging VLMs to design generalist robotic policies.

Method: A VLM coding agent dynamically creates policies by composing specialized perception, planning, and control modules tailored to tasks and scenarios.

Result: Maestro significantly outperforms vision-language action models in zero-shot task performance while being extensible, adaptable, and editable for diverse robotic systems.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates an innovative way to build versatile and adaptable robot frameworks using VLM and modular components, offering both superior performance and flexibility.

Abstract: Today's best-explored routes towards generalist robots center on collecting
ever larger "observations-in actions-out" robotics datasets to train large
end-to-end models, copying a recipe that has worked for vision-language models
(VLMs). We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly
around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot
capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning,
and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these
modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's
architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many
manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool
repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot
performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily
extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments
such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world
experiences through local code edits.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fast-SmartWay eliminates panoramic views and waypoint predictors for zero-shot navigation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), combining RGB-D images and natural language for direct action prediction. It decreases latency and competes effectively with baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-and-Language Navigation systems suffer from limitations due to reliance on panoramic observations and two-stage pipelines, which hinder real-world applicability due to latency.

Method: Fast-SmartWay uses frontal RGB-D images and natural language to enable direct action prediction by MLLMs, enhanced by an Uncertainty-Aware Reasoning module with Disambiguation and Bidirectional Reasoning components.

Result: Fast-SmartWay significantly reduces latency per decision while achieving competitive or superior performance compared to panoramic-view navigation baselines in simulated and real-world robot environments.

Conclusion: Fast-SmartWay is effective and practical for real-world zero-shot embodied navigation, bypassing key limitations of prior approaches while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments
(VLN-CE) have leveraged multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve
zero-shot navigation. However, existing methods often rely on panoramic
observations and two-stage pipelines involving waypoint predictors, which
introduce significant latency and limit real-world applicability. In this work,
we propose Fast-SmartWay, an end-to-end zero-shot VLN-CE framework that
eliminates the need for panoramic views and waypoint predictors. Our approach
uses only three frontal RGB-D images combined with natural language
instructions, enabling MLLMs to directly predict actions. To enhance decision
robustness, we introduce an Uncertainty-Aware Reasoning module that integrates
(i) a Disambiguation Module for avoiding local optima, and (ii) a Future-Past
Bidirectional Reasoning mechanism for globally coherent planning. Experiments
on both simulated and real-robot environments demonstrate that our method
significantly reduces per-step latency while achieving competitive or superior
performance compared to panoramic-view baselines. These results demonstrate the
practicality and effectiveness of Fast-SmartWay for real-world zero-shot
embodied navigation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces URDF-Anything, an automatic framework to reconstruct articulated objects using multimodal large language models, achieving notable improvements in accuracy, generalization, and physical executability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic simulation training and embodied AI world model building require high-precision digital twins of articulated objects, which conventional methods fail to construct efficiently.

Method: The proposed framework employs a 3D multimodal large language model to perform autoregressive predictions on point-cloud and text multimodal input, jointly optimizing geometric segmentation and kinematic parameters through a specialized $[SEG]$ token mechanism.

Result: URDF-Anything showed significant improvements: 17% in geometric segmentation accuracy, 29% error reduction in kinematic parameter prediction, and 50% better performance in physical executability compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Using URDF-Anything greatly enhances the construction of digital twins for robotics, improving sim-to-real transfer and generalization to unseen objects.

Abstract: Constructing accurate digital twins of articulated objects is essential for
robotic simulation training and embodied AI world model building, yet
historically requires painstaking manual modeling or multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose \textbf{URDF-Anything}, an end-to-end automatic
reconstruction framework based on a 3D multimodal large language model (MLLM).
URDF-Anything utilizes an autoregressive prediction framework based on
point-cloud and text multimodal input to jointly optimize geometric
segmentation and kinematic parameter prediction. It implements a specialized
$[SEG]$ token mechanism that interacts directly with point cloud features,
enabling fine-grained part-level segmentation while maintaining consistency
with the kinematic parameter predictions. Experiments on both simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing approaches regarding geometric segmentation (mIoU 17\% improvement),
kinematic parameter prediction (average error reduction of 29\%), and physical
executability (surpassing baselines by 50\%). Notably, our method exhibits
excellent generalization ability, performing well even on objects outside the
training set. This work provides an efficient solution for constructing digital
twins for robotic simulation, significantly enhancing the sim-to-real transfer
capability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework combining perception and control design to achieve high-frequency, real-time target tracking in Robotic Ultrasound Systems (RUSS), overcoming latency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary challenge addressed is the end-to-end latency in Robotic Ultrasound Systems, hindering effective real-time tracking in dynamic and clinical environments.

Method: The paper proposes a Decoupled Dual-Stream Perception Network for robust 3D state estimation and a Single-Step Flow Policy for entire action sequence generation, enabling high-bandwidth closed-loop control.

Result: The system achieves closed-loop control over 60Hz, accurate 3D tracking with mean error under 6.5mm, robust re-acquisition, and validated performance in human in-vivo experiments.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant step forward for autonomous Robotic Ultrasound Systems by merging high-frequency tracking with large-scale positional adjustments in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Real-time tracking of dynamic targets amidst large-scale, high-frequency
disturbances remains a critical unsolved challenge in Robotic Ultrasound
Systems (RUSS), primarily due to the end-to-end latency of existing systems.
This paper argues that breaking this latency barrier requires a fundamental
shift towards the synergistic co-design of perception and control. We realize
it in a novel framework with two tightly-coupled contributions: (1) a Decoupled
Dual-Stream Perception Network that robustly estimates 3D translational state
from 2D images at high frequency, and (2) a Single-Step Flow Policy that
generates entire action sequences in one inference pass, bypassing the
iterative bottleneck of conventional policies. This synergy enables a
closed-loop control frequency exceeding 60Hz. On a dynamic phantom, our system
not only tracks complex 3D trajectories with a mean error below 6.5mm but also
demonstrates robust re-acquisition from over 170mm displacement. Furthermore,
it can track targets at speeds of 102mm/s, achieving a terminal error below
1.7mm. Moreover, in-vivo experiments on a human volunteer validate the
framework's effectiveness and robustness in a realistic clinical setting. Our
work presents a RUSS holistically architected to unify high-bandwidth tracking
with large-scale repositioning, a critical step towards robust autonomy in
dynamic clinical environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GauDP, a novel approach for scalable and perception-aware imitation learning in multi-agent systems, achieving improved performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of effective coordination in embodied multi-agent systems where agents must balance individual perspectives with global awareness.

Method: GauDP constructs a 3D Gaussian field from decentralized RGB observations, redistributing 3D Gaussian attributes dynamically to facilitate localized and global task-critical queries.

Result: GauDP outperforms existing image-based methods on the RoboFactory benchmark, advancing scalability and efficacy for multi-arm manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: GauDP effectively improves coordination and performance in multi-agent collaborative systems, achieving results comparable to point-cloud-based methods without requiring additional sensing modalities.

Abstract: Recently, effective coordination in embodied multi-agent systems has remained
a fundamental challenge, particularly in scenarios where agents must balance
individual perspectives with global environmental awareness. Existing
approaches often struggle to balance fine-grained local control with
comprehensive scene understanding, resulting in limited scalability and
compromised collaboration quality. In this paper, we present GauDP, a novel
Gaussian-image synergistic representation that facilitates scalable,
perception-aware imitation learning in multi-agent collaborative systems.
Specifically, GauDP constructs a globally consistent 3D Gaussian field from
decentralized RGB observations, then dynamically redistributes 3D Gaussian
attributes to each agent's local perspective. This enables all agents to
adaptively query task-critical features from the shared scene representation
while maintaining their individual viewpoints. This design facilitates both
fine-grained control and globally coherent behavior without requiring
additional sensing modalities (e.g., 3D point cloud). We evaluate GauDP on the
RoboFactory benchmark, which includes diverse multi-arm manipulation tasks. Our
method achieves superior performance over existing image-based methods and
approaches the effectiveness of point-cloud-driven methods, while maintaining
strong scalability as the number of agents increases.

TL;DR: The paper presents an optimization algorithm leveraging a tensorial parametric reduced order model (PROM) to address computational challenges in optimizing soft-bodied robots under nonlinear forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need to efficiently optimize soft-bodied robotic structures dealing with complex nonlinear forces, as existing simulations are computationally expensive.

Method: The method introduces a tensorial PROM-based optimization algorithm that integrates dimensionality reduction and analytical gradient solutions to solve nonlinear constrained optimization problems efficiently.

Result: The approach demonstrated enhanced computational efficiency and was successfully applied to the shape optimization of soft robotic swimmers subjected to nonlinear hydrodynamic forces.

Conclusion: This method reduces computational complexity while enabling efficient optimization of complex nonlinear systems, advancing the design and control of soft robotic systems.

Abstract: The efficient optimization of actuated soft structures, particularly under
complex nonlinear forces, remains a critical challenge in advancing robotics.
Simulations of nonlinear structures, such as soft-bodied robots modeled using
the finite element method (FEM), often demand substantial computational
resources, especially during optimization. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel optimization algorithm based on a tensorial parametric reduced
order model (PROM). Our algorithm leverages dimensionality reduction and
solution approximation techniques to facilitate efficient solving of nonlinear
constrained optimization problems. The well-structured tensorial approach
enables the use of analytical gradients within a specifically chosen reduced
order basis (ROB), significantly enhancing computational efficiency. To
showcase the performance of our method, we apply it to optimizing soft robotic
swimmer shapes. These actuated soft robots experience hydrodynamic forces,
subjecting them to both internal and external nonlinear forces, which are
incorporated into our optimization process using a data-free ROB for fast and
accurate computations. This approach not only reduces computational complexity
but also unlocks new opportunities to optimize complex nonlinear systems in
soft robotics, paving the way for more efficient design and control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPAR-H, a human-in-the-loop learning framework for UAV river navigation, leveraging statewise preferences to address distribution shifts and ensure safe adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in adapting simulation-trained UAVs for real-world river navigation, including distribution shifts and safety risks.

Method: The authors introduce SPAR-H, a hybrid learning method combining direct preference optimization and reward-based pathways using HITL rollouts.

Result: With minimal HITL rollouts, SPAR-H achieves superior episodic rewards, stability, and alignment with human preferences compared to other methods tested.

Conclusion: Statewise preferences in SPAR-H offer an effective and efficient path for adapting UAV policies to real-world river navigation tasks.

Abstract: Rivers are critical corridors for environmental monitoring and disaster
response, where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) guided by vision-driven
policies can provide fast, low-cost coverage. However, deployment exposes
simulation-trained policies with distribution shift and safety risks and
requires efficient adaptation from limited human interventions. We study
human-in-the-loop (HITL) learning with a conservative overseer who vetoes
unsafe or inefficient actions and provides statewise preferences by comparing
the agent's proposal with a corrective override. We introduce Statewise Hybrid
Preference Alignment for Robotics (SPAR-H), which fuses direct preference
optimization on policy logits with a reward-based pathway that trains an
immediate-reward estimator from the same preferences and updates the policy
using a trust-region surrogate. With five HITL rollouts collected from a fixed
novice policy, SPAR-H achieves the highest final episodic reward and the lowest
variance across initial conditions among tested methods. The learned reward
model aligns with human-preferred actions and elevates nearby non-intervened
choices, supporting stable propagation of improvements. We benchmark SPAR-H
against imitation learning (IL), direct preference variants, and evaluative
reinforcement learning (RL) in the HITL setting, and demonstrate real-world
feasibility of continual preference alignment for UAV river following. Overall,
dual statewise preferences empirically provide a practical route to
data-efficient online adaptation in riverine navigation.

TL;DR: SLAP enhances TAMP by leveraging RL to discover new options, reducing plan lengths by 50% and improving task success rates in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in TAMP due to reliance on manually-defined behaviors for long-horizon decision-making with sparse rewards.

Method: Integrate reinforcement learning to identify shortcuts in the abstract planning graph, enabling the discovery of novel, dynamic options beyond human-engineered ones.

Result: Experimentation in simulated robotic environments demonstrates shorter plans and higher generalization, outperforming planning and RL baselines.

Conclusion: Shortcut Learning for Abstract Planning (SLAP) significantly improves performance in long-horizon tasks through innovation and leveraging existing TAMP frameworks.

Abstract: Long-horizon decision-making with sparse rewards and continuous states and
actions remains a fundamental challenge in AI and robotics. Task and motion
planning (TAMP) is a model-based framework that addresses this challenge by
planning hierarchically with abstract actions (options). These options are
manually defined, limiting the agent to behaviors that we as human engineers
know how to program (pick, place, move). In this work, we propose Shortcut
Learning for Abstract Planning (SLAP), a method that leverages existing TAMP
options to automatically discover new ones. Our key idea is to use model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to learn shortcuts in the abstract planning graph
induced by the existing options in TAMP. Without any additional assumptions or
inputs, shortcut learning leads to shorter solutions than pure planning, and
higher task success rates than flat and hierarchical RL. Qualitatively, SLAP
discovers dynamic physical improvisations (e.g., slap, wiggle, wipe) that
differ significantly from the manually-defined ones. In experiments in four
simulated robotic environments, we show that SLAP solves and generalizes to a
wide range of tasks, reducing overall plan lengths by over 50% and consistently
outperforming planning and RL baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-effective proprioceptive method for soft robots, combining IMUs with bend sensors and using a Kalman filter for better shape estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve shape estimation of soft robots using accessible and cost-effective sensors while ensuring long-term reliability.

Method: IMUs and complementary bend sensors are combined to mitigate drift issues, with a Kalman filter used to fuse sensor data for improved tip orientation estimation.

Result: The method achieved a 56% reduction in error compared to IMU-only benchmarks with accurate and robust performance during diverse experimental conditions.

Conclusion: The approach provides reliable proprioception for soft robots, maintaining high accuracy and long-duration performance in various environments.

Abstract: This study presents an enhanced proprioceptive method for accurate shape
estimation of soft robots using only off-the-shelf sensors, ensuring
cost-effectiveness and easy applicability. By integrating inertial measurement
units (IMUs) with complementary bend sensors, IMU drift is mitigated, enabling
reliable long-term proprioception. A Kalman filter fuses segment tip
orientations from both sensors in a mutually compensatory manner, improving
shape estimation over single-sensor methods. A piecewise constant curvature
model estimates the tip location from the fused orientation data and
reconstructs the robot's deformation. Experiments under no loading, external
forces, and passive obstacle interactions during 45 minutes of continuous
operation showed a root mean square error of 16.96 mm (2.91% of total length),
a 56% reduction compared to IMU-only benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
our approach not only enables long-duration proprioception in soft robots but
also maintains high accuracy and robustness across these diverse conditions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-embodiment learning for robots, proposing a unified world model to handle diverse morphologies by abstracting embodiment-specific details. Experiments show promising results for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of enabling generalist robots to operate across diverse morphologies, overcoming obstacles like differences in action spaces and kinematics.

Method: They propose a unified state and action representation using 3D particle-based models and train a graph-based world model on diverse exploration data from both simulated robot hands and real human hands.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that including more training embodiments improves generalization, combining real and simulated data leads to better outcomes, and the models effectively control robots with various degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: World models provide an effective and promising approach for facilitating cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation in robots.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment learning seeks to build generalist robots that operate
across diverse morphologies, but differences in action spaces and kinematics
hinder data sharing and policy transfer. This raises a central question: Is
there any invariance that allows actions to transfer across embodiments? We
conjecture that environment dynamics are embodiment-invariant, and that world
models capturing these dynamics can provide a unified interface across
embodiments. To learn such a unified world model, the crucial step is to design
state and action representations that abstract away embodiment-specific details
while preserving control relevance. To this end, we represent different
embodiments (e.g., human hands and robot hands) as sets of 3D particles and
define actions as particle displacements, creating a shared representation for
heterogeneous data and control problems. A graph-based world model is then
trained on exploration data from diverse simulated robot hands and real human
hands, and integrated with model-based planning for deployment on novel
hardware. Experiments on rigid and deformable manipulation tasks reveal three
findings: (i) scaling to more training embodiments improves generalization to
unseen ones, (ii) co-training on both simulated and real data outperforms
training on either alone, and (iii) the learned models enable effective control
on robots with varied degrees of freedom. These results establish world models
as a promising interface for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper presents LiDAR-VGGT, a framework combining LiDAR and VGGT to reconstruct large-scale colored point clouds efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing large-scale colored point clouds is crucial in robotics for tasks like navigation and perception, but existing models suffer from calibration and scalability challenges.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine fusion method that combines LiDAR inertial odometry with VGGT through pre-fusion (to refine initialization) and post-fusion (to reduce scale distortions).

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms VGGT-based methods and LIVO baselines in generating dense, consistent point clouds.

Conclusion: LiDAR-VGGT effectively addresses calibration and scalability limits in existing methods, providing superior large-scale point cloud reconstruction, with plans to release an open-source toolkit.

Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale colored point clouds is an important task in
robotics, supporting perception, navigation, and scene understanding. Despite
advances in LiDAR inertial visual odometry (LIVO), its performance remains
highly sensitive to extrinsic calibration. Meanwhile, 3D vision foundation
models, such as VGGT, suffer from limited scalability in large environments and
inherently lack metric scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose
LiDAR-VGGT, a novel framework that tightly couples LiDAR inertial odometry with
the state-of-the-art VGGT model through a two-stage coarse- to-fine fusion
pipeline: First, a pre-fusion module with robust initialization refinement
efficiently estimates VGGT poses and point clouds with coarse metric scale
within each session. Then, a post-fusion module enhances cross-modal 3D
similarity transformation, using bounding-box-based regularization to reduce
scale distortions caused by inconsistent FOVs between LiDAR and camera sensors.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-VGGT
achieves dense, globally consistent colored point clouds and outperforms both
VGGT-based methods and LIVO baselines. The implementation of our proposed novel
color point cloud evaluation toolkit will be released as open source.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cardioscope in the form of a steerable balloon for intracardiac visualization and tool delivery, aiming to improve imaging and tool navigation during minimally invasive transcatheter procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and ultrasound have limitations, and there is a need for advanced imaging and navigation tools to replace open-heart surgery with safer transcatheter procedures.

Method: The study designed and tested a balloon-shaped cardioscope, capable of collapsing for vascular insertion and inflating within the heart. The balloon, through a single inflation input, can independently alter its diameter and bending angle for better field of view and precise tool control.

Result: A balloon-based cardioscope design was demonstrated for an aortic leaflet laceration task. Image-based closed-loop control was used to achieve stable orientation during tool handling.

Conclusion: The balloon technology presented can be optimized for various intracardiac tasks, potentially making minimally-invasive cardiac procedures safer and more effective.

Abstract: To move away from open-heart surgery towards safer transcatheter procedures,
there is a growing need for improved imaging techniques and robotic solutions
to enable simple, accurate tool navigation. Common imaging modalities, such as
fluoroscopy and ultrasound, have limitations that can be overcome using
cardioscopy, i.e., direct optical visualization inside the beating heart. We
present a cardioscope designed as a steerable balloon. As a balloon, it can be
collapsed to pass through the vasculature and subsequently inflated inside the
heart for visualization and tool delivery through an integrated working
channel. Through careful design of balloon wall thickness, a single input,
balloon inflation pressure, is used to independently control two outputs,
balloon diameter (corresponding to field of view diameter) and balloon bending
angle (enabling precise working channel positioning). This balloon technology
can be tuned to produce cardioscopes designed for a range of intracardiac
tasks. To illustrate this approach, a balloon design is presented for the
specific task of aortic leaflet laceration. Image-based closed-loop control of
bending angle is also demonstrated as a means of enabling stable orientation
control during tool insertion and removal.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to solve the Kidnapped Robot Problem (KRP) using a LiDAR scan and occupancy grid map for global relocalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of relocalizing a robot in a known map without a prior pose estimate during localization failure or SLAM initialization.

Method: A passive 2-D global relocalization framework achieved via multi-hypothesis scheme, batched multi-stage inference, RRT for sampling, SMAD for ranking hypotheses, and TAM for reliable pose evaluation.

Result: Experimental results show improved success rate and computational efficiency in global relocalization using the proposed framework on a resource-constrained mobile robot.

Conclusion: The framework successfully tackles the KRP, significantly enhancing mobile robot autonomy and reliability in real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Kidnapped Robot Problem (KRP), a core localization
challenge of relocalizing a robot in a known map without prior pose estimate
when localization loss or at SLAM initialization. For this purpose, a passive
2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose
efficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map
while the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of
mobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a
non-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched
multi-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and
efficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability
constraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse,
uniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing
the sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed
Scan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that
facilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates.
The SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. And the
Translation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for
reliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final
pose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field
metrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well
as non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments
on a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scan
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both
global relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ET-VLA, a new framework enhancing vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-robot collaboration, using synthetic data to bypass costly human demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art VLA models face challenges in multi-robot collaboration despite their successes in single-robot tasks. This research aims to address inefficiencies and high data collection costs for adapting these models to multi-robot environments.

Method: The authors propose Synthetic Continued Pretraining (SCP) using synthetic data for initial model adaptation to multi-robot embodiments, combined with Embodied Graph-of-Thought to structure sub-tasks and roles during execution.

Result: ET-VLA was validated on bimanual robots using three different embodiments, showing superior performance and achieving over 53.2% improvement compared to existing models like OpenVLA across six real-world tasks.

Conclusion: ET-VLA successfully improves VLA models for multi-robot tasks by reducing data collection costs and enhancing performance. The research will be open-sourced to accelerate further developments in robotic learning.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
learning, enabling training on large-scale, cross-embodiment data and
fine-tuning for specific robots. However, state-of-the-art autoregressive VLAs
struggle with multi-robot collaboration. We introduce embodiment transfer
learning, denoted as ET-VLA, a novel framework for efficient and effective
transfer of pre-trained VLAs to multi-robot. ET-VLA's core is Synthetic
Continued Pretraining (SCP), which uses synthetically generated data to warm up
the model for the new embodiment, bypassing the need for real human
demonstrations and reducing data collection costs. SCP enables the model to
learn correct actions and precise action token numbers. Following SCP, the
model is fine-tuned on target embodiment data. To further enhance the model
performance on multi-embodiment, we present the Embodied Graph-of-Thought
technique, a novel approach that formulates each sub-task as a node, that
allows the VLA model to distinguish the functionalities and roles of each
embodiment during task execution. Our work considers bimanual robots, a simple
version of multi-robot to verify our approaches. We validate the effectiveness
of our method on both simulation benchmarks and real robots covering three
different bimanual embodiments. In particular, our proposed ET-VLA \space can
outperform OpenVLA on six real-world tasks over 53.2%. We will open-source all
codes to support the community in advancing VLA models for robot learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical robotic systems lack sufficient accuracy, precision, and flexibility for refined procedures and tool exchange.

Method: The robotic system was evaluated with optical coherence tomography to measure tooltip accuracy and precision during automated cataract lens extraction using deep learning-based anatomical modeling.

Result: Tooltip positioning accuracy was achieved at 0.053±0.031 mm, validated through OCT-guided procedures, demonstrating high precision.

Conclusion: This innovative robotic system improves tooltip accuracy, tracking performance, and automated mechanisms, benefiting complex surgeries like cataract lens removal.

Abstract: Despite the extensive demonstration of robotic systems for both cataract and
vitreoretinal procedures, existing technologies or mechanisms still possess
insufficient accuracy, precision, and degrees of freedom for instrument
manipulation or potentially automated tool exchange during surgical procedures.
A new robotic system that focuses on improving tooltip accuracy, tracking
performance, and smooth instrument exchange mechanism is therefore designed and
manufactured. Its tooltip accuracy, precision, and mechanical capability of
maintaining small incision through remote center of motion were externally
evaluated using an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. Through robot
calibration and precise coordinate registration, the accuracy of tooltip
positioning was measured to be 0.053$\pm$0.031 mm, and the overall performance
was demonstrated on an OCT-guided automated cataract lens extraction procedure
with deep learning-based pre-operative anatomical modeling and real-time
supervision.

TL;DR: SATPlanner introduces a novel Large Language Model-driven approach for effective path planning in unknown environments for spherical tensegrity robots and demonstrates superior performance in simulation and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient and robust path planning for spherical tensegrity robots in unknown environments, proposing an improved approach to overcome the limitations of traditional grid-based path planners.

Method: The proposed solution, SATPlanner, integrates an Adaptive Observation Window mechanism inspired by "fast" and "slow" thinking paradigms, leveraging LLMs to enable semantic environment reasoning and efficient path planning.

Result: SATPlanner demonstrated 100% success in 1,000 simulation trials, reduced search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while maintaining near-optimal path lengths, and proved practical feasibility in physical spherical tensegrity robot tests.

Conclusion: SATPlanner effectively blends semantic reasoning enabled by LLMs with adaptive planning mechanisms to achieve optimal exploration and navigation strategies for spherical tensegrity robots in complex environments.

Abstract: Endowed with inherent dynamical properties that grant them remarkable
ruggedness and adaptability, spherical tensegrity robots stand as prototypical
examples of hybrid softrigid designs and excellent mobile platforms. However,
path planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant
challenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and
robust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a
geometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure
in complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome
these limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a
semantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots
(SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages
high-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable
planning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window
mechanism, inspired by the "fast" and "slow" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This
mechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for
rapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle
configurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the
environment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path
length (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate
SATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate,
outperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner
reduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving
comparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of
SATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.

*Yasamin Foroutani,Yasamin Mousavi-Motlagh,Aya Barzelay,Tsu-Chin Tsao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Iterative Learning Control (ILC) to improve the precision and safety of robotic surgeries like subretinal injections by addressing system misalignments and actuation inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic surgeries often face challenges like misalignments and inaccuracies during operations, requiring advanced control methods to improve efficacy and safety.

Method: The study employs ILC with joint commands refined iteratively based on Optical Coherence Tomography feedback, starting with the calibration of forward kinematics for accuracy.

Result: Tests on ex vivo pig eyes showed that the optimized trajectory via ILC improved tissue penetration and subretinal injection success rates compared to traditional straight insertion.

Conclusion: ILC proves effective in overcoming alignment challenges for robotic surgeries and can be extended to other precision tasks requiring controlled tool insertions.

Abstract: Achieving precise control of robotic tool paths is often challenged by
inherent system misalignments, unmodeled dynamics, and actuation inaccuracies.
This work introduces an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) strategy to enable
precise rotational insertion of a tool during robotic surgery, improving
penetration efficacy and safety compared to straight insertion tested in
subretinal injection. A 4 degree of freedom (DOF) robot manipulator is used,
where misalignment of the fourth joint complicates the simple application of
needle rotation, motivating an ILC approach that iteratively adjusts joint
commands based on positional feedback. The process begins with calibrating the
forward kinematics for the chosen surgical tool to achieve higher accuracy,
followed by successive ILC iterations guided by Optical Coherence Tomography
(OCT) volume scans to measure the error and refine control inputs. Experimental
results, tested on subretinal injection tasks on ex vivo pig eyes, show that
the optimized trajectory resulted in higher success rates in tissue penetration
and subretinal injection compared to straight insertion, demonstrating the
effectiveness of ILC in overcoming misalignment challenges. This approach
offers potential applications for other high precision robot tasks requiring
controlled insertions as well.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to create wearable robots by designing knitted fabrics that mimic origami, enhancing structural integrity, compliance, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots need to balance structural integrity for functionality and compliance for wearer comfort, which is challenging.

Method: The authors developed a method to translate origami designs into knit patterns using programmable stitches and materials, incorporating heat fusible yarn to improve structural functionality.

Result: They quantified folding moments, demonstrated enhanced folding directionality and rigidity, and successfully recreated complex origami designs as well as a wearable knitted robot.

Conclusion: Knitted origami combines reconfigurability, material programmability, and scalable manufacturing, offering a promising direction for wearable robotics.

Abstract: Soft robots employing compliant materials and deformable structures offer
great potential for wearable devices that are comfortable and safe for human
interaction. However, achieving both structural integrity and compliance for
comfort remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel
fabrication and design method that combines the advantages of origami
structures with the material programmability and wearability of knitted
fabrics. We introduce a general design method that translates origami patterns
into knit designs by programming both stitch and material patterns. The method
creates folds in preferred directions while suppressing unintended buckling and
bending by selectively incorporating heat fusible yarn to create rigid panels
around compliant creases. We experimentally quantify folding moments and show
that stitch patterning enhances folding directionality while the heat fusible
yarn (1) keeps geometry consistent by reducing edge curl and (2) prevents
out-of-plane deformations by stiffening panels. We demonstrate the framework
through the successful reproduction of complex origami tessellations, including
Miura-ori, Yoshimura, and Kresling patterns, and present a wearable knitted
Kaleidocycle robot capable of locomotion. The combination of structural
reconfigurability, material programmability, and potential for manufacturing
scalability highlights knitted origami as a promising platform for
next-generation wearable robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework using conditional diffusion models to enhance dexterous grasp generation by transferring high-quality grasps across objects within the same category.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and lack of task adaptability in analytical methods and the poor generalization of generative approaches for dexterous grasp generation.

Method: The framework uses a conditional diffusion model with object contact maps, dual mapping mechanisms, and cascaded diffusion processes to transfer grasp details efficiently and consistently.

Result: Demonstrated superior grasp quality, efficiency, and generalization performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances stability, adaptability, and efficiency in dexterous grasp generation across diverse tasks and objects.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp generation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring
both grasp stability and adaptability across diverse objects and tasks.
Analytical methods ensure stable grasps but are inefficient and lack task
adaptability, while generative approaches improve efficiency and task
integration but generalize poorly to unseen objects and tasks due to data
limitations. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based framework for dexterous
grasp generation, leveraging a conditional diffusion model to transfer
high-quality grasps from shape templates to novel objects within the same
category. Specifically, we reformulate the grasp transfer problem as the
generation of an object contact map, incorporating object shape similarity and
task specifications into the diffusion process. To handle complex shape
variations, we introduce a dual mapping mechanism, capturing intricate
geometric relationship between shape templates and novel objects. Beyond the
contact map, we derive two additional object-centric maps, the part map and
direction map, to encode finer contact details for more stable grasps. We then
develop a cascaded conditional diffusion model framework to jointly transfer
these three maps, ensuring their intra-consistency. Finally, we introduce a
robust grasp recovery mechanism, identifying reliable contact points and
optimizing grasp configurations efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method. Our approach effectively balances grasp
quality, generation efficiency, and generalization performance across various
tasks. Project homepage: https://cmtdiffusion.github.io/

Motivation: To address limitations in motion stability and control in high-speed spherical robot designs.

Method: A novel spherical robot structure incorporating a secondary pendulum and momentum wheel for improved control.

Result: Experiments show stable high-speed motion and enhanced obstacle-crossing capability and terrain robustness.

Conclusion: The design outperforms previous models in speed, stability, and robustness, showing promise for complex terrains.

Abstract: This paper designs a new spherical robot structure capable of supporting
high-speed motion at up to 10 m/s. Building upon a single-pendulum-driven

Practical experiments with the physical prototype have demonstrated that this

TL;DR: Kinematify framework automatically generates articulated object models from RGB images or text prompts, addressing topology and joint parameter estimation challenges for high-DoF objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand kinematic structures for robots to manipulate high-DoF objects effectively, overcoming scalability issues in traditional modeling methods.

Method: Utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for kinematic topology inference and optimization techniques for reasoning joint parameters.

Result: Evaluates on synthetic and real environments, showing enhanced accuracy in object registration and kinematic topology over prior approaches.

Conclusion: Kinematify improves scalability and physical simulation accuracy for constructing articulated object models, paving the way for broader applications in robotics.

Abstract: A deep understanding of kinematic structures and movable components is
essential for enabling robots to manipulate objects and model their own
articulated forms. Such understanding is captured through articulated objects,
which are essential for tasks such as physical simulation, motion planning, and
policy learning. However, creating these models, particularly for complex
systems like robots or objects with high degrees of freedom (DoF), remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on motion sequences or
strong assumptions from hand-curated datasets, which hinders scalability. In
this paper, we introduce Kinematify, an automated framework that synthesizes
articulated objects directly from arbitrary RGB images or text prompts. Our
method addresses two core challenges: (i) inferring kinematic topologies for
high-DoF objects and (ii) estimating joint parameters from static geometry. To
achieve this, we combine MCTS search for structural inference with
geometry-driven optimization for joint reasoning, producing physically
consistent and functionally valid descriptions. We evaluate Kinematify on
diverse inputs from both synthetic and real-world environments, demonstrating
improvements in registration and kinematic topology accuracy over prior work.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RobustVLA, an RL-based post-training method for Vision-Language-Action models, enhancing robustness to observation noise and action perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models show promise but fail in environments with disturbances like noise and perturbations, making robustness critical.

Method: The study proposes RobustVLA, incorporating Jacobian and smoothness regularizations, for stability against environmental uncertainties.

Result: RobustVLA significantly improves reliability and robustness compared to prior methods in diverse robotic settings.

Conclusion: Principled robustness-aware RL post-training is essential for enhancing the reliability of Vision-Language-Action models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as powerful
general-purpose policies for robotic manipulation, benefiting from large-scale
multi-modal pre-training. However, they often fail to generalize reliably in
out-of-distribution deployments, where unavoidable disturbances such as
observation noise, sensor errors, or actuation perturbations become prevalent.
While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training provides a
practical means to adapt pre-trained VLA models, existing methods mainly
emphasize reward maximization and overlook robustness to environmental
uncertainty. In this work, we introduce RobustVLA, a lightweight online RL
post-training method designed to explicitly enhance the resilience of VLA
models. Through a systematic robustness analysis, we identify two key
regularizations: Jacobian regularization, which mitigates sensitivity to
observation noise, and smoothness regularization, which stabilizes policies
under action perturbations. Extensive experiments across diverse robotic
environments demonstrate that RobustVLA significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in robustness and reliability. Our results highlight
the importance of principled robustness-aware RL post-training as a key step
toward improving the reliability and robustness of VLA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving models depend heavily on visual feature extraction networks trained with supervised labels, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: The authors propose using a comparative learning approach between visual feature networks and an EEG model, leveraging a collected cognitive dataset to integrate human driving cognition into autonomous driving models.

Result: Experimental results show that $E^{3}AD$ significantly improves planning performance over baseline models, validated in open and closed-loop tests. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of driving cognition and the comparative learning approach.

Conclusion: This work is pioneering in integrating human driving cognition into autonomous driving systems, representing a significant step toward brain-inspired autonomous driving and enhancing end-to-end planning performance.

Abstract: In recent years, vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a
new paradigm. However, popular end-to-end approaches typically rely on visual
feature extraction networks trained under label supervision. This limited
supervision framework restricts the generality and applicability of driving
models. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm termed $E^{3}AD$, which
advocates for comparative learning between visual feature extraction networks
and the general EEG large model, in order to learn latent human driving
cognition for enhancing end-to-end planning. In this work, we collected a
cognitive dataset for the mentioned contrastive learning process. Subsequently,
we investigated the methods and potential mechanisms for enhancing end-to-end
planning with human driving cognition, using popular driving models as
baselines on publicly available autonomous driving datasets. Both open-loop and
closed-loop tests are conducted for a comprehensive evaluation of planning
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the $E^{3}AD$ paradigm
significantly enhances the end-to-end planning performance of baseline models.
Ablation studies further validate the contribution of driving cognition and the
effectiveness of comparative learning process. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work to integrate human driving cognition for improving
end-to-end autonomous driving planning. It represents an initial attempt to
incorporate embodied cognitive data into end-to-end autonomous driving,
providing valuable insights for future brain-inspired autonomous driving
systems. Our code will be made available at Github

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a fully functional, plant-inspired, autonomous soft machine mimicking the Venus flytrap's fast snapping closure and reopening motion.

Method: The researchers designed a life-sized AVF using UV-curable thermo-responsive shape memory materials. Shape memory polymers enable the closing action at 38°C, while shape memory elastomer strips enable the reopening action at 45°C.

Result: The AVF successfully demonstrated the closing and reopening behaviors, showing sequential movements triggered by temperature changes in a natural range.

Conclusion: This study achieved the first bidirectional, thermo-responsive AVF, advancing the field of autonomous soft robotic systems inspired by biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite their often perceived static and slow nature, some plants can move
faster than the blink of an eye. The rapid snap closure motion of the Venus
flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) has long captivated the interest of researchers and
engineers alike, serving as a model for plant-inspired soft machines and
robots. The translation of the fast snapping closure has inspired the
development of various artificial Venus flytrap (AVF) systems. However,
translating both the closing and reopening motion of D. muscipula into an
autonomous plant inspired soft machine has yet to be achieved. In this study,
we present an AVF that autonomously closes and reopens, utilizing novel
thermo-responsive UV-curable shape memory materials for soft robotic systems.
The life-sized thermo-responsive AVF exhibits closing and reopening motions
triggered in a naturally occurring temperature range. The doubly curved trap
lobes, built from shape memory polymers, close at 38{\deg}C, while reopening
initiates around 45{\deg}C, employing shape memory elastomer strips as
antagonistic actuators to facilitate lobe reopening. This work represents the
first demonstration of thermo-responsive closing and reopening in an AVF with
programmed sequential motion in response to increasing temperature. This
approach marks the next step toward autonomously bidirectional moving soft

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots, inspired by earthworm motion, offer advantages in efficiency, adaptability, and use in confined spaces, yet they often rely on bulky electronic controls.

Method: The study introduces a modular system with plug-and-play bellow actuators and modified Pneumatic Logic Gates to achieve autonomous peristaltic locomotion without electronics.

Result: The designed system enables effective, electronics-free peristaltic propagation with minimal deviation validated by actuator characterization and locomotion performance tests.

Conclusion: The proof-of-concept demonstrates potential for soft robots in hazardous environments, introducing efficient and untethered operation with reduced system complexity.

Abstract: Soft robotic systems have gained widespread attention due to their inherent
flexibility, adaptability, and safety, making them well-suited for varied
applications. Among bioinspired designs, earthworm locomotion has been
extensively studied for its efficient peristaltic motion, enabling movement in
confined and unstructured environments. Existing earthworm-inspired robots
primarily utilize pneumatic actuation due to its high force-to-weight ratio and
ease of implementation. However, these systems often rely on bulky,
power-intensive electronic control units, limiting their practicality. In this
work, we present an electronics-free, earthworm-inspired pneumatic robot
utilizing a modified Pneumatic Logic Gate (PLG) design. By integrating
preconfigured PLG units with bellow actuators, we achieved a plug-and-play
style modular system capable of peristaltic locomotion without external
electronic components. The proposed design reduces system complexity while
maintaining efficient actuation. We characterize the bellow actuators under
different operating conditions and evaluate the robots locomotion performance.
Our findings demonstrate that the modified PLG-based control system effectively
generates peristaltic wave propagation, achieving autonomous motion with
minimal deviation. This study serves as a proof of concept for the development
of electronics-free, peristaltic soft robots. The proposed system has potential
for applications in hazardous environments, where untethered, adaptable
locomotion is critical. Future work will focus on further optimizing the robot
design and exploring untethered operation using onboard compressed air sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the motion mechanics of the Venus flytrap and utilize its principles to design artificial actuators.

Method: The researchers examined the Venus flytrap's geometrical characteristics and replicated these in 3D-printed bistable actuator models.

Result: The 3D-printed actuators demonstrated bistability and rapid snapping, mimicking the Venus flytrap's behavior.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed soft actuators inspired by the Venus flytrap, paving the way for applications such as fast grippers.

Abstract: The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) does not only serve as the textbook
model for a carnivorous plant, but also has long intrigued both botanists and
engineers with its rapidly closing leaf trap. The trap closure is triggered by
two consecutive touches of a potential prey, after which the lobes rapidly
switch from their concave open-state to their convex close-state and catch the
prey within 100-500 ms after being triggered. This transformation from concave
to convex is initiated by changes in turgor pressure and the release of stored
elastic energy from prestresses in the concave state, which accelerate this
movement, leading to inversion of the lobes bi-axial curvature. Possessing two
low-energy states, the leaves can be characterized as bistable systems. With
our research, we seek to deepen the understanding of Venus flytrap motion
mechanics and apply its principles to the design of an artificial bistable lobe
actuator. We identified geometrical characteristics, such as dimensional ratios
and the thickness gradient in the lobe, and transferred these to two 3D-printed
bistable actuator models. One actuator parallels the simulated geometry of a
Venus flytrap leaf, the other is a lobe model designed with CAD. Both models
display concave-convex bi-stability and snap close. These demonstrators are the
first step in the development of an artificial Venus flytrap that mimics the
mechanical behavior of the biological model and can be used as a soft fast
gripper.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in accurate lateral velocity estimation for automated parking, presenting a new model that improves accuracy using minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise localization is vital for automated parking in tight spaces, yet lateral velocity estimation lacks dedicated sensors in consumer-grade vehicles.

Method: Analyzed real-world parking data, identified deviations in existing zero-slip models, and proposed a simplified lateral velocity model relying on two parameters.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated improved lateral velocity estimation accuracy during parking scenarios.

Conclusion: The model enhances automated parking performance in consumer vehicles, ensuring better lateral dynamics representation with simple implementation.

Abstract: Automated parking requires accurate localization for quick and precise
maneuvering in tight spaces. While the longitudinal velocity can be measured
using wheel encoders, the estimation of the lateral velocity remains a key
challenge due to the absence of dedicated sensors in consumer-grade vehicles.
Existing approaches often rely on simplified vehicle models, such as the
zero-slip model, which assumes no lateral velocity at the rear axle. It is well
established that this assumption does not hold during low-speed driving and
researchers thus introduce additional heuristics to account for differences. In
this work, we analyze real-world data from parking scenarios and identify a
systematic deviation from the zero-slip assumption. We provide explanations for
the observed effects and then propose a lateral velocity model that better
captures the lateral dynamics of the vehicle during parking. The model improves
estimation accuracy, while relying on only two parameters, making it

*Kun Hu,Menggang Li,Zhiwen Jin,Chaoquan Tang,Eryi Hu,Gongbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops CM-LIUW-Odometry, a multimodal SLAM framework designed for GPS-denied underground coal mines, achieving improved robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM applications face significant obstacles in GPS-denied coal mines such as LiDAR ineffectiveness, terrain challenges reducing odometer accuracy, and long tunnels causing limited sensing. The paper aims to overcome these issues.

Method: The authors propose CM-LIUW-Odometry using Iterated Error-State Kalman Filter, combining LiDAR-inertial odometry, UWB positioning constraints, wheel odometer integration, nonholonomic constraints, vehicle compensation, and adaptive motion mode switching.

Result: Results demonstrate that CM-LIUW-Odometry outperforms existing SLAM methods in underground coal mines, with superior accuracy and robustness validated through real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical SLAM solution for challenging GPS-denied environments and is open-sourced to support further robotics research.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in large-scale, complex, and
GPS-denied underground coal mine environments presents significant challenges.
Sensors must contend with abnormal operating conditions: GPS unavailability
impedes scene reconstruction and absolute geographic referencing, uneven or
slippery terrain degrades wheel odometer accuracy, and long, feature-poor
tunnels reduce LiDAR effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose
CoalMine-LiDAR-IMU-UWB-Wheel-Odometry (CM-LIUW-Odometry), a multimodal SLAM
framework based on the Iterated Error-State Kalman Filter (IESKF). First,
LiDAR-inertial odometry is tightly fused with UWB absolute positioning
constraints to align the SLAM system with a global coordinate. Next, wheel
odometer is integrated through tight coupling, enhanced by nonholonomic
constraints (NHC) and vehicle lever arm compensation, to address performance
degradation in areas beyond UWB measurement range. Finally, an adaptive motion
mode switching mechanism dynamically adjusts the robot's motion mode based on
UWB measurement range and environmental degradation levels. Experimental
results validate that our method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in
real-world underground coal mine scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art
approaches. We open source our code of this work on Github to benefit the
robotics community.

*Landson Guo,Andres M. Diaz Aguilar,William Talbot,Turcan Tuna,Marco Hutter,Cesar Cadena*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaRLi-V, a fusion pipeline combining RADAR, LiDAR, and camera data for precise 3D velocity estimation, enabling better robot interaction in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in robotic interaction with dynamic agents such as humans and objects, ensuring accurate 3D point-wise velocity estimation for improved navigation and manipulation.

Method: The method includes using RADAR's velocity cube for radial velocities, optical flow for tangential velocities, and LiDAR for range measurements, integrated through a closed-form solution into the CaRLi-V fusion pipeline.

Result: The CaRLi-V system demonstrated low velocity estimation errors in experiments, validated against ground truth using a custom dataset.

Conclusion: CaRLi-V provides accurate point-wise velocity estimation and is open-sourced as a ROS2 package, showing its practical potential for improving robotic applications in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Accurate point-wise velocity estimation in 3D is crucial for robot
interaction with non-rigid, dynamic agents, such as humans, enabling robust
performance in path planning, collision avoidance, and object manipulation in
dynamic environments. To this end, this paper proposes a novel RADAR, LiDAR,
and camera fusion pipeline for point-wise 3D velocity estimation named CaRLi-V.
This pipeline leverages raw RADAR measurements to create a novel RADAR
representation, the velocity cube, which densely represents radial velocities
within the RADAR's field-of-view. By combining the velocity cube for radial
velocity extraction, optical flow for tangential velocity estimation, and LiDAR
for point-wise range measurements through a closed-form solution, our approach
can produce 3D velocity estimates for a dense array of points. Developed as an
open-source ROS2 package, CaRLi-V has been field-tested against a custom
dataset and proven to produce low velocity error metrics relative to ground
truth, enabling point-wise velocity estimation for robotic applications.

*Paolo Rabino,Gabriele Tiboni,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FoldPath, a neural field-based method for generating continuous robotic motion trajectories without requiring sensitive post-processing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust algorithms to automate high-precision robotic tasks in manufacturing processes, addressing the weaknesses of heuristics or learning-based methods requiring brittle post-processing.

Method: FoldPath uses a continuous function neural field approach to learn robot motions, eliminating discrete waypoints and post-processing while ensuring smooth paths.

Result: FoldPath achieves superior predictive performance and generalization capabilities, even with limited expert samples in industrial settings, validated in realistic simulations.

Conclusion: FoldPath significantly enhances OCMG tasks by introducing end-to-end trajectory generations, improving practicality and performance in industrial robotics applications.

Abstract: Object-Centric Motion Generation (OCMG) is instrumental in advancing
automated manufacturing processes, particularly in domains requiring
high-precision expert robotic motions, such as spray painting and welding. To
realize effective automation, robust algorithms are essential for generating
extended, object-aware trajectories across intricate 3D geometries. However,
contemporary OCMG techniques are either based on ad-hoc heuristics or employ
learning-based pipelines that are still reliant on sensitive post-processing
steps to generate executable paths. We introduce FoldPath, a novel, end-to-end,
neural field based method for OCMG. Unlike prior deep learning approaches that
predict discrete sequences of end-effector waypoints, FoldPath learns the robot
motion as a continuous function, thus implicitly encoding smooth output paths.
This paradigm shift eliminates the need for brittle post-processing steps that
concatenate and order the predicted discrete waypoints. Particularly, our
approach demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to recently
proposed learning-based methods, and attains generalization capabilities even
in real industrial settings, where only a limited amount of 70 expert samples
are provided. We validate FoldPath through comprehensive experiments in a
realistic simulation environment and introduce new, rigorous metrics designed
to comprehensively evaluate long-horizon robotic paths, thus advancing the OCMG
task towards practical maturity.

Abstract: This paper presents the software architecture and deployment strategy behind
the MoonBot platform: a modular space robotic system composed of heterogeneous
components distributed across multiple computers, networks and ultimately
celestial bodies. We introduce a principled approach to distributed,
heterogeneous modularity, extending modular robotics beyond physical
reconfiguration to software, communication and orchestration. We detail the
architecture of our system that integrates component-based design, a
data-oriented communication model using ROS2 and Zenoh, and a deployment
orchestrator capable of managing complex multi-module assemblies. These
abstractions enable dynamic reconfiguration, decentralized control, and
seamless collaboration between numerous operators and modules. At the heart of
this system lies our open-source Motion Stack software, validated by months of
field deployment with self-assembling robots, inter-robot cooperation, and
remote operation. Our architecture tackles the significant hurdles of modular
robotics by significantly reducing integration and maintenance overhead, while
remaining scalable and robust. Although tested with space in mind, we propose
generalizable patterns for designing robotic systems that must scale across
time, hardware, teams and operational environments.

*Sarthak Mishra,Rishabh Dev Yadav,Avirup Das,Saksham Gupta,Wei Pan,Spandan Roy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces AERMANI-VLM, a framework using pretrained vision-language models for safe aerial manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make aerial robotic manipulation tasks feasible and safe by integrating vision-language models while addressing their inherent limitations.

Method: The framework decouples high-level reasoning from low-level control, uses a structured prompt to encode instructions, task context, and safety constraints, and selects predefined flight-safe skills.

Result: AERMANI-VLM successfully demonstrated generalization and robustness in multi-step tasks across unseen commands, objects, and environments.

Conclusion: By separating symbolic reasoning from physical actions, AERMANI-VLM enhances safety and reliability for aerial manipulation operations without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The rapid progress of vision--language models (VLMs) has sparked growing
interest in robotic control, where natural language can express the operation
goals while visual feedback links perception to action. However, directly
deploying VLM-driven policies on aerial manipulators remains unsafe and
unreliable since the generated actions are often inconsistent,
hallucination-prone, and dynamically infeasible for flight. In this work, we
present AERMANI-VLM, the first framework to adapt pretrained VLMs for aerial
manipulation by separating high-level reasoning from low-level control, without
any task-specific fine-tuning. Our framework encodes natural language
instructions, task context, and safety constraints into a structured prompt
that guides the model to generate a step-by-step reasoning trace in natural
language. This reasoning output is used to select from a predefined library of
discrete, flight-safe skills, ensuring interpretable and temporally consistent
execution. By decoupling symbolic reasoning from physical action, AERMANI-VLM
mitigates hallucinated commands and prevents unsafe behavior, enabling robust
task completion. We validate the framework in both simulation and hardware on
diverse multi-step pick-and-place tasks, demonstrating strong generalization to
previously unseen commands, objects, and environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MO-SeGMan is a framework for solving highly constrained rearrangement problems by minimizing replanning and robot travel distances while ensuring efficiency and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of planning object rearrangements in cluttered, highly constrained environments while optimizing solution quality and efficiency.

Method: The authors developed MO-SeGMan, incorporating Selective Guided Forward Search to tackle cluttered scenarios and a refinement method for adaptive subgoal selection to improve solution quality.

Result: Experiments showed that MO-SeGMan consistently outperforms baseline approaches by generating faster, high-quality solutions for benchmark rearrangement tasks.

Conclusion: MO-SeGMan is a robust and scalable solution for tackling complex rearrangement planning problems.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MO-SeGMan, a Multi-Objective Sequential and Guided
Manipulation planner for highly constrained rearrangement problems. MO-SeGMan
generates object placement sequences that minimize both replanning per object
and robot travel distance while preserving critical dependency structures with
a lazy evaluation method. To address highly cluttered, non-monotone scenarios,
we propose a Selective Guided Forward Search (SGFS) that efficiently relocates
only critical obstacles and to feasible relocation points. Furthermore, we
adopt a refinement method for adaptive subgoal selection to eliminate
unnecessary pick-and-place actions, thereby improving overall solution quality.
Extensive evaluations on nine benchmark rearrangement tasks demonstrate that
MO-SeGMan generates feasible motion plans in all cases, consistently achieving
faster solution times and superior solution quality compared to the baselines.
These results highlight the robustness and scalability of the proposed
framework for complex rearrangement planning problems.

*Wei Huang,Jiaxin Li,Zang Wan,Huijun Di,Wei Liang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GlocDiff, a diffusion-based navigation policy leveraging floor plans and RGB inputs for indoor target guidance, addressing challenges like modality gap and localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in indoor navigation such as integrating visual and spatial information and ensuring accurate localization in unseen environments.

Method: GlocDiff integrates global path planning from floor plans with local depth-aware features derived from RGB observations and enhances robustness with noise perturbation during training.

Result: Extensive experiments show that GlocDiff achieves superior navigation performance on the FloNa benchmark, effective obstacle avoidance, and precise direction prediction.

Conclusion: GlocDiff demonstrates promising results for indoor navigation, showing potential for practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Guiding an agent to a specific target in indoor environments based solely on
RGB inputs and a floor plan is a promising yet challenging problem. Although
existing methods have made significant progress, two challenges remain
unresolved. First, the modality gap between egocentric RGB observations and the
floor plan hinders the integration of visual and spatial information for both
local obstacle avoidance and global planning. Second, accurate localization is
critical for navigation performance, but remains challenging at deployment in
unseen environments due to the lack of explicit geometric alignment between RGB
inputs and floor plans. We propose a novel diffusion-based policy, denoted as
GlocDiff, which integrates global path planning from the floor plan with local
depth-aware features derived from RGB observations. The floor plan offers
explicit global guidance, while the depth features provide implicit geometric
cues, collectively enabling precise prediction of optimal navigation directions
and robust obstacle avoidance. Moreover, GlocDiff introduces noise perturbation
during training to enhance robustness against pose estimation errors, and we
find that combining this with a relatively stable VO module during inference
results in significantly improved navigation performance. Extensive experiments
on the FloNa benchmark demonstrate GlocDiff's efficiency and effectiveness in
achieving superior navigation performance, and the success of real-world
deployments also highlights its potential for widespread practical
applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phy-Tac, a human-inspired method for efficient and stable robotic grasping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often use excessive force during grasping, unlike humans who optimize force for stability. The authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: The approach integrates pose selection, tactile prediction using a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model, and force regulation through a latent-space LQR controller.

Result: The proposed Phy-Tac method showed better grasp stability and force efficiency compared to existing baselines, validated via experiments on robotic platforms.

Conclusion: The Phy-Tac method successfully improves robotic grasping efficiency and stability, aligning robotic behavior closer to human-like performance.

Abstract: Humans naturally grasp objects with minimal level required force for
stability, whereas robots often rely on rigid, over-squeezing control. To
narrow this gap, we propose a human-inspired physics-conditioned tactile method
(Phy-Tac) for force-optimal stable grasping (FOSG) that unifies pose selection,
tactile prediction, and force regulation. A physics-based pose selector first
identifies feasible contact regions with optimal force distribution based on
surface geometry. Then, a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model (Phy-LDM)
predicts the tactile imprint under FOSG target. Last, a latent-space LQR
controller drives the gripper toward this tactile imprint with minimal
actuation, preventing unnecessary compression. Trained on a physics-conditioned
tactile dataset covering diverse objects and contact conditions, the proposed
Phy-LDM achieves superior tactile prediction accuracy, while the Phy-Tac
outperforms fixed-force and GraspNet-based baselines in grasp stability and
force efficiency. Experiments on classical robotic platforms demonstrate
force-efficient and adaptive manipulation that bridges the gap between robotic
and human grasping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing assistive systems face challenges in planning around risks, personalizing for users, and grounding language plans into actions, particularly in cluttered home settings. The research aims to enhance these aspects using MLLMs.

Method: The study introduces MARS, which employs four agents: a visual perception agent for environmental analysis, a risk assessment agent to prioritize hazards, a planning agent to plan actions, and an evaluation agent for iterative optimization. These agents work collaboratively using hierarchical decision-making.

Result: Experiments conducted on multiple datasets indicate that MARS outperforms current state-of-the-art multimodal models in risk-aware planning and effective collaboration among agents.

Conclusion: MARS demonstrates the utility of multimodal large language models in real-world assistive scenarios, offering significant advancements in adaptive assistance and providing a generalizable framework for deploying such systems.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
in cross-modal understanding and reasoning, offering new opportunities for
intelligent assistive systems, yet existing systems still struggle with
risk-aware planning, user personalization, and grounding language plans into
executable skills in cluttered homes. We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic
System powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home
robots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents:
a visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from
environment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing
hazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an
evaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception
with hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive,
risk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments.
Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance
of the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent
execution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models. The proposed
approach also highlights the potential of collaborative AI for practical
assistive scenarios and provides a generalizable methodology for deploying
MLLM-enabled multi-agent systems in real-world environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a Unified Diffusion Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates understanding, generating, and acting across modalities through a joint diffusion process to achieve state-of-the-art performance and efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing Vision-Language-Action models, which either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, reducing synergy between tasks.

Method: Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P) which integrate multiple modalities into a single denoising process. It introduces a unified tokenized modality space, hybrid attention mechanism, a two-stage training pipeline, and novel inference-time techniques.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks (CALVIN, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) with inference speeds up to four times faster than autoregressive methods.

Conclusion: The Unified Diffusion VLA model demonstrates the capability to unify vision, language, and action tasks in a synergistic manner, providing efficiency and improved performance in embodied agent tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language
instructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an
embodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the
understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand,
generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and
actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality
unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate
processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our
core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a
synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions
to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance.
We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint
Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process
that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve
as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be
intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified
tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques
that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and
SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we
demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world
evaluations. Our project page is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight actuation-space learning framework for soft robotic grasping, achieving high success rates with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of robotic grasping under uncertain and contact-rich conditions, leveraging the natural adaptability of soft robots.

Method: A flow matching model, Rectified Flow, is used to learn distributional control directly from limited deterministic demonstrations without dense sensing or complex control systems.

Result: The learned policy achieved a 97.5% grasp success rate across the workspace, demonstrating generalization to object size variations and scalability in dynamic response time adjustments.

Conclusion: Actuation-space learning effectively utilizes the mechanical intelligence of soft robots, reducing reliance on complex central controllers and improving grasp performance under uncertainty.

Abstract: Robotic grasping under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge due to its
uncertain and contact-rich nature. Traditional rigid robotic hands, with
limited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and
heavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by
contrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated
structures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate
uncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability,
we propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers
distributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping,
directly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model
(Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using
only 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned
policy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace,
generalizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable
performance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling
the execution time from 20% to 200%. These results demonstrate that
actuation-space learning, by leveraging its passive redundant DOFs and
flexibility, converts the body's mechanics into functional control intelligence
and substantially reduces the burden on central controllers for this
uncertain-rich task.

Abstract: This article presents a Multi-Modal Bipedal Intelligent Urban Scout robot
(MOBIUS) capable of walking, crawling, climbing, and rolling. MOBIUS features
four limbs--two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and
climbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across
diverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture
combines reinforcement learning-based locomotion with model-based predictive
and admittance control enhanced for safety by a Reference Governor toward
compliant contact interactions. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects
locomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware
experiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and
full-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the
importance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and
control to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially
expanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenge of data scarcity in embodied intelligence, specifically in dexterous manipulation, which requires nuanced and diverse simulation environments for effective training.

Method: The proposed method, GenDexHand, integrates a generative simulation pipeline with a closed-loop refinement process guided by vision-language model feedback to improve the quality of simulations. It also decomposes tasks into sub-tasks for sequential reinforcement learning.

Result: GenDexHand substantially enhances the quality of task generation, reducing training time and improving success rates in learning dexterous hand behaviors.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable synthetic data generation solution for training dexterous robotic hands, advancing the training process for embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental bottleneck for embodied intelligence.
Existing approaches use large language models (LLMs) to automate gripper-based
simulation generation, but they transfer poorly to dexterous manipulation,
which demands more specialized environment design. Meanwhile, dexterous
manipulation tasks are inherently more difficult due to their higher degrees of
freedom. Massively generating feasible and trainable dexterous hand tasks
remains an open challenge. To this end, we present GenDexHand, a generative
simulation pipeline that autonomously produces diverse robotic tasks and
environments for dexterous manipulation. GenDexHand introduces a closed-loop
refinement process that adjusts object placements and scales based on
vision-language model (VLM) feedback, substantially improving the average
quality of generated environments. Each task is further decomposed into
sub-tasks to enable sequential reinforcement learning, reducing training time
and increasing success rates. Our work provides a viable path toward scalable
training of diverse dexterous hand behaviors in embodied intelligence by
offering a simulation-based solution to synthetic data generation. Our website:

By leveraging an existing CSI dataset, our approach integrates a Convolutional

into synthetic images using the TINTO tool. The localisation solution is
integrated with a robotics simulator, and the Robot Operating System (ROS),
which facilitates its evaluation through heterogeneous test cases, and the
adoption of state estimators like Kalman filters. Our contributions illustrate
the potential of our HyNN model in achieving precise indoor localisation and

TL;DR: This paper studies tool retrieval methods for regulated enterprise environments by developing ScaleCall, a tool-calling framework. It reveals trade-offs in retrieval methods and validates findings through Mastercard’s real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges and optimization needs for tool retrieval methods in regulated enterprise environments like fintech, considering constraints such as compliance and overlapping tool functionalities.

Method: Developed the ScaleCall framework at Mastercard and systematically compared embedding-based retrieval, prompt-based ranking, and hybrid approaches using enterprise benchmarks.

Result: Embedding-based methods showed better latency for large repositories; listwise ranking excelled in disambiguation; hybrid approaches found contextual promise. Empirical evaluations validate these trade-offs.

Conclusion: Integrating findings into ScaleCall framework improves understanding of retrieval trade-offs and informs tool-calling system designs in regulated industries.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tool calling, deploying these
capabilities in regulated enterprise environments such as fintech presents
unique challenges due to on-premises constraints, regulatory compliance
requirements, and the need to disambiguate large, functionally overlapping
toolsets. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of tool retrieval
methods for enterprise environments through the development and deployment of
ScaleCall, a prototype tool-calling framework within Mastercard designed for
orchestrating internal APIs and automating data engineering workflows. We
systematically evaluate embedding-based retrieval, prompt-based listwise
ranking, and hybrid approaches, revealing that method effectiveness depends
heavily on domain-specific factors rather than inherent algorithmic
superiority. Through empirical investigation on enterprise-derived benchmarks,
we find that embedding-based methods offer superior latency for large tool
repositories, while listwise ranking provides better disambiguation for
overlapping functionalities, with hybrid approaches showing promise in specific
contexts. We integrate our findings into ScaleCall's flexible architecture and

### [379] [Adding New Capability in Existing Scientific Application with LLM Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00087)
*Anshu Dubey,Akash Dhruv*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on using large language models (LLMs) for coding new algorithms and introduces enhancements to a tool, Code-Scribe, to assist in generating such code from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the less-explored aspect of generating code for new algorithms where existing training data lacks prior examples.

Method: The study proposes a methodology for writing code from scratch for new algorithms with the help of LLMs and enhances the Code-Scribe tool for better support in this task.

Result: The paper describes improvements made to the Code-Scribe tool, demonstrating its capability to assist in generating code for novel algorithms.

Conclusion: Using LLMs combined with tools like an improved version of Code-Scribe can facilitate code generation for new algorithms not previously represented in training data.

Abstract: With the emergence and rapid evolution of large language models (LLM),
automating coding tasks has become an im- portant research topic. Many efforts
are underway and liter- ature abounds about the efficacy of models and their
ability to generate code. A less explored aspect of code generation is for new
algorithms, where the training data-set would not have included any previous
example of similar code. In this paper we propose a new methodology for writing
code from scratch for a new algorithm using LLM assistance, and describe
enhancement of a previously developed code- translation tool, Code-Scribe, for
new code generation.

### [380] [Inferring multiple helper Dafny assertions with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00125)
*Álvaro Silva,Alexandra Mendes,Ruben Martins*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer missing assertions in Dafny programs, implementing a tool called DAISY, showcasing improved verification efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually adding helper assertions in Dafny programs presents a barrier to adoption due to the considerable effort required, especially when assertions are missing.

Method: The authors developed DAISY (Dafny Assertion Inference SYstem), combining LLM predictions with error-message heuristics, supported by datasets where assertions are curated at varying levels of absence.

Result: DAISY verifies 63.4% of programs with one missing assertion and 31.7% with multiple missing assertions, showcasing that proofs can be validly repaired with fewer assertions.

Conclusion: Automated inference can greatly reduce manual proof efforts in formal verification, increasing scalability and accessibility while revealing multiple valid proof strategies.

Abstract: The Dafny verifier provides strong correctness guarantees but often requires
numerous manual helper assertions, creating a significant barrier to adoption.
We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically infer
missing helper assertions in Dafny programs, with a primary focus on cases
involving multiple missing assertions. To support this study, we extend the
DafnyBench benchmark with curated datasets where one, two, or all assertions
are removed, and we introduce a taxonomy of assertion types to analyze
inference difficulty. Our approach refines fault localization through a hybrid
method that combines LLM predictions with error-message heuristics. We
implement this approach in a new tool called DAISY (Dafny Assertion Inference
SYstem). While our focus is on multiple missing assertions, we also evaluate
DAISY on single-assertion cases. DAISY verifies 63.4% of programs with one
missing assertion and 31.7% with multiple missing assertions. Notably, many
programs can be verified with fewer assertions than originally present,
highlighting that proofs often admit multiple valid repair strategies and that
recovering every original assertion is unnecessary. These results demonstrate
that automated assertion inference can substantially reduce proof engineering
effort and represent a step toward more scalable and accessible formal
verification.

### [381] [What a diff makes: automating code migration with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00160)
*Katherine A. Rosenfeld,Cliff C. Kerr,Jessica Lundin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for maintaining code compatibility during dependency changes and introduces AIMigrate, a tool for code migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of code migration and compatibility when software dependencies undergo major or minor updates, breaking dependent projects.

Method: The method involves leveraging LLMs with diff-based contexts to improve test coverage and performance in automating code migration. AIMigrate, a Python tool aiding code adaptation, is introduced.

Result: AIMigrate achieved a 65% correct change identification rate in one run, which increased to 80% with multiple runs. Additionally, 47% of changes were generated perfectly.

Conclusion: Using LLMs with diffs can enhance performance in code migration scenarios. AIMigrate shows potential in assisting real-world code migrations and improving compatibility with changing dependencies.

Abstract: Modern software programs are built on stacks that are often undergoing
changes that introduce updates and improvements, but may also break any project
that depends upon them. In this paper we explore the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for code migration, specifically the problem of maintaining
compatibility with a dependency as it undergoes major and minor semantic
version changes. We demonstrate, using metrics such as test coverage and change
comparisons, that contexts containing diffs can significantly improve
performance against out of the box LLMs and, in some cases, perform better than
using code. We provide a dataset to assist in further development of this
problem area, as well as an open-source Python package, AIMigrate, that can be
used to assist with migrating code bases. In a real-world migration of
TYPHOIDSIM between STARSIM versions, AIMigrate correctly identified 65% of
required changes in a single run, increasing to 80% with multiple runs, with
47% of changes generated perfectly.

### [382] [Understanding Code Agent Behaviour: An Empirical Study of Success and Failure Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00197)
*Oorja Majgaonkar,Zhiwei Fei,Xiang Li,Federica Sarro,He Ye*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates the problem-solving behaviour of large language model agents for software engineering tasks, using trajectory analysis of their execution traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of LLM agents for software tasks necessitates understanding their decision-making processes beyond mere success metrics.

Method: Empirical analysis of agent trajectories from three code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, contrasting successful and failed attempts.

Result: The study found differences in problem-solving strategies, trajectory characteristics, and fault localisation performance across agents, noting that approximate modifications are crucial for success.

Conclusion: Trajectory analysis offers valuable insights into LLM agent behaviour, promoting the creation of more robust autonomous software engineering systems.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for complex
software engineering tasks has created a need to understand their
problem-solving behaviours beyond simple success metrics. While these agents
demonstrate impressive capabilities in automated issue resolution, their
decision-making processes remain largely opaque. This paper presents an
empirical study of agent trajectories, namely the execution traces capturing
the steps agents take when attempting to resolve software issues. We analyse
trajectories from three state-of-the-art code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and
Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, examining both successful and failed
attempts. Our investigation reveals several key insights into agent behaviour.
First, we identify how distinct problem-solving strategies, such as defensive
programming and context gathering, enable success in different scenarios.
Second, we find that failed trajectories are consistently longer and exhibit
higher variance than successful ones, with failure patterns differing
significantly between agents. Third, our fault localisation analysis shows that
while most trajectories correctly identify problematic files (72-81\% even in
failures), success depends more on achieving approximate rather than exact code
modifications. These and other findings unveiled by our study, provide a
foundation for understanding agent behaviour through trajectory analysis,
contributing to the development of more robust and interpretable autonomous
software engineering systems.

### [383] [Position: Vibe Coding Needs Vibe Reasoning: Improving Vibe Coding with Formal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00202)
*Jacqueline Mitchell,Yasser Shaaban*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges in "vibe coding" with LLMs, like technical debt and code churn, and suggests integrating formal methods via a side-car system for improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent rise in "vibe coding" with LLMs has shown popularity, but exhibited shortcomings such as technical debt and code inconsistency, needing solutions for reliable development.

Method: Proposes a side-car system integration that autoformalizes specifications, validates against targets, delivers actionable feedback to LLMs, and allows intuitive developer influence in the process.

Result: The side-car system aims to address current pitfalls, optimizing code reliability through improved methods supporting LLM-guided development.

Conclusion: Better integration of formal methods with LLMs will result in improved reliability and consistency, helping developers achieve better outcomes in vibe coding.

Abstract: ``Vibe coding'' -- the practice of developing software through iteratively
conversing with a large language model (LLM) -- has exploded in popularity
within the last year. However, developers report key limitations including the
accumulation of technical debt, security issues, and code churn to achieve
satisfactory results. We argue that these pitfalls result from LLMs' inability
to reconcile accumulating human-imposed constraints during vibe coding, with
developers inadvertently failing to resolve contradictions because LLMs
prioritize user commands over code consistency. Given LLMs' receptiveness to
verification-based feedback, we argue that formal methods can mitigate these
pitfalls, making vibe coding more reliable. However, we posit that integrating
formal methods must transcend existing approaches that combine formal methods
and LLMs. We advocate for a side-car system throughout the vibe coding process
which: (1) \emph{Autoformalizes} specifications (2) Validates against targets,
(3) Delivers \emph{actionable} feedback to the LLM, and (4) Allows intuitive
developer influence on specifications.

*Xiaomeng Xu,Zahin Wahab,Reid Holmes,Caroline Lemieux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocPrism, a tool for detecting code-documentation inconsistencies using large language models (LLMs), and provides a methodology to reduce false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-documentation inconsistencies can cause misunderstandings and software defects, necessitating tools to identify these discrepancies efficiently across different programming languages.

Method: The paper introduces the Local Categorization, External Filtering (LCEF) methodology, which leverages LLM's local completion skills to reduce false positives in detecting code-documentation inconsistencies.

Result: Using the LCEF methodology, inconsistency flags reduced from 98% to 14%, accuracy increased from 14% to 94%, and in broader evaluation across multiple languages, DocPrism achieved 15% flag rate and 0.62 precision, without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DocPrism effectively detects code-documentation inconsistencies with reduced false positives, demonstrating significant potential in software engineering and multi-language support.

Abstract: Code-documentation inconsistencies are common and undesirable: they can lead
to developer misunderstandings and software defects. This paper introduces
DocPrism, a multi-language, code-documentation inconsistency detection tool.
DocPrism uses a standard large language model (LLM) to analyze and explain
inconsistencies. Plain use of LLMs for this task yield unacceptably high false
positive rates: LLMs identify natural gaps between high-level documentation and
detailed code implementations as inconsistencies. We introduce and apply the
Local Categorization, External Filtering (LCEF) methodology to reduce false
positives. LCEF relies on the LLM's local completion skills rather than its
long-term reasoning skills. In our ablation study, LCEF reduces DocPrism's
inconsistency flag rate from 98% to 14%, and increases accuracy from 14% to
94%. On a broad evaluation across Python, TypeScript, C++, and Java, DocPrism
maintains a low flag rate of 15%, and achieves a precision of 0.62 without
performing any fine-tuning.

*Romina Etezadi,Sallam Abualhaija,Chetan Arora,Lionel Briand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes ProReFiCIA, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to automatically identify impacted requirements during software changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of manual requirement impact analysis, which is prone to errors and inefficiency.

Method: ProReFiCIA employs LLMs paired with tailored prompt variants to analyze and identify changes and impacted requirements.

Result: Achieved 93.3% recall on a benchmark dataset and 95.8% recall on an industry dataset with minimal review effort (2.1-8.5% of requirements).

Conclusion: ProReFiCIA demonstrates high effectiveness and efficiency, reducing manual effort while reliably identifying requirement impacts.

Abstract: Requirements are inherently subject to changes throughout the software
development lifecycle. Within the limited budget available to requirements
engineers, manually identifying the impact of such changes on other
requirements is both error-prone and effort-intensive. That might lead to
overlooked impacted requirements, which, if not properly managed, can cause
serious issues in the downstream tasks. Inspired by the growing potential of
large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, we propose ProReFiCIA, an
LLM-driven approach for automatically identifying the impacted requirements
when changes occur. We conduct an extensive evaluation of ProReFiCIA using
several LLMs and prompts variants tailored to this task. Using the best
combination of an LLM and a prompt variant, ProReFiCIA achieves a recall of
93.3% on a benchmark dataset and 95.8% on a newly created industry dataset,
demonstrating its strong effectiveness in identifying impacted requirements.
Further, the cost of applying ProReFiCIA remains small, as the engineer only
needs to review the generated results, which represent between 2.1% and 8.5% of
the entire set of requirements.

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale analysis connecting Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) comments to their surrounding source code constructs using the PENTACET dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the research gap in understanding the connection between SATD comments and their affected source code, enabling proactive software maintenance.

Method: Analyzed the PENTACET dataset with over 9000 Java OSS repositories, quantitatively identifying common occurrences of SATD in specific code constructs such as definitions, conditionals, and exception handling.

Result: The study links 225,000 SATD comments to their surrounding code, showing that SATD primarily arises in inline code dealing with uncertainty and trade-offs.

Conclusion: SATD is not just a sign of neglect but an intentional signal of awareness around code changes, helping address software maintenance challenges.

Abstract: Context. Detecting Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is crucial for
proactive software maintenance. Previous research has primarily targeted
detecting and prioritizing SATD, with little focus on the source code afflicted
with SATD. Our goal in this work is to connect the SATD comments with source
code constructs that surround them.
  Method. We leverage the extensive SATD dataset PENTACET, containing code
comments from over 9000 Java Open Source Software (OSS) repositories. We
quantitatively infer where SATD most commonly occurs and which code
constructs/statements it most frequently affects.
  Results and Conclusions. Our large-scale study links over 225,000 SATD
comments to their surrounding code, showing that SATD mainly arises in inline
code near definitions, conditionals, and exception handling, where developers
face uncertainty and trade-offs, revealing it as an intentional signal of
awareness during change rather than mere neglect.

### [388] [SmartDoc: A Context-Aware Agentic Method Comment Generation Plugin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00450)
*Vahid Etemadi,Gregorio Robles*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A plugin named SmartDoc for IntelliJ IDEA is proposed to generate precise, context-aware Java method comments autonomously, achieving accuracy metrics in the range of 0.80-0.90 for BERTScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve program comprehension during software maintenance by providing clear and contemporary comments for methods that help developers understand code implementation details effectively.

Method: SmartDoc operates as an AI agent interacting with Large Language Models. It constructs a call graph using Depth-First Search (DFS) to retrieve context concerning the target method and uses this enriched context for generating method comments.

Result: SmartDoc was tested on dedicated scenarios for Java codebases. Metrics of precision, recall, and F1 scores were measured using BERTScore, ROUGE-1, and BLEU and yielded accuracy between 0.80 and 0.90.

Conclusion: SmartDoc demonstrates high accuracy in generating comments for Java methods, enriching program understanding and supporting software maintenance activities. Its high precision and recall indicate its effectiveness and reliability.

Abstract: Context: The software maintenance phase involves many activities such as code
refactoring, bug fixing, code review or testing. Program comprehension is key
to all these activities, as it demands developers to grasp the knowledge (e.g.,
implementation details) required to modify the codebase. Methods as main
building blocks in a program can offer developers this knowledge source for
code comprehension. However, reading entire method statements can be
challenging, which necessitates precise and up-to-date comments. Objective: We
propose a solution as an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, named SmartDoc, that assists
developers in generating context-aware method comments. Method: This plugin
acts as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that has its own memory and is
augmented by target methods' context. When a request is initiated by the
end-user, the method content and all its nested method calls are used in the
comment generation. At the beginning, these nested methods are visited and a
call graph is generated. This graph is then traversed using depth-first search
(DFS), enabling the provision of full-context to enrich Large Language Model
(LLM) prompts. Result: The product is a software, as a plugin, developed for
Java codebase and installable on IntelliJ IDEA. This plugin can serve
concurrently for methods whose comments are being updated , and it shares
memory across all flows to avoid redundant calls. o measure the accuracy of
this solution, a dedicated test case is run to record SmartDoc generated
comments and their corresponding ground truth. For each collected result-set,
three metrics are computed, BERTScore, BLEU and ROUGE-1. These metrics will
determine how accurate the generated comments are in comparison to the ground
truth. Result: The obtained accuracy, in terms of the precision, recall and F1,
is promising, and lies in the range of 0.80 to 0.90 for BERTScore.

*Liu Wang,Dong Wang,Shidong Pan,Zheng Jiang,Haoyu Wang,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Apple's App Privacy Report feature in iOS 15.2, revealing its limitations and proposing enhancements to improve user privacy transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The introduction of App Privacy Report aimed to improve user awareness regarding mobile apps' data practices, but its real-world impact and effectiveness needed deeper examination.

Method: The authors conducted an end-to-end study combining systematic assessments of App Privacy Report, enhancements using LLMs and other techniques, and user-focused evaluations through structured focus group studies.

Result: The study found that App Privacy Report has limited practical impact due to missing details on data access purposes and domain descriptions. Proposed enhancements addressed these gaps effectively.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable enhancements and insights on improving privacy transparency, contributing to ongoing discussions and developments in user data protection.

Abstract: The prevalent engagement with mobile apps underscores the importance of
understanding their data practices. Transparency plays a crucial role in this
context, ensuring users to be informed and give consent before any data access
occurs. Apple introduced a new feature since iOS 15.2, App Privacy Report, to
inform users about detailed insights into apps' data access and sharing. This
feature continues Apple's trend of privacy-focused innovations (following
Privacy Nutrition Labels), and has been marketed as a big step forward in user
privacy. However, its real-world impacts on user privacy and control remain
unexamined. We thus proposed an end-to-end study involving systematic
assessment of the App Privacy Report's real-world benefits and limitations,
LLM-enabled and multi-technique synthesized enhancements, and comprehensive
evaluation from both system and user perspectives. Through a structured focus
group study with twelve everyday iOS users, we explored their experiences,
understanding, and perceptions of the feature, suggesting its limited practical
impact resulting from missing important details. We identified two primary user
concerns: the clarity of data access purpose and domain description. In
response, we proposed enhancements including a purpose inference framework and
domain clarification pipeline. We demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits
of such enhancements for mobile app users. This work provides practical
insights that could help enhance user privacy transparency and discusses areas
for future research.

*Shuochuan Li,Dong Wang,Patanamon Thongtanunam,Zan Wang,Jiuqiao Yu,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RevAgent is an advanced framework for automated code review comment generation that uses multiple agents to improve comment relevance and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated comment generation methods are limited by relying on single models, resulting in generic and less informative comments, especially for complex code changes like bug fixes.

Method: RevAgent uses a three-stage agent-based framework for generating code review comments: (1) comment generation by category-specific agents, (2) selection of appropriate comments by a critic agent, and (3) fine-tuning agents with tailored datasets.

Result: RevAgent improves performance metrics significantly over existing methods, with notable enhancements in BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and SBERT scores, and better identifies issue categories.

Conclusion: RevAgent effectively balances performance and efficiency, generating high-quality, context-aware review comments validated through human evaluations, making it a practical tool for code review.

Abstract: Code review (CR) is a crucial practice for ensuring software quality. Various
automated review comment generation techniques have been proposed to streamline
the labor-intensive process. However, existing approaches heavily rely on a
single model to identify various issues within the code, limiting the model's
ability to handle the diverse, issue-specific nature of code changes and
leading to non-informative comments, especially in complex scenarios such as
bug fixes. To address these limitations, we propose RevAgent, a novel
agent-based issue-oriented framework, decomposes the task into three stages:
(1) Generation Stage, where five category-specific commentator agents analyze
code changes from distinct issue perspectives and generate candidate comments;
(2) Discrimination Stage, where a critic agent selects the most appropriate
issue-comment pair; and (3) Training Stage, where all agents are fine-tuned on
curated, category-specific data to enhance task specialization. Evaluation
results show that RevAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PLM- and
LLM-based baselines, with improvements of 12.90\%, 10.87\%, 6.32\%, and 8.57\%
on BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and SBERT, respectively. It also achieves relatively
higher accuracy in issue-category identification, particularly for challenging
scenarios. Human evaluations further validate the practicality of RevAgent in
generating accurate, readable, and context-aware review comments. Moreover,
RevAgent delivers a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIP-LLM, a hierarchical framework to assess the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing their probabilistic behavior under real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rigorous and probabilistic reliability assessment methods for LLMs as their deployment spans various domains, overcoming limitations of current benchmark-based evaluations.

Method: HIP-LLM leverages a Hierarchical Imprecise Probability framework, embedding epistemic uncertainty and operational profiles for multi-level reliability inference from subdomain to system level.

Result: Experiments indicate HIP-LLM provides a more precise, standardized method for LLM reliability quantification and surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: HIP-LLM establishes a robust model for LLM reliability assessment, enhancing predictive reliability and its real-world applicability. A public repository offers accessibility for further exploration and adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, raising the need for rigorous reliability assessment methods. Existing
benchmark-based evaluations primarily offer descriptive statistics of model
accuracy over datasets, providing limited insight into the probabilistic
behavior of LLMs under real operational conditions. This paper introduces
HIP-LLM, a Hierarchical Imprecise Probability framework for modeling and
inferring LLM reliability. Building upon the foundations of software
reliability engineering, HIP-LLM defines LLM reliability as the probability of
failure-free operation over a specified number of future tasks under a given
Operational Profile (OP). HIP-LLM represents dependencies across (sub-)domains
hierarchically, enabling multi-level inference from subdomain to system-level
reliability. HIP-LLM embeds imprecise priors to capture epistemic uncertainty
and incorporates OPs to reflect usage contexts. It derives posterior
reliability envelopes that quantify uncertainty across priors and data.
Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIP-LLM offers a
more accurate and standardized reliability characterization than existing
benchmark and state-of-the-art approaches. A publicly accessible repository of
HIP-LLM is provided.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GDPR-Bench-Android, a benchmark designed for evaluating automated detection methods of GDPR violations in Android applications using various paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating GDPR compliance detection in source code is critical yet underexplored, especially given the complexity of GDPR requirements in software development.

Method: The authors created GDPR-Bench-Android with 1951 annotated violation instances from 15 open-source repositories and introduced Formal-AST, a deterministic source-code-native formal method. They defined multi-granularity violation localization and snippet-level multi-label classification tasks.

Result: Results showed task-dependent strengths across methods, with ReAct achieving the highest file-level accuracy, Qwen2.5-72B LLM leading line-level accuracy, Claude-Sonnet-4.5 excelling in macro-F1, and the RAG method demonstrating the highest macro-precision.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights the varying strengths of different automated approaches, offering a valuable tool for diagnosing capabilities and advancing GDPR compliance detection.

Abstract: Automating the detection of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
violations in source code is a critical but underexplored challenge. We
introduce \textbf{GDPR-Bench-Android}, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating diverse automated methods for GDPR compliance detection in Android
applications. It contains \textbf{1951} manually annotated violation instances
from \textbf{15} open-source repositories, covering 23 GDPR articles at file-,
module-, and line-level granularities. To enable a multi-paradigm evaluation,
we contribute \textbf{Formal-AST}, a novel, source-code-native formal method
that serves as a deterministic baseline. We define two tasks: (1)
\emph{multi-granularity violation localization}, evaluated via
Accuracy@\textit{k}; and (2) \emph{snippet-level multi-label classification},
assessed by macro-F1 and other classification metrics. We benchmark 11 methods,
including eight state-of-the-art LLMs, our Formal-AST analyzer, a
retrieval-augmented (RAG) method, and an agentic (ReAct) method. Our findings
reveal that no single paradigm excels across all tasks. For Task 1, the ReAct
agent achieves the highest file-level Accuracy@1 (17.38%), while the
Qwen2.5-72B LLM leads at the line level (61.60%), in stark contrast to the
Formal-AST method's 1.86%. For the difficult multi-label Task 2, the
Claude-Sonnet-4.5 LLM achieves the best Macro-F1 (5.75%), while the RAG method
yields the highest Macro-Precision (7.10%). These results highlight the
task-dependent strengths of different automated approaches and underscore the
value of our benchmark in diagnosing their capabilities. All resources are

### [394] [Can Large Language Models Detect Real-World Android Software Compliance Violations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00624)
*Haoyi Zhang,Huaijin Ran,Xunzhu Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompliBench, a framework for evaluating LLMs on compliance detection tasks in Android applications. It involves locating violations and assessing regulations across jurisdictions, with new metrics for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle in detecting compliance violations across diverse legal frameworks, hindering their application in ensuring regulations in Android apps.

Method: Two tasks are defined: (1) retrieval and localization of violations at detailed code granularities, and (2) multi-label judgment for snippets. Metrics are introduced to capture cross-granularity stability and jurisdictional consistency.

Result: Experiments with six models show improved compliance detection using CompliBench. Claude-3.5-sonnet achieves the highest OCS score, demonstrating better compliance handling.

Conclusion: CompliBench enhances LLM evaluation for compliance tasks and lays the groundwork for tools aligned with legal standards. It shows potential for improving data protection compliance in software systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed
software engineering, showing promise in tasks like code generation, bug
detection, and compliance checking. However, current models struggle to detect
compliance violations in Android applications across diverse legal frameworks.
We propose \emph{CompliBench}, a novel evaluation framework for assessing LLMs'
ability to detect compliance violations under regulations like LGPD, PDPA, and
PIPEDA. The framework defines two tasks: Task 1 evaluates \emph{retrieval and
localization} at file, module, and line granularities, and Task 2 assesses
\emph{multi-label judgment} for code snippets. These tasks mirror the audit
process, where auditors locate problematic code and determine implicated
provisions. Traditional metrics fail to capture important aspects like
cross-granularity stability and jurisdictional consistency. Thus, we introduce
stability-aware composites (SGS, RCS, CRGS, and OCS) for a more comprehensive
assessment. Experiments with six models, including GPT-4O and Claude-3.5, show
\emph{CompliBench} improves compliance detection, with
Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 achieving the highest OCS score (0.3295), and
Gemini-2.5-pro the lowest (0.0538). This work demonstrates \emph{CompliBench}'s
potential for improving LLM performance in compliance tasks and provides a
foundation for future tools aligned with data protection standards. Our project

Motivation: To leverage Generative AI in software engineering for enhancing productivity and quality in clinical trials software development.

Method: Documenting experiences and observations from incorporating Generative AI in project management, requirements specification, design, development, and quality assurance of a web-based system.

Result: Early results and lessons learned provide valuable suggestions for organizations considering integrating Generative AI for software development.

Conclusion: Generative AI holds potential for improving SE practices, though its technological maturity and definitive evidence are in early stages. The insights shared help guide innovative development approaches using AI.

Abstract: The advances and availability of technologies involving Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) are evolving clearly and explicitly, driving immediate
changes in various work activities. Software Engineering (SE) is no exception
and stands to benefit from these new technologies, enhancing productivity and
quality in its software development processes. However, although the use of
Generative AI in SE practices is still in its early stages, considering the
lack of conclusive results from ongoing research and the limited technological
maturity, we have chosen to incorporate these technologies in the development
of a web-based software system to be used in clinical trials by a thoracic
diseases research group at our university. For this reason, we decided to share
this experience report documenting our development team's learning journey in
using Generative AI during the software development process. Project
management, requirements specification, design, development, and quality
assurance activities form the scope of observation. Although we do not yet have
definitive technological evidence to evolve our development process
significantly, the results obtained and the suggestions shared here represent
valuable insights for software organizations seeking to innovate their
development practices to achieve software quality with generative AI.

*Tasmia Zerin,Moumita Asad,B. M. Mainul Hossain,Kazi Sakib*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReDeFix, an automated solution, uses Stack Overflow knowledge and large language models (LLMs) to fix Responsive Layout Failures (RLFs) in websites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually repairing distorted layouts in responsive websites is time-consuming and prone to errors, requiring an automated, efficient approach.

Method: ReDeFix combines LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using domain-specific Stack Overflow discussions to direct CSS repairs.

Result: The proposed system achieved 88% accuracy in fixing RLFs and maintained visual correctness and aesthetics as confirmed by software engineers.

Conclusion: ReDeFix effectively repairs responsive layout issues, leveraging community knowledge and automation to reduce the manual burden on developers.

Abstract: Responsive websites frequently experience distorted layouts at specific
screen sizes, called Responsive Layout Failures (RLFs). Manually repairing
these RLFs involves tedious trial-and-error adjustments of HTML elements and
CSS properties. In this study, an automated repair approach, leveraging LLM
combined with domain-specific knowledge is proposed. The approach is named
ReDeFix, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based solution that utilizes
Stack Overflow (SO) discussions to guide LLM on CSS repairs. By augmenting
relevant SO knowledge with RLF-specific contexts, ReDeFix creates a prompt that
is sent to the LLM to generate CSS patches. Evaluation demonstrates that our
approach achieves an 88\% accuracy in repairing RLFs. Furthermore, a study from
software engineers reveals that generated repairs produce visually correct
layouts while maintaining aesthetics.

### [397] [An Empirical Investigation of the Experiences of Dyslexic Software Engineers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00706)
*Marcos Vinicius Cruz,Pragya Verma,Grischa Liebel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the experiences of dyslexic software engineers, emphasizing their struggles during programming learning stages and their strengths in visual thinking and creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dyslexia influences software engineers' performance, challenges, and strengths, as well as to examine their unique experiences and needs in SE.

Method: A qualitative study using Socio-Technical Grounded Theory with data collected from 10 interviews, 3 blog posts, and 153 Reddit posts related to dyslexic software engineers.

Result: Dyslexic software engineers face difficulties during programming learning stages but excel in SE tasks once mastered. Support tools like code completion and linters mitigate their challenges while leveraging their strengths in visual thinking and creativity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for tailored SE support tools and future research on code comprehension for dyslexic individuals. Dyslexic engineers can succeed and excel with targeted assistance and recognition of their unique strengths.

Abstract: Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that primarily impairs an individual's
reading and writing abilities. In adults, dyslexia can affect both professional
and personal lives, often leading to mental challenges and difficulties
acquiring and keeping work. In Software Engineering (SE), reading and writing
difficulties appear to pose substantial challenges for core tasks such as
programming. However, initial studies indicate that these challenges may not
significantly affect their performance compared to non-dyslexic colleagues.
Conversely, strengths associated with dyslexia could be particularly valuable
in areas like programming and design. However, there is currently no work that
explores the experiences of dyslexic software engineers, and puts their
strengths into relation with their difficulties. To address this, we present a
qualitative study of the experiences of dyslexic individuals in SE. We followed
the basic stage of the Socio-Technical Grounded Theory method and base our
findings on data collected through 10 interviews with dyslexic software
engineers, 3 blog posts and 153 posts on the social media platform Reddit. We
find that dyslexic software engineers especially struggle at the programming
learning stage, but can succeed and indeed excel at many SE tasks once they
master this step. Common SE-specific support tools, such as code completion and
linters are especially useful to these individuals and mitigate many of the
experienced difficulties. Finally, dyslexic software engineers exhibit
strengths in areas such as visual thinking and creativity. Our findings have
implications to SE practice and motivate several areas of future research in
SE, such as investigating what makes code less/more understandable to dyslexic
individuals.

*Cuiyun Gao,Guodong Fan,Chun Yong Chong,Shizhan Chen,Chao Liu,David Lo,Zibin Zheng,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper surveys hallucination in code-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), summarizing causes, challenges, mitigation strategies, and evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LLMs is a pressing challenge, especially for high-stakes code intelligence tasks in software engineering.

Method: The authors systematically review 60 papers to analyze hallucination causes, mitigation strategies, code-specific challenges, and evaluation benchmarks.

Result: The paper identifies key factors contributing to hallucination, highlights approaches to mitigate it, and emphasizes the importance of evaluating hallucination-specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: By addressing hallucination challenges and proposing solutions, the paper guides research on improving code-oriented LLM reliability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Model hallucination is one of the most critical challenges faced by Large
Language Models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes code intelligence tasks. As
LLMs become increasingly integrated into software engineering tasks,
understanding and mitigating hallucination in code becomes essential. In this
survey, we provide a systematic review of hallucination phenomena in
code-oriented LLMs from four key perspectives. First, we begin by surveying 60
papers to define hallucination in the context of code and summarize its primary
causes, such as data noise, exposure bias, and insufficient semantic grounding,
while also tracing recent trends in literature across natural language
processing (NLP) and software engineering communities. Second, we review model
hallucination surveys in a broader span and summarize representative
hallucination mitigation strategies, such as knowledge-enhanced generation,
constrained decoding, and post-editing. Third, we review approaches targeted
for code intelligence and highlight code-specific challenges that aggravate
hallucination, including syntax sensitivity, strict type systems, and
dependence on external libraries. Meanwhile, we analyze how emerging code
intelligence tasks, e.g., program analysis, symbolic execution, and unit
testing, are utilized to detect and mitigate hallucinations. Fourth, we
summarize current evaluation benchmarks, ranging from static metrics to dynamic
checks, e.g., compilation and execution correctness, and emphasize the need for
hallucination-oriented benchmarks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Build-bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in repairing software builds during cross-ISA migrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of LLMs in resolving complex build failures during software migration across different instruction set architectures (ISAs).

Method: Development of Build-bench, an end-to-end benchmark comprising real-world failed packages, iterative repair processes, and integrated auxiliary tools to support autonomous reasoning.

Result: Comparative evaluation of six LLMs revealed a maximum build success rate of 63%, highlighting variability in tool usage and repair approaches across models.

Conclusion: Build-bench provides a systematic, architecture-aware evaluation framework that facilitates the study of LLM performance in cross-ISA software build and repair scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in software
engineering, yet few benchmarks evaluate their ability to repair software
during migration across instruction set architectures (ISAs). Cross-ISA
migration, such as between x86_64 and aarch64, requires handling complex
dependencies, heterogeneous toolchains, and long build logs while ensuring
executable verification. To address this challenge, we present Build-bench, an
end-to-end benchmark that systematically evaluates the capability of LLMs to
repair build failures in cross-ISA settings. Build-bench collects 268
real-world failed packages and integrates auxiliary tools including Structure
Extraction, File Content Extraction, Content Modification, and Build
Verification to support autonomous, tool-augmented reasoning. The repair
process operates in an iterative loop where, upon failure, the model receives
updated build logs and previous repair outcomes to refine subsequent attempts.
Through a comparative evaluation of six representative LLMs, Build-bench
reveals that current models achieve a maximum build success rate of 63% and
tool usage patterns differ significantly across models. By coupling real build
environments with verifiable outcomes, Build-bench establishes the first
architecture-aware benchmark for studying LLM-based software build and repair.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving offline A/B testing (OPE) using LLMs and presents benchmarks for large-scale datasets. The introduced two_agent framework optimizes code efficiency and demonstrates superior reliability and success compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize offline A/B testing (OPE) for evaluating technologies in domains where online testing is expensive or risky, such as healthcare and recommender systems, leveraging LLMs and agent-based approaches for better performance.

Method: The authors propose the GrowthHacker benchmark and two_agent framework, which iteratively optimize code and evaluate results using LLMs. They compare results across baseline methods with datasets and protocols established from Open Bandit Pipeline and Scope-RL.

Result: The two_agent framework outperformed baselines with 100% reliability, achieving an average improvement of 106.7% in positive outcomes. Success rates of 45% were reported, surpassing other methods like AutoGen (34%).

Conclusion: LLM-based agents are effective in enhancing OPE systems, presenting opportunities for scaling automated optimization processes in data-driven decision-making setups.

Abstract: With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B
testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such
experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and
involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy
evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess
technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in
domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare,
recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances
in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to
optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can
improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose
\textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on
large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates
results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established
protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline
(OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and
Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent}
framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization
effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability
and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both
two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated
"growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling
data-driven decision-making in production.

*John Yang,Kilian Lieret,Joyce Yang,Carlos E. Jimenez,Ofir Press,Ludwig Schmidt,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeClash, a benchmark for evaluating language models (LMs) in competitive programming scenarios to achieve open-ended objectives, revealing their limitations in strategic reasoning and long-term codebase management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between current AI coding benchmarks, which focus on isolated tasks, and real-world programming goals that require iterative and strategic development for higher-level objectives.

Method: CodeClash involves multi-round tournaments where LMs independently edit codebases to compete in arenas evaluating tasks like score maximization or resource management. Models' strategies and outcomes are analyzed over 25,200 rounds with 8 LMs and human competitors.

Result: The study found that LMs exhibit varied but strategically limited coding approaches, struggle with maintaining clean and efficient codebases over time, and perform worse than humans in competitive tasks.

Conclusion: While LMs show potential in certain areas of code development, they are far from matching human-level performance in strategic, long-term, and competitive programming. The CodeClash benchmark opens a pathway for further research on autonomous coding improvements.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for coding evaluate language models (LMs) on concrete,
well-specified tasks such as fixing specific bugs or writing targeted tests.
However, human programmers do not spend all day incessantly addressing isolated
tasks. Instead, real-world software development is grounded in the pursuit of
high-level goals, like improving user retention or reducing costs. Evaluating
whether LMs can also iteratively develop code to better accomplish open-ended
objectives without any explicit guidance remains an open challenge. To address
this, we introduce CodeClash, a benchmark where LMs compete in multi-round
tournaments to build the best codebase for achieving a competitive objective.
Each round proceeds in two phases: agents edit their code, then their codebases
compete head-to-head in a code arena that determines winners based on
objectives like score maximization, resource acquisition, or survival. Whether
it's writing notes, scrutinizing documentation, analyzing competition logs, or
creating test suites, models must decide for themselves how to improve their
codebases both absolutely and against their opponents. We run 1680 tournaments
(25,200 rounds total) to evaluate 8 LMs across 6 arenas. Our results reveal
that while models exhibit diverse development styles, they share fundamental
limitations in strategic reasoning. Models also struggle with long-term
codebase maintenance, as repositories become progressively messy and redundant.
These limitations are stark: top models lose every round against expert human
programmers. We open-source CodeClash to advance the study of autonomous,
goal-oriented code development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a study evaluating seven agent frameworks in software engineering tasks such as development, vulnerability detection, and program repair. Findings show varying capabilities, efficiency, and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on agent frameworks provide a fragmented understanding of their practical applications in software engineering. This paper aims to address the gap by offering a detailed evaluation.

Method: The study examines seven general-purpose agent frameworks across three code-related tasks using standard benchmarks. It evaluates effectiveness, efficiency, and overhead to identify performance patterns.

Result: Distinct patterns were observed: AgentOrchestra has longer decision processes, OpenHands excels in reflective reasoning, while GPTswarm is cost-efficient. Overall, agents showed moderate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The findings highlight trade-offs in agent performance, providing insights for practical adoption and further research in software engineering agents.

Abstract: Unlike traditional automation tools or static LLM-based systems, agents
combine decision-making and tool utilization to accomplish complex tasks,
showing great potential in software engineering. However, existing studies
largely focus on specific tasks or isolated aspects, providing an incomplete
picture of agents' practical capabilities. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical study evaluating seven general-purpose agent frameworks
across three representative code-centric tasks: software development,
vulnerability detection, and program repair. Each task is assessed using
standard, widely adopted benchmarks to ensure objective and comparable
evaluation. Agent performance is systematically analyzed from three
complementary perspectives: effectiveness (task success), efficiency (execution
process), and overhead (token consumption). Our findings reveal distinct
capability patterns and trade-offs among the evaluated frameworks. In terms of
effectiveness, agents achieve moderate overall performance. Regarding
efficiency, AgentOrchestra tends to exhibit the longest trajectories and the
most correction attempts due to coordination overhead, whereas OpenHands
demonstrate stronger reflective reasoning abilities. For overhead, software
development incurs the highest monetary cost, while GPTswarm remains the most
cost-efficient. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth cross-analysis of the
relationship between effectiveness and efficiency, exploring the underlying
reasons behind their interplay. These findings guide both practical adoption
and future research toward more efficient software engineering agents.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates sustainability in ML-enabled systems through interviews and surveys, uncovering gaps between awareness and implementation of sustainability practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of empirical evidence and practical understanding regarding the integration of multifaceted sustainability (environmental, social, economic) in ML-enabled systems.

Method: A mixed-method approach involving qualitative interviews with 8 experienced ML engineers and a large-scale quantitative survey with 203 ML practitioners.

Result: The study identifies a gap between sustainability awareness and systematic implementation and calls for structured guidelines, measurement frameworks, and regulatory support.

Conclusion: Sustainability in ML workflows requires actionable frameworks and tools to bridge the gap between theoretical awareness and practical implementation.

Abstract: Software sustainability is a key multifaceted non-functional requirement that
encompasses environmental, social, and economic concerns, yet its integration
into the development of Machine Learning (ML)-enabled systems remains an open
challenge. While previous research has explored high-level sustainability
principles and policy recommendations, limited empirical evidence exists on how
sustainability is practically managed in ML workflows. Existing studies
predominantly focus on environmental sustainability, e.g., carbon footprint
reduction, while missing the broader spectrum of sustainability dimensions and
the challenges practitioners face in real-world settings. To address this gap,
we conduct an empirical study to characterize sustainability in ML-enabled
systems from a practitioner's perspective. We investigate (1) how ML engineers
perceive and describe sustainability, (2) the software engineering practices
they adopt to support it, and (3) the key challenges hindering its adoption. We
first perform a qualitative analysis based on interviews with eight experienced
ML engineers, followed by a large-scale quantitative survey with 203 ML
practitioners. Our key findings reveal a significant disconnection between
sustainability awareness and its systematic implementation, highlighting the
need for more structured guidelines, measurement frameworks, and regulatory
support.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the evolution and effectiveness of NetBSD's automated testing framework over a span of more than a decade, highlighting growth and stability despite occasional periods of test and build failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the long-term performance, stability, and growth of NetBSD's automated test suite, offering insights into the efficacy of continuous software testing in large-scale systems.

Method: A longitudinal empirical analysis spanning over a decade was conducted, examining test suite growth, stability of failed test cases, and the influence of factors like code churn and kernel modifications.

Result: The test suite expanded to over 10,000 test cases, showing stable failure patterns despite occasional instability. Statistical analysis indicated that code churn and kernel changes had minor overall effects on failure rates.

Conclusion: Findings suggest longitudinal consistency and stability in automated, evolving software test frameworks. This helps understand the dynamics of large-scale test suites and informs future development.

Abstract: The paper presents a longitudinal empirical analysis of the automated,
continuous, and virtualization-based software test suite of the NetBSD
operating system. The longitudinal period observed spans from the initial roll
out of the test suite in the early 2010s to late 2025. According to the
results, the test suite has grown continuously, currently covering over ten
thousand individual test cases. Failed test cases exhibit overall stability,
although there have been shorter periods marked with more frequent failures. A
similar observation applies to build failures, failures of the test suite to
complete, and installation failures, all of which are also captured by the
NetBSD's testing framework. Finally, code churn and kernel modifications do not
provide longitudinally consistent statistical explanations for the failures.
Although some periods exhibit larger effects, including particularly with
respect to the kernel modifications, the effects are small on average. Even
though only in an exploratory manner, these empirical observations contribute
to efforts to draw conclusions from large-scale and evolving software test
suites.

*Zihan Fang,Yifan Zhang,Yueke Zhang,Kevin Leach,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPO-f+, a framework to enhance feedback alignment in LLM-assisted code repair, demonstrating improved accuracy and alignment over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration in code repair tasks by addressing the difficulty developers face in interpreting language model outputs and optimizing feedback alignment with developer needs.

Method: The paper presents DPO-f+, which formalizes developer-specific metrics, builds datasets with pairwise preferences, fine-tunes using Direct Preference Optimization with a margin signal, and introduces an automated feedback evaluation protocol.

Result: DPO-f+ outperforms baselines and standard DPO, achieving better feedback alignment and higher performance in code-repair tasks, including a 5.71 percentage point improvement in novice task performance and a 4.67 percentage point improvement in SWE-bench Lite issues over the baseline.

Conclusion: DPO-f+ enhances the collaborative workflow of LLM-assisted code repair by aligning feedback with developer requirements, leading to improved code comprehension and human-AI teamwork in software engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
tasks, especially code repair. However, developers often struggle to interpret
model outputs, limiting effective human-AI teaming. Prior work largely
optimizes repaired code while under-addressing the natural-language feedback
that enables comprehension and iterative improvement. We present DPO-f+, a
novel framework that aligns code-repair feedback with developer needs and
profiles. It (1) formalizes developer-profiled, domain-specific metrics for
feedback alignment; (2) automatically constructs pairwise preference datasets
from code-repair tasks; (3) fine-tunes using Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) augmented with a lightweight margin signal; and (4) provides an automated
feedback evaluation protocol. Empirically, DPO-f+ outperforms both the baseline
and standard DPO on generated-code accuracy and overall feedback alignment. On
novice programming tasks, DPO-f+ raises the top-1 pass rate by 5.71 percentage
points (pp) over the baseline and by 3.30 pp over DPO. On the more challenging
SWE-bench Lite benchmark, it increases the issue-resolution rate by 1.67 pp
over DPO and by 4.67 pp over the baseline. It also achieves the largest
improvement in feedback alignment, outperforming DPO and the baseline. By
aligning feedback more closely with developer needs, DPO-f+ turns LLM-assisted
repair from one-shot outputs into a collaborative sensemaking workflow,
providing a practical approach to enhancing code comprehension and fostering
more effective human-AI teaming in software engineering.

### [406] [HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01047)
*Yu Shi,Hao Li,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAFixAgent, a history-aware automated program repair system that significantly improves bug repair by utilizing repository history during repair processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitation of current automated program repair systems, which often neglect repository history, despite evidence showing its potential for improving bug fixing efficiency, particularly for complex bugs.

Method: The authors designed HAFixAgent, which incorporates blame-derived repository heuristics to leverage relevant historical context from version control systems during the repair process.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HAFixAgent outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a significant effectiveness improvement (212.3% over agent-based and 29.9% over multi-hunk baselines) without significantly increasing computational costs.

Conclusion: Integrating repository history into agentic APR systems can enhance both effectiveness and practicality for repairing complex bugs, presenting a cost-efficient approach for improving bug-fixing agents.

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language
models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot
context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository
history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy
line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether
repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially
for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing
Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A
preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our
design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly
concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art
baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the
agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2)
Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token
costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex
multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical
heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off.
HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the
agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and

### [407] [HarnessLLM: Automatic Testing Harness Generation via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01104)
*Yujian Liu,Jiabao Ji,Yang Zhang,Wenbo Guo,Tommi Jaakkola,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HarnessLLM introduces a two-stage training pipeline for Large Language Models (LLMs) that focuses on writing harness code for test generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based test generation methods lack diversity and sufficient debugging information in the generated tests.

Method: HarnessLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline. LLMs are trained using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Validation Reward (RLVR) to generate harness code capable of synthesizing inputs and validating outputs.

Result: HarnessLLM surpasses input-output-based testing approaches in identifying bugs and diversifying testing strategies, while also improving code generation performance during inference.

Conclusion: HarnessLLM proves to be a more effective and flexible approach for automated test generation, enhancing both bug finding and the diversity of test cases, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based automatic test generation methods mainly produce input and
expected output pairs to categorize the intended behavior of correct programs.
Although straightforward, these methods have limited diversity in generated
tests and cannot provide enough debugging information. We propose HarnessLLM, a
two-stage training pipeline that enables LLMs to write harness code for
testing. Particularly, LLMs generate code that synthesizes inputs and validates
the observed outputs, allowing complex test cases and flexible output
validation such as invariant checking. To achieve this, we train LLMs with SFT
followed by RLVR with a customized reward design. Experiments show that
HarnessLLM outperforms input-output-based testing in bug finding and testing
strategy diversity. HarnessLLM further benefits the code generation performance
through test-time scaling with our generated test cases as inference-phase
validation. Our code is available at

*Wenqing Zhu,Norihiro Yoshida,Eunjong Choi,Yutaka Matsubara,Hiroaki Takada*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models' (LLMs) performance and consistency in code clone detection using seven datasets from CodeNet and BigCloneBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze LLMs' cross-dataset performance and response consistency in code clone detection tasks.

Method: Created seven datasets using Levenshtein ratio from CodeNet and BigCloneBench collections, tested five LLMs with four prompts, and assessed performance metrics.

Result: LLMs performed well on CodeNet datasets (F1 score of 0.943 with o3-mini), but struggled on BigCloneBench datasets; consistency in responses was high (over 90%) with minimal F1 score variations.

Conclusion: LLMs show good potential for code clone detection, but their cross-dataset performance variability highlights the need for further improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various software engineering tasks, such as code generation and debugging,
because of their ability to translate between programming languages and natural
languages. Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in code
clone detection. However, two crucial issues remain unaddressed: the ability of
LLMs to achieve comparable performance across different datasets and the
consistency of LLMs' responses in code clone detection. To address these
issues, we constructed seven code clone datasets and then evaluated five LLMs
in four existing prompts with these datasets. The datasets were created by
sampling code pairs using their Levenshtein ratio from two different code
collections, CodeNet and BigCloneBench. Our evaluation revealed that although
LLMs perform well in CodeNet-related datasets, with o3-mini achieving a 0.943
F1 score, their performance significantly decreased in BigCloneBench-related
datasets. Most models achieved a high response consistency, with over 90\% of
judgments remaining consistent across all five submissions. The fluctuations of
the F1 score affected by inconsistency are also tiny; their variations are less
than 0.03.

### [409] [Lares: LLM-driven Code Slice Semantic Search for Patch Presence Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01252)
*Siyuan Li,Yaowen Zheng,Hong Li,Jingdong Guo,Chaopeng Dong,Chunpeng Yan,Weijie Wang,Yimo Ren,Limin Sun,Hongsong Zhu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lares, a system that enhances security by identifying patches in binaries using Code Slice Semantic Search, bypassing dependency on compilation processes and improving accuracy and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of identifying patched vulnerabilities in software binaries, including reliance on compilation processes and inaccuracy in distinguishing patch-related code changes from compilation variations.

Method: Lares uses Code Slice Semantic Search to extract features directly from patch source code and identify semantically equivalent code slices in target binary pseudocode. It employs LLMs for code analysis and SMT solvers for logical reasoning.

Result: Lares demonstrates superior precision, recall, and usability in detecting patch presence. It is evaluated across varying optimization levels, architectures, and compilers.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Lares is an effective, scalable, and accurate solution for patch presence testing, overcoming limitations of previous methods and advancing the field with its comprehensive evaluation approach.

Abstract: In modern software ecosystems, 1-day vulnerabilities pose significant
security risks due to extensive code reuse. Identifying vulnerable functions in
target binaries alone is insufficient; it is also crucial to determine whether
these functions have been patched. Existing methods, however, suffer from
limited usability and accuracy. They often depend on the compilation process to
extract features, requiring substantial manual effort and failing for certain
software. Moreover, they cannot reliably differentiate between code changes
caused by patches or compilation variations. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lares, a scalable and accurate method for patch presence testing. Lares
introduces Code Slice Semantic Search, which directly extracts features from
the patch source code and identifies semantically equivalent code slices in the
pseudocode of the target binary. By eliminating the need for the compilation
process, Lares improves usability, while leveraging large language models
(LLMs) for code analysis and SMT solvers for logical reasoning to enhance
accuracy. Experimental results show that Lares achieves superior precision,
recall, and usability. Furthermore, it is the first work to evaluate patch
presence testing across optimization levels, architectures, and compilers. The

*Chong Wang,Chen Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Wunan Guo,Jianfeng Qu,Yewen Tian,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates LLM-based CI configuration translation from Travis CI to GitHub Actions, highlighting challenges and improvements with iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in CI configuration migration, leveraging LLMs to bridge gaps caused by complex semantic differences between CI platforms.

Method: The authors quantify migration efforts, analyze LLM-generated translations for errors, and evaluate enhancement strategies like guideline-based prompting and iterative refinement.

Result: Developers navigate significant CI migration efforts, LLM translations exhibit various errors, and combining guideline-based prompts with iterative refinement significantly improves translation success.

Conclusion: Refined LLM strategies improve CI migration accuracy, reducing developer burdens and advancing configuration translation approaches.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) is a cornerstone of modern collaborative software
development, and numerous CI platforms are available. Differences in
maintenance overhead, reliability, and integration depth with code-hosting
platforms make migration between CI platforms a common practice. A central step
in migration is translating CI configurations, which is challenging due to the
intrinsic complexity of CI configurations and the need to understand semantic
differences and relationships across CI platforms.
  With the advent of large language models (LLMs), recent advances in software
engineering highlight their potential for CI configuration translation. In this
paper, we present a study on LLM-based CI configuration translation, focusing
on the migration from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. First, using 811 migration
records, we quantify the effort involved and find that developers read an
average of 38 lines of Travis configuration and write 58 lines of GitHub
Actions configuration, with nearly half of the migrations requiring multiple
commits. We further analyze translations produced by each of the four LLMs and
identify 1,121 issues grouped into four categories: logic inconsistencies
(38%), platform discrepancies (32%), environment errors (25%), and syntax
errors (5%). Finally, we evaluate three enhancement strategies and show that
combining guideline-based prompting with iterative refinement achieves the best
performance, reaching a Build Success Rate of 75.5%-nearly a threefold
improvement over GPT-4o with a basic prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI is being used in Requirements Engineering (RE) and analyze its benefits, challenges, and current adoption trends in software engineering.

Method: The researchers surveyed 55 software practitioners to map AI usage across RE phases and decision-making approaches, gathering data on perceptions, challenges, and opportunities.

Result: 58.2% of respondents use AI in RE, with 69.1% finding its impact positive. HAIC is prevalent in practice, used in 54.4% of RE techniques, whereas full AI automation is minimal at 5.4%. Passive AI validation is even less common.

Conclusion: AI is most effective in RE as a collaborative partner (HAIC) rather than a human replacement. There is a need for frameworks and responsible AI governance to scale adoption effectively.

Abstract: The integration of AI for Requirements Engineering (RE) presents significant
benefits but also poses real challenges.Although RE is fundamental to software
engineering, limited research has examined AI adoption in RE.We surveyed 55
software practitioners to map AI usage across four RE phases:Elicitation,
Analysis, Specification, and Validation, and four approaches for decision
making: human only decisions, AI validation, Human AI Collaboration (HAIC), and
full AI automation.Participants also shared their perceptions, challenges, and
opportunities when applying AI for RE tasks.Our data show that 58.2% of
respondents already use AI in RE, and 69.1% view its impact as positive or very
positive.HAIC dominates practice, accounting for 54.4% of all RE techniques,
while full AI automation remains minimal at 5.4%.Passive AI validation (4.4 to
6.2%) lags even further behind, indicating that practitioners value AI's active
support over passive oversight.These findings suggest that AI is most effective
when positioned as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human
expertise.It also highlights the need for RE specific HAIC frameworks along
with robust and responsible AI governance as AI adoption in RE grows.

advancing AI integration across all SDLC phases. It focuses on GenAI's
potential, the development of innovative tools, and emerging research
challenges, actively shaping the future of software engineering. This vision
paper presents a shared perspective on the future of GenAI-based software
engineering, grounded in cross-sector dialogue and experience within the GENIUS
consortium, supported by an exploratory literature review. The paper explores
four central elements: (1) a structured overview of current challenges in GenAI
adoption across the SDLC; (2) a forward-looking vision outlining key
technological and methodological advances expected over the next five years;
(3) anticipated shifts in the roles and required skill sets of software
professionals; and (4) the contribution of GENIUS in realizing this
transformation through practical tools and industrial validation. By aligning
technical innovation with business relevance, this paper aims to inform both

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in the software build process by developing a taxonomy of attack vectors. It is based on extensive CVE mining and analysis of supply chain attacks, emphasizing build-related security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical security challenges and gaps in understanding vulnerabilities specifically targeting the software build process, which is a vital stage in software development.

Method: The authors created a taxonomy of build-specific attack vectors by mining 621 CVEs from the NVD database. They validated their findings by analyzing 168 software supply chain attacks, isolating incidents targeting the build phase.

Result: Their analysis shows that 23.8% of supply chain attacks exploit build-related vulnerabilities, with dependency confusion and build script injection named as the most common vectors.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for focused security measures against build process vulnerabilities and provides a dataset for further research in this domain.

Abstract: The software build process transforms source code into deployable artifacts,
representing a critical yet vulnerable stage in software development. Build
infrastructure security poses unique challenges: the complexity of
multi-component systems (source code, dependencies, build tools), the
difficulty of detecting intrusions during compilation, and prevalent build
non-determinism that masks malicious modifications. Despite these risks, the
security community lacks a systematic understanding of build-specific attack
vectors, hindering effective defense design.
  This paper presents an empirically-derived taxonomy of attack vectors
targeting the build process, constructed through a large-scale CVE mining (of
621 vulnerability disclosures from the NVD database). We categorize attack
vectors by their injection points across the build pipeline, from source code
manipulation to compiler compromise. To validate our taxonomy, we analyzed 168
documented software supply chain attacks, identifying 40 incidents specifically
targeting build phases. Our analysis reveals that 23.8\% of supply chain
attacks exploit build vulnerabilities, with dependency confusion and build
script injection representing the most prevalent vectors.

### [414] [VeriODD: From YAML to SMT-LIB - Automating Verification of Operational Design Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01417)
*Bassel Rafie,Christian Schindler,Andreas Rausch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VeriODD is a tool for translating YAML-based ODD/COD specifications into solver-ready SMT-LIB and human-readable logic for automated verification in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of automating the verification of Operational Design Domains (ODDs) and Current Operational Domains (CODs) specifications, which are often expressed in YAML and not directly compatible with formal verification systems.

Method: The tool, VeriODD, uses ANTLR-based compiler technology to transform YAML specifications into both propositional logic and SMT-LIB, enabling integration with SMT solvers for automated consistency checks and verification. A graphical user interface further supports the ease of use.

Result: VeriODD bridges the gap between YAML-based stakeholder-friendly descriptions and their solver-ready counterparts, enabling scalable, efficient verification of operational boundaries in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: The tool promotes automated safety assurance in autonomous driving by providing an efficient framework for verifying ODD/COD specifications, ensuring runtime safety compliance effectively.

Abstract: Operational Design Domains (ODDs) define the conditions under which an
Automated Driving System (ADS) is allowed to operate, while Current Operational
Domains (CODs) capture the actual runtime situation. Ensuring that a COD
instance lies within the ODD is a crucial step in safety assurance. Today, ODD
and COD specifications are frequently expressed in YAML to remain accessible
for stakeholders, but such descriptions are not directly suitable for
solver-based verification. Manual translation into formal languages such as
SMT-LIB is slow and error-prone. We present VeriODD, a tool that automates this
translation. VeriODD uses ANTLR-based compiler technology to transform
YAML-based ODD/COD specifications into both human-readable propositional logic,
for lightweight review on a simple basis, and solver-ready SMT-LIB. The tool
integrates with SMT solvers such as Z3 to provide automated consistency checks
of ODD specifications and verification of COD conformance. A graphical user
interface supports editing specifications, inspecting generated formulas, and
performing verification with a single click. VeriODD thereby closes the gap
between stakeholder-friendly ODD/COD notations and formal verification,
enabling scalable and automated assurance of operational boundaries in
autonomous driving. Video demonstration: https://youtu.be/odRacNoL_Pk Tool

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of ensuring semantic correctness in high-definition map transformations and overcoming scalability limitations of rule-based frameworks.

Method: The paper introduces a pipeline leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate grammar-compliant rules and predicates that integrate into a computational First-Order Logic framework.

Result: The prototype implementation successfully reduced manual engineering effort while maintaining correctness in evaluating synthetic bridge and slope scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, semi-automated human-in-the-loop verification for map transformations, enhancing interoperability and reducing reliance on manual methods.

Abstract: High-definition map transformations are essential in autonomous driving
systems, enabling interoperability across tools. Ensuring their semantic
correctness is challenging, since existing rule-based frameworks rely on
manually written formulas and domain-specific functions, limiting scalability.
  In this paper, We present an LLM-assisted pipeline that jointly generates
logical formulas and corresponding executable predicates within a computational
FOL framework, extending the map verifier in CommonRoad scenario designer with
elevation support. The pipeline leverages prompt-based LLM generation to
produce grammar-compliant rules and predicates that integrate directly into the
existing system.
  We implemented a prototype and evaluated it on synthetic bridge and slope
scenarios. The results indicate reduced manual engineering effort while
preserving correctness, demonstrating the feasibility of a scalable,
semi-automated human-in-the-loop approach to map-transformation verification.

*Ronivaldo Ferreira,Guilherme da Silva,Carla Rocha,Gustavo Pinto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the challenges of deploying machine learning in government digital platforms, emphasizing the need for institutional data governance and civic infrastructure to ensure transparency and accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties and constraints faced while implementing machine learning in government systems, including technical challenges (e.g., class imbalance, data drift) and organizational barriers (e.g., data access, governance).

Method: A case study of the Brasil Participativo platform, analyzing the use of techniques like LLMs for pre-labeling, routed models, and synthetic data generation to understand the implications on traceability, reliability, and costs.

Result: The paper finds that without disciplined data governance and human validation, common engineering choices can introduce risks. It highlights that ML in the public sector must balance technical and institutional challenges.

Conclusion: The success of ML in government will depend on creating transparent, reproducible, and accountable data infrastructures rather than solely focusing on advancing model accuracy. ML pipelines should be treated as civic infrastructure to build citizen trust.

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly being embedded into government digital
platforms, but public-sector constraints make it difficult to build ML systems
that are accurate, auditable, and operationally sustainable. In practice, teams
face not only technical issues like extreme class imbalance and data drift, but
also organizational barriers such as bureaucratic data access, lack of
versioned datasets, and incomplete governance over provenance and monitoring.
Our study of the Brasil Participativo (BP) platform shows that common
engineering choices -- like using LLMs for pre-labeling, splitting models into
routed classifiers, and generating synthetic data -- can speed development but
also introduce new traceability, reliability, and cost risks if not paired with
disciplined data governance and human validation. This means that, in the
public sector, responsible ML is not just a modeling problem but an
institutional engineering problem, and ML pipelines must be treated as civic
infrastructure. Ultimately, this study shows that the success of machine
learning in the public sector will depend less on breakthroughs in model
accuracy and more on the ability of institutions to engineer transparent,
reproducible, and accountable data infrastructures that citizens can trust.

*Shamse Tasnim Cynthia,Banani Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel task-aware, two-stage retrieval framework combining dense vector search and large language model-based reranking to improve workflow retrieval in Galaxy, a bioinformatics workflow management system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galaxy’s current keyword-based search system struggles to retrieve relevant workflows when exact term matches are absent, necessitating an improved, semantically aware retrieval method to enhance usability for a broader user base.

Method: The proposed system performs a two-stage process: first using embedding models for initial workflow retrieval via dense vector search, followed by instruction-tuned large language models (GPT-4o, Mistral-7B) for task-aligned reranking. Additionally, the authors curated a benchmark dataset and employed LLMs for query generation.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of top-k accuracy and relevance, particularly for complex or under-specified user queries, demonstrated through systematic IR metric evaluations.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the search and discovery of workflows in Galaxy, boosting accessibility and usability for scientists, especially novices and interdisciplinary researchers. It highlights the potential of LLMs in scientific tool integration.

Abstract: Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) such as Galaxy have become
essential infrastructure in bioinformatics, supporting the design, execution,
and sharing of complex multi-step analyses. Despite hosting hundreds of
reusable workflows across domains, Galaxy's current keyword-based retrieval
system offers limited support for semantic query interpretation and often fails
to surface relevant workflows when exact term matches are absent. To address
this gap, we propose a task-aware, two-stage retrieval framework that
integrates dense vector search with large language model (LLM)-based reranking.
Our system first retrieves candidate workflows using state-of-the-art embedding
models and then reranks them using instruction-tuned generative LLMs (GPT-4o,
Mistral-7B) based on semantic task alignment. To support robust evaluation, we
construct a benchmark dataset of Galaxy workflows annotated with semantic
topics via BERTopic and synthesize realistic task-oriented queries using LLMs.
We conduct a comprehensive comparison of lexical, dense, and reranking models
using standard IR metrics, presenting the first systematic evaluation of
retrieval performance in the Galaxy ecosystem. Results show that our approach
significantly improves top-k accuracy and relevance, particularly for long or
under-specified queries. We further integrate our system as a prototype tool
within Galaxy, providing a proof-of-concept for LLM-enhanced workflow search.
This work advances the usability and accessibility of scientific workflows,
especially for novice users and interdisciplinary researchers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes ICL4Decomp, a hybrid framework using in-context learning to guide large language models in generating re-executable source code from binary, improving on existing decompilation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decompilation methods often fail to produce re-executable code, especially for optimized binaries due to lost semantic cues and compiler optimizations.

Method: The framework incorporates in-context learning (ICL) into large language models to enhance their ability to recover contextual semantic cues and produce executable source code.

Result: ICL4Decomp achieves about 40% improvement in code re-executability over state-of-the-art decompilation techniques across varied datasets, optimization levels, and compilers.

Conclusion: ICL4Decomp offers a robust and effective solution to the limitations of traditional and neural decompilation methods, advancing the generation of re-executable code from binaries.

Abstract: Binary decompilation plays an important role in software security analysis,
reverse engineering, and malware understanding when source code is unavailable.
However, existing decompilation techniques often fail to produce source code
that can be successfully recompiled and re-executed, particularly for optimized
binaries. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled neural
approaches to decompilation, but the generated code is typically only
semantically plausible rather than truly executable, limiting their practical
reliability. These shortcomings arise from compiler optimizations and the loss
of semantic cues in compiled code, which LLMs struggle to recover without
contextual guidance. To address this challenge, we propose ICL4Decomp, a hybrid
decompilation framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) to guide LLMs
toward generating re-executable source code. We evaluate our method across
multiple datasets, optimization levels, and compilers, demonstrating around
40\% improvement in re-executability over state-of-the-art decompilation
methods while maintaining robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for integrated environments supporting the complete ML lifecycle has increased due to limitations in traditional IDEs and MLOps platforms.

Method: The system combines a Large Language Model assistant with backend automation for data validation, drift detection, retraining, and deployment, implemented in the prototype SmartMLOps Studio.

Result: SmartMLOps Studio reduced pipeline configuration time by 61%, improved experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increased drift detection accuracy by 14%.

Conclusion: The research introduces an innovative IDE paradigm, integrating intelligent code assistance and automated pipelines for AI engineering efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML)
applications has intensified the demand for integrated environments that unify
model development, deployment, and monitoring. Traditional Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking
intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms
remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study
proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines
that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single
environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant
capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline
configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature
storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment
orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps
Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI
Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio
reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility
by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional
workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational
pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering -
transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware
intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to advance methods for remote screening and monitoring cognitive aging via mobile devices.

Method: Participants underwent psychological tests measuring cognitive functions, with test results processed to train a machine learning regression model to predict cognitive age.

Result: Key test metrics were calculated, processed, and utilized to successfully train a regression model for cognitive age prediction.

Conclusion: The method facilitates cognitive aging diagnosis and monitoring and contributes to remote health screening advancements.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for predicting cognitive age using
psychophysiological tests. To determine cognitive age, subjects were asked to
complete a series of psychological tests measuring various cognitive functions,
including reaction time and cognitive conflict, short-term memory, verbal
functions, and color and spatial perception. Based on the tests completed, the
average completion time, proportion of correct answers, average absolute delta
of the color campimetry test, number of guessed words in the M\"unsterberg
matrix, and other parameters were calculated for each subject. The obtained
characteristics of the subjects were preprocessed and used to train a machine
learning algorithm implementing a regression task for predicting a person's
cognitive age. These findings contribute to the field of remote screening using
mobile devices for human health for diagnosing and monitoring cognitive aging.

(vRSA) for electromagnetic recordings of neural responses (e.g., EEG, MEG, ECoG
or LFP). Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the
similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or
multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in
the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data
covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby
casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context,
peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to
test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in
data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model
estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over
classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing,
quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and
computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked
example using openly available EEG data. Software functions implementing vRSA
for the SPM software package accompany this paper, together with exemplar
analysis scripts.

### [422] [Gradient Boosted Mixed Models: Flexible Joint Estimation of Mean and Variance Components for Clustered Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00217)
*Mitchell L. Prevett,Francis K. C. Hui,Zhi Yang Tho,A. H. Welsh,Anton H. Westveld*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gradient Boosted Mixed Models (GBMixed), combining gradient boosting and mixed model approaches for high predictive accuracy and advanced uncertainty quantification in clustered data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear mixed models have limited flexibility for complex and high-dimensional data due to parametric constraints, while gradient boosting lacks support for clustered data structures and uncertainty quantification.

Method: The proposed method integrates boosting with likelihood-based gradients for simultaneous estimation of mean and variance components, using regression trees or splines to allow flexible and interpretable nonparametric modeling.

Result: Simulations and real-world applications show GBMixed achieves high predictive accuracy, accurate recovery of variance components, and reliable uncertainty measures outperforming standard methods.

Conclusion: GBMixed extends boosting to clustered data, enabling covariate-dependent predictions and providing tools for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects with robust uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Linear mixed models are widely used for clustered data, but their reliance on
parametric forms limits flexibility in complex and high-dimensional settings.
In contrast, gradient boosting methods achieve high predictive accuracy through
nonparametric estimation, but do not accommodate clustered data structures or
provide uncertainty quantification.
  We introduce Gradient Boosted Mixed Models (GBMixed), a framework and
algorithm that extends boosting to jointly estimate mean and variance
components via likelihood-based gradients. In addition to nonparametric mean
estimation, the method models both random effects and residual variances as
potentially covariate-dependent functions using flexible base learners such as
regression trees or splines, enabling nonparametric estimation while
maintaining interpretability.
  Simulations and real-world applications demonstrate accurate recovery of
variance components, calibrated prediction intervals, and improved predictive
accuracy relative to standard linear mixed models and nonparametric methods.
GBMixed provides heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification and introduces
boosting for heterogeneous random effects. This enables covariate-dependent
shrinkage for cluster-specific predictions to adapt between population and
cluster-level data. Under standard causal assumptions, the framework enables
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with reliable uncertainty
quantification.

### [423] [A Streaming Sparse Cholesky Method for Derivative-Informed Gaussian Process Surrogates Within Digital Twin Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00366)
*Krishna Prasath Logakannan,Shridhar Vashishtha,Jacob Hochhalter,Shandian Zhe,Robert M. Kirby*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved digital twin (DT) framework to more accurately model physical assets using a derivative-enhanced sparse Gaussian Process (GP), solving challenges of computational costs while ensuring dynamic updates with real-time service data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of creating accurate and computationally feasible digital twin models for physical systems, capable of being dynamically updated using service data for real-time forecasting.

Method: The study extends Gaussian Process models to include derivative data for better accuracy and employs a sparse GP approximation to manage the computational costs arising from increased covariance matrix dimensions. The model is dynamically updated with in-service data.

Result: The derivative-enhanced sparse GP method demonstrated improved prediction accuracy in numerical experiments and dynamically enhanced models upon the addition of service data.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves digital twin effectiveness, particularly for real-time applications like fatigue crack growth modeling in aerospace vehicles, by combining derivative-enhanced GP and sparse approximations.

Abstract: Digital twins are developed to model the behavior of a specific physical
asset (or twin), and they can consist of high-fidelity physics-based models or
surrogates. A highly accurate surrogate is often preferred over multi-physics
models as they enable forecasting the physical twin future state in real-time.
To adapt to a specific physical twin, the digital twin model must be updated
using in-service data from that physical twin. Here, we extend Gaussian process
(GP) models to include derivative data, for improved accuracy, with dynamic
updating to ingest physical twin data during service. Including derivative
data, however, comes at a prohibitive cost of increased covariance matrix
dimension. We circumvent this issue by using a sparse GP approximation, for
which we develop extensions to incorporate derivatives. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the derivative-enhanced sparse GP
method produces improved models upon dynamic data additions. Lastly, we apply
the developed algorithm within a DT framework to model fatigue crack growth in
an aerospace vehicle.

*Gero Junike,Marco Oesting*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes using extreme value theory to analyze and quantify the large errors of neural networks, introducing a new estimator for the shape parameter of the error distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a technique to quantify the error of neural networks in approximating functions, especially the large errors relevant in practical applications.

Method: Extreme Value Theory is applied to model the error distribution of neural networks beyond a certain threshold as generalized Pareto distributed, along with the development of a new shape parameter estimator.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate the suitability of the proposed estimator for describing the error distribution in neural networks.

Conclusion: Applying extreme value theory improves the ability to quantify significant error values in neural networks, with a new estimator enhancing this quantification.

Abstract: Neural networks are able to approximate any continuous function on a compact
set. However, it is not obvious how to quantify the error of the neural
network, i.e., the remaining bias between the function and the neural network.
Here, we propose the application of extreme value theory to quantify large
values of the error, which are typically relevant in applications. The
distribution of the error beyond some threshold is approximately generalized
Pareto distributed. We provide a new estimator of the shape parameter of the
Pareto distribution suitable to describe the error of neural networks.
Numerical experiments are provided.

*Haoting Zhang,Haoxian Chen,Donglin Zhan,Hanyang Zhao,Henry Lam,Wenpin Tang,David Yao,Zeyu Zheng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: SOCRATES leverages large language models (LLMs) to create effective and adaptive simulation optimization algorithms for complex stochastic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and automated framework for optimizing complex and expensive stochastic systems by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage procedure, SOCRATES. In the first stage, LLMs create a structural skeleton and guide the learning of replicas of the system. In the second stage, these replicas are used to evaluate SO algorithms, and an LLM serves as a meta-optimizer to design a tailored and adaptive optimization schedule.

Result: SOCRATES provides a novel approach that combines LLM-driven reasoning and trajectory-aware optimization, leading to a more sample-efficient and effective solution for simulation optimization.

Conclusion: SOCRATES represents a significant step forward in simulation optimization by integrating advanced LLM capabilities, enabling automation, adaptability, and improved optimization outcomes.

Abstract: The field of simulation optimization (SO) encompasses various methods
developed to optimize complex, expensive-to-sample stochastic systems.
Established methods include, but are not limited to, ranking-and-selection for
finite alternatives and surrogate-based methods for continuous domains, with
broad applications in engineering and operations management. The recent advent
of large language models (LLMs) offers a new paradigm for exploiting system
structure and automating the strategic selection and composition of these
established SO methods into a tailored optimization procedure. This work
introduces SOCRATES (Simulation Optimization with Correlated Replicas and
Adaptive Trajectory Evaluations), a novel two-stage procedure that leverages
LLMs to automate the design of tailored SO algorithms. The first stage
constructs an ensemble of digital replicas of the real system. An LLM is
employed to implement causal discovery from a textual description of the
system, generating a structural `skeleton' that guides the sample-efficient
learning of the replicas. In the second stage, this replica ensemble is used as
an inexpensive testbed to evaluate a set of baseline SO algorithms. An LLM then
acts as a meta-optimizer, analyzing the performance trajectories of these
algorithms to iteratively revise and compose a final, hybrid optimization
schedule. This schedule is designed to be adaptive, with the ability to be
updated during the final execution on the real system when the optimization
performance deviates from expectations. By integrating LLM-driven reasoning
with LLM-assisted trajectory-aware meta-optimization, SOCRATES creates an
effective and sample-efficient solution for complex SO optimization problems.

*Zhexiao Huang,Weihao He,Shutao Deng,Junzhe Chen,Chao Yuan,Hongxin Wang,Changsheng Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: P-OCS method enhances OOD detection using perturbations in an orthogonal complement subspace, offering efficiency and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for effective OOD detection in open-world environments while minimizing computational cost and avoiding challenges like model retraining.

Method: The proposed P-OCS method uses well-defined perturbations in an orthogonal complement subspace to distinguish OOD samples from ID samples without modifying the model architecture or accessing OOD data.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several architectures and datasets with very low computational overhead.

Conclusion: P-OCS is a straightforward, efficient approach to OOD detection, requiring only minimal computational effort and no modifications or external data, making it valuable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for deploying deep learning
models in open-world environments. Existing approaches, such as energy-based
scoring and gradient-projection methods, typically rely on high-dimensional
representations to separate in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. We introduce
P-OCS (Perturbations in the Orthogonal Complement Subspace), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded method that operates in the orthogonal complement of the
principal subspace defined by ID features. P-OCS applies a single projected
perturbation restricted to this complementary subspace, enhancing subtle ID-OOD
distinctions while preserving the geometry of ID representations. We show that
a one-step update is sufficient in the small-perturbation regime and provide
convergence guarantees for the resulting detection score. Experiments across
multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that P-OCS achieves
state-of-the-art OOD detection with negligible computational cost and without
requiring model retraining, access to OOD data, or changes to model
architecture.

### [427] [Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01037)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the statistical-computational gap in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) using a parametric method known as fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT). Key findings include a convergence in constraint density estimates and implications for algorithmic thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the statistical-computational gap in ABP, particularly focusing on two thresholds: the satisfiability threshold and algorithmic threshold.

Method: The study utilizes the fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) to analyze ABP. It examines the progression of a parametric key component, the "c sequence," across different lifting levels.

Result: Critical constraints density decreases as the fl RDT lifting level progresses, and satisfactory convergence is observed by the fifth level. Numerical estimates align with difficulty points for locally improving algorithms and match interpretations from other theoretical models.

Conclusion: The results contribute to the understanding of ABP's storage memory efficiency and algorithmic thresholds. They align well with prior theoretical observations, potentially aiding efficient algorithm design for similar problems.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely
exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the
appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds:
\textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above
which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and
\textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which
one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a
storage memory.
  We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random
duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic
implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one
progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the
so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the
(natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is
then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the
second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density
$\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels
decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory
level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two
striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density
estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of
clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally
improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of
$\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield
model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach
similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].

### [428] [Generalized Guarantees for Variational Inference in the Presence of Even and Elliptical Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01064)
*Charles C. Margossian,Lawrence K. Saul*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper extends symmetry-based guarantees for variational inference (VI), providing broader divergence family compatibility and handling partial symmetries in hierarchical models for better approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent VI results ensure recovery of target density properties using reverse KL divergence under symmetry assumptions; this paper seeks to extend these results to broader divergences and more general symmetry scenarios.

Method: Theoretical enhancements are made to guarantees of VI performance under broader divergence functions and partial symmetric properties, supported by experimental illustrations.

Result: Improved theoretical results that expand VI’s applicability in recovering mean and correlation matrix from complex targets, including those with mixed symmetries.

Conclusion: The paper strengthens the theoretical basis of VI, demonstrating its extended capability to approximate target densities effectively even in challenging geometric or partial symmetry settings.

Abstract: We extend several recent results providing symmetry-based guarantees for
variational inference (VI) with location-scale families. VI approximates a
target density~$p$ by the best match $q^*$ in a family $Q$ of tractable
distributions that in general does not contain $p$. It is known that VI can
recover key properties of $p$, such as its mean and correlation matrix, when
$p$ and $Q$ exhibit certain symmetries and $q^*$ is found by minimizing the
reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence. We extend these guarantees in two
important directions. First, we provide symmetry-based guarantees for a broader
family of divergences, highlighting the properties of variational objectives
under which VI provably recovers the mean and correlation matrix. Second, we
obtain further guarantees for VI when the target density $p$ exhibits even and
elliptical symmetries in some but not all of its coordinates. These partial
symmetries arise naturally in Bayesian hierarchical models, where the prior
induces a challenging geometry but still possesses axes of symmetry. We
illustrate these theoretical results in a number of experimental settings.

### [429] [Hyper Hawkes Processes: Interpretable Models of Marked Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01096)
*Alex Boyd,Andrew Warrington,Taha Kass-Hout,Parminder Bhatia,Danica Xiao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hyper Hawkes Process (HHP), a new Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) model designed to be as flexible and accurate as neural MTPPs while retaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTPP models like the Hawkes process favor interpretability but lack flexibility, while neural MTPPs focus on better predictive performance at the cost of interpretability. The study aims to balance these two aspects and improve both expressivity and interpretability.

Method: The proposed HHP extends classical Hawkes processes by embedding event data into a latent space and using a hypernetwork to incorporate time- and data-dependent dynamics, retaining piecewise and conditional linearity.

Result: The HHP achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmark tasks and metrics in MTPP modeling, demonstrating enhanced flexibility and predictive power.

Conclusion: The HHP offers an innovative MTPP approach with remarkable predictive power and interpretability, combining the strengths of neural MTPPs and structured classical models like the Hawkes process.

Abstract: Foundational marked temporal point process (MTPP) models, such as the Hawkes
process, often use inexpressive model families in order to offer interpretable
parameterizations of event data. On the other hand, neural MTPPs models forego
this interpretability in favor of absolute predictive performance. In this
work, we present a new family MTPP models: the hyper Hawkes process (HHP),
which aims to be as flexible and performant as neural MTPPs, while retaining
interpretable aspects. To achieve this, the HHP extends the classical Hawkes
process to increase its expressivity by first expanding the dimension of the
process into a latent space, and then introducing a hypernetwork to allow time-
and data-dependent dynamics. These extensions define a highly performant MTPP
family, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmark
tasks and metrics. Furthermore, by retaining the linearity of the recurrence,
albeit now piecewise and conditionally linear, the HHP also retains much of the
structure of the original Hawkes process, which we exploit to create direct
probes into how the model creates predictions. HHP models therefore offer both
state-of-the-art predictions, while also providing an opportunity to ``open the
box'' and inspect how predictions were generated.

*Md Talha Mohsin,Ismail Abdulrashid*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Medical imaging often faces limited data availability and structural obstacles. This paper proposes a unified theoretical framework to address low-resource conditions, focusing on sample efficiency, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical imaging suffers from lack of accessible labeled datasets and issues like diagnostic uncertainty, biased decisions, and poor model robustness. Existing approaches lack theoretical justification in data-scarce conditions.

Method: The authors formalize few-shot learning objectives, compute sample complexity constraints, apply PAC-learning and PAC-Bayesian theory for multimodal integration, and propose a formal metric for explanation stability.

Result: The framework successfully quantifies uncertainty, supports multimodal generalization, and guarantees interpretability under low-data scenarios, providing a foundation for data-efficient diagnostics.

Conclusion: This unified framework creates principled methodologies for reliable medical image diagnostics in low-resource settings, emphasizing efficiency, accuracy, and explainability.

Abstract: Medical imaging relies heavily on large, labeled datasets. But,
unfortunately, they are not always easily accessible in clinical settings.
Additionally, many practitioners often face various structural obstacles like
limited data availability, fragmented data systems, and unbalanced datasets.
These barriers often lead to the increased diagnostic uncertainty,
underrepresentation of certain conditions, reduced model robustness, and biased
diagnostic decisions. In response to these challenges, approaches such as
transfer learning, meta-learning, and multimodal fusion have made great
strides. However, they still need a solid theoretical justification for why
they succeed or fail in situations where data is scarce. To address this gap,
we propose a unified theoretical framework that characterizes learning and
inference under low-resource medical imaging conditions. We first formalize the
learning objective under few-shot conditions and compute sample complexity
constraints to estimate the smallest quantity of data needed to achieve
clinically reliable accuracy. Then based on ideas from PAC-learning and
PAC-Bayesian theory, we explain how multimodal integration encourages
generalization and quantifies uncertainty under sparse supervision. We further
propose a formal metric for explanation stability, offering interpretability
guarantees under low-data conditions. Taken together, the proposed framework
establishes a principled foundation for constructing dependable, data-efficient
diagnostic systems by jointly characterizing sample efficiency, uncertainty
quantification, and interpretability in a unified theoretical setting.

TL;DR: The paper reviews missing data challenges in data science and synthesizes classical and modern imputation methods, focusing on integrations with downstream tasks and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmentation in missing data literature and provide a comprehensive synthesis that bridges statistical foundations with advances in machine learning.

Method: The authors reviewed concepts like missingness mechanisms and categorized imputation methods, spanning classical techniques to modern approaches like deep learning and large language models.

Result: The paper systematically categorizes methodologies, examines domain-specific challenges, and highlights theoretical guarantees, benchmarking, and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes critical challenges such as model selection, privacy-preserving imputation, and generalizable models, offering a roadmap for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Missing data is a fundamental challenge in data science, significantly
hindering analysis and decision-making across a wide range of disciplines,
including healthcare, bioinformatics, social science, e-commerce, and
industrial monitoring. Despite decades of research and numerous imputation
methods, the literature remains fragmented across fields, creating a critical
need for a comprehensive synthesis that connects statistical foundations with
modern machine learning advances. This work systematically reviews core
concepts-including missingness mechanisms, single versus multiple imputation,
and different imputation goals-and examines problem characteristics across
various domains. It provides a thorough categorization of imputation methods,
spanning classical techniques (e.g., regression, the EM algorithm) to modern
approaches like low-rank and high-rank matrix completion, deep learning models
(autoencoders, GANs, diffusion models, graph neural networks), and large
language models. Special attention is given to methods for complex data types,
such as tensors, time series, streaming data, graph-structured data,
categorical data, and multimodal data. Beyond methodology, we investigate the
crucial integration of imputation with downstream tasks like classification,
clustering, and anomaly detection, examining both sequential pipelines and
joint optimization frameworks. The review also assesses theoretical guarantees,
benchmarking resources, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify critical
challenges and future directions, emphasizing model selection and
hyperparameter optimization, the growing importance of privacy-preserving
imputation via federated learning, and the pursuit of generalizable models that
can adapt across domains and data types, thereby outlining a roadmap for future
research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of attention temperature in improving in-context learning (ICL) performance of pretrained transformers under distribution shifts, offering theoretical insights, simulations, and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained transformers struggle with ICL under distribution shift scenarios common in real-world deployments.

Method: Utilize linearized softmax framework to derive generalization error expressions, identify optimal attention temperature, and validate through simulations and large-scale experiments.

Result: Proven that optimal attention temperature mitigates errors caused by input covariance and label noise shifts, confirmed by experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA2-7B.

Conclusion: Attention temperature is a robust mechanism to enhance ICL performance in pretrained transformers under distribution shift, supported by theoretical foundations and experimental evidence.

Abstract: Pretrained Transformers excel at in-context learning (ICL), inferring new
tasks from only a handful of examples. Yet, their ICL performance can degrade
sharply under distribution shift between pretraining and test data, a regime
increasingly common in real-world deployments. While recent empirical work
hints that adjusting the attention temperature in the softmax can enhance
Transformer performance, the attention temperature's role in ICL under
distribution shift remains unexplored. This paper provides the first
theoretical and empirical study of attention temperature for ICL under
distribution shift. Using a simplified but expressive "linearized softmax"
framework, we derive closed-form generalization error expressions and prove
that shifts in input covariance or label noise substantially impair ICL, but
that an optimal attention temperature exists which minimizes this error. We
then validate our predictions through extensive simulations on linear
regression tasks and large-scale experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMA2-7B on
question-answering benchmarks. Our results establish attention temperature as a
principled and powerful mechanism for improving the robustness of ICL in
pretrained Transformers, advancing theoretical understanding and providing
actionable guidance for selecting attention temperature in practice.

TL;DR: The paper proposes three innovative architectures of Bayesian neural networks (PaTraC BNNs) for scalable and efficient uncertainty quantification in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian neural networks provide rigorous uncertainty quantification in deep learning but are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper introduces PaTraC BNNs that use trace-class neural network priors to reduce Bayesian parameters while maintaining uncertainty quantification capabilities.

Result: PaTraC BNNs demonstrate computational and statistical advantages, reducing memory and time requirements, verified through simulations and real-world dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: PaTraC BNNs enable reliable, scalable, and robust uncertainty quantification with fewer computational costs compared to traditional BNNs.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) allow rigorous uncertainty quantification in
deep learning, but often come at a prohibitive computational cost. We propose
three different innovative architectures of partial trace-class Bayesian neural
networks (PaTraC BNNs) that enable uncertainty quantification comparable to
standard BNNs but use significantly fewer Bayesian parameters. These PaTraC
BNNs have computational and statistical advantages over standard Bayesian
neural networks in terms of speed and memory requirements. Our proposed
methodology therefore facilitates reliable, robust, and scalable uncertainty
quantification in neural networks. The three architectures build on trace-class
neural network priors which induce an ordering of the neural network
parameters, and are thus a natural choice in our framework. In a numerical
simulation study, we verify the claimed benefits, and further illustrate the
performance of our proposed methodology on a real-world dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and explain learning rate transferability as neural networks scale in width under varying parameterizations.

Method: Use theoretical analysis under the $\mu$P parameterization and compare against SP and NTP to establish the behavior of learning rates in infinite-width scenarios.

Result: Show that $\mu$P enables optimal learning rate convergence to a non-zero constant, while alternative schemes fail. Empirical results reinforce theoretical proof.

Conclusion: $\mu$P provides a scalable and consistent learning rate parameterization that outperforms other schemes in infinite-width scenarios.

Abstract: We provide the first proof of learning rate transfer with width in a linear
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) parametrized with $\mu$P, a neural network
parameterization designed to ``maximize'' feature learning in the
infinite-width limit. We show that under $\mu P$, the optimal learning rate
converges to a \emph{non-zero constant} as width goes to infinity, providing a
theoretical explanation to learning rate transfer. In contrast, we show that
this property fails to hold under alternative parametrizations such as Standard
Parametrization (SP) and Neural Tangent Parametrization (NTP). We provide
intuitive proofs and support the theoretical findings with extensive empirical
results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trusted Intelligent NetChain (TINC), a novel multi-plane sharding architecture for consortium blockchains, addressing scalability and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome scalability and workload distribution issues in consortium blockchains while maintaining fairness and security.

Method: TINC employs adaptive node assignment, dynamic workload balancing, decoupling control/data planes, and integrates Dynamic Decentralized Identifiers (DDIDs).

Result: TINC achieves better throughput, latency, balanced distributions, and reduced transaction failures, while ensuring security and resilience.

Conclusion: TINC provides a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for consortium blockchains, outperforming existing shard-based architectures.

Abstract: Blockchain technology facilitates the development of decentralized systems
that ensure trust and transparency without the need for expensive centralized
intermediaries. However, existing blockchain architectures particularly
consortium blockchains face critical challenges related to scalability and
efficiency. State sharding has emerged as a promising approach to enhance
blockchain scalability and performance. However, current shard-based solutions
often struggle to guarantee fair participation and a balanced workload
distribution among consortium members. To address these limitations, we propose
Trusted Intelligent NetChain (TINC), a multi-plane sharding architecture
specifically designed for consortium blockchains. TINC incorporates intelligent
mechanisms for adaptive node assignment and dynamic workload balancing,
enabling the system to respond effectively to changing network conditions while
maintaining equitable shard utilization. By decoupling the control and data
planes, TINC allows control nodes to focus on consensus operations, while data
nodes handle large-scale storage, thus improving overall resource efficiency.
Extensive experimental evaluation and formal analysis demonstrate that TINC
significantly outperforms existing shard-based blockchain frameworks. It
achieves higher throughput, lower latency, balanced node and transaction
distributions, and reduced transaction failure rates. Furthermore, TINC
maintains essential blockchain security guarantees, exhibiting resilience
against Byzantine faults and dynamic network environments. The integration of
Dynamic Decentralized Identifiers (DDIDs) further strengthens trust and
security management within the consortium network.

Result: Prob-DDPG achieved the best cumulative rewards and interpretability of strategies, while reg-DDPG showed limited benefits, and hid-DDPG provided intermediate results with less interpretability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of embedding probabilistic insights into latent regimes to enhance the profitability and robustness of reinforcement learning-driven trading strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to financial problems has been the
subject of a lively area of research. The use of RL for optimal trading
strategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our
knowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading
problem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with
regime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information
from the trading signal with latent parameters.
  The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are
filtered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived
via RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
networks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step
approach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL
trader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of
posterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on
forecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with
increasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's
parameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find
that prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more
interpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits,
while hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable
strategies. Our results show that the quality and structure of the information
supplied to the agent are crucial: embedding probabilistic insights into latent
regimes substantially improves both profitability and robustness of
reinforcement learning-based trading strategies.

### [437] [SHAP values through General Fourier Representations: Theory and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00185)
*Roberto Morales*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper develops a spectral framework to analyze SHAP values rigorously, studying both deterministic and probabilistic regimes, with experiments validating the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding SHAP values and their stability in predictive models.

Method: The method involves constructing a generalized Fourier expansion for models and analyzing SHAP values as linear functionals of Fourier coefficients in deterministic and probabilistic settings.

Result: The paper demonstrates that SHAP attributions are stable under Fourier truncation and converge for neural networks in the infinite-width limit, backed by numerical and theoretical validations.

Conclusion: SHAP values can be mathematically analyzed and bounded in stability and convergence using spectral methods, supported by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This article establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the mathematical
analysis of SHAP values. We show that any predictive model defined on a
discrete or multi-valued input space admits a generalized Fourier expansion
with respect to an orthonormalisation tensor-product basis constructed under a
product probability measure. Within this setting, each SHAP attribution can be
represented as a linear functional of the model's Fourier coefficients.
  Two complementary regimes are studied. In the deterministic regime, we derive
quantitative stability estimates for SHAP values under Fourier truncation,
showing that the attribution map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
distance between predictors. In the probabilistic regime, we consider neural
networks in their infinite-width limit and prove convergence of SHAP values
toward those induced by the corresponding Gaussian process prior, with explicit
error bounds in expectation and with high probability based on concentration
inequalities.
  We also provide a numerical experiment on a clinical unbalanced dataset to
validate the theoretical findings.

### [439] [SM-based Semantics for Answer Set Programs Containing Conditional Literals and Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01753)
*Zachary Hansen,Yuliya Lierler*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semantics for logic programs with conditional literals and arithmetic that do not require grounding, improving expressivity and simplifying representations in answer set programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current semantics which rely on grounding and a translation to infinitary propositional logic for programs with conditional literals.

Method: The paper introduces a new semantics based on the SM operator, ensuring that logic programs with conditional literals operate effectively without grounding.

Result: The proposed semantics is shown to correspond precisely with established semantics, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research advances the expressivity and simplicity in answer set programming by offering an alternative semantics approach for conditional literals, enhancing knowledge representation.

Abstract: Modern answer set programming solvers such as CLINGO support advanced
language constructs that improve the expressivity and conciseness of logic
programs. Conditional literals are one such construct. They form "subformulas"
that behave as nested implications within the bodies of logic rules. Their
inclusion brings the form of rules closer to the less restrictive syntax of
first-order logic. These qualities make conditional literals useful tools for
knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose a semantics for logic
programs with conditional literals and arithmetic based on the SM operator.
These semantics do not require grounding, unlike the established semantics for
such programs that relies on a translation to infinitary propositional logic.
The main result of this paper establishes the precise correspondence between
the proposed and existing semantics.

*Hangdong Zhao,Zhenghong Yu,Srinag Rao,Simon Frisk,Zhiwei Fan,Paraschos Koutris*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: FlowLog addresses efficiency and extensibility in Datalog-based languages by separating recursive control and logical plans, achieving high performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Datalog systems lack a balance between efficiency and extensibility, with domain-specific designs or modularity struggling to incorporate specific optimizations.

Method: FlowLog introduces an explicit relational IR per rule, applies SQL optimizations at the logical level, and adopts a robustness-first approach for recursive workloads, building on Differential Dataflow.

Result: FlowLog outperforms leading Datalog engines and databases across recursive workloads with superior scalability and robust architecture.

Conclusion: FlowLog provides an efficient and extensible solution for Datalog-based computations, supporting both batch and incremental processing with recursion-aware optimizations.

Abstract: Datalog-based languages are regaining popularity as a powerful abstraction
for expressing recursive computations in domains such as program analysis and
graph processing. However, existing systems often face a trade-off between
efficiency and extensibility. Engines like Souffle achieve high efficiency
through domain-specific designs, but lack general-purpose flexibility. Others,
like RecStep, offer modularity by layering Datalog on traditional databases,
but struggle to integrate Datalog-specific optimizations.
  This paper bridges this gap by presenting FlowLog, a new Datalog engine that
uses an explicit relational IR per-rule to cleanly separate recursive control
(e.g., semi-naive execution) from each rule's logical plan. This boundary lets
us retain fine-grained, Datalog-aware optimizations at the logical layer, but
also reuse off-the-shelf database primitives at execution. At the logical level
(i.e. IR), we apply proven SQL optimizations, such as logic fusion and subplan
reuse. To address high volatility in recursive workloads, we adopt a
robustness-first approach that pairs a structural optimizer (avoiding
worst-case joins) with sideways information passing (early filtering). Built
atop Differential Dataflow--a mature framework for streaming analytics--FlowLog
supports both batch and incremental Datalog and adds novel recursion-aware
optimizations called Boolean (or algebraic) specialization. Our evaluation
shows that FlowLog outperforms state-of-the-art Datalog engines and modern
databases across a broad range of recursive workloads, achieving superior
scalability while preserving a simple and extensible architecture.

*Xuelin Yang,Licong Lin,Susan Athey,Michael I. Jordan,Guido W. Imbens*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for combining experimental and observational data in causal inference using empirical risk minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of combining the strong validity of experiments with the large sample size of observational data, despite biases in observational data due to unmeasured confounders.

Method: The paper proposes a causal inference framework by formulating the estimation as an empirical risk minimization problem. It minimizes a weighted combination of experimental and observational losses with cross-validation for weight selection.

Result: Experiments using real and synthetic data demonstrate the reliability and efficacy of the proposed framework. Theoretical non-asymptotic error bounds are also provided.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates experimental and observational data, balancing validity and fit to overcome limitations from small experimental samples and observational biases.

Abstract: We develop new methods to integrate experimental and observational data in
causal inference. While randomized controlled trials offer strong internal
validity, they are often costly and therefore limited in sample size.
Observational data, though cheaper and often with larger sample sizes, are
prone to biases due to unmeasured confounders. To harness their complementary
strengths, we propose a systematic framework that formulates causal estimation
as an empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem. A full model containing the
causal parameter is obtained by minimizing a weighted combination of
experimental and observational losses--capturing the causal parameter's
validity and the full model's fit, respectively. The weight is chosen through
cross-validation on the causal parameter across experimental folds. Our
experiments on real and synthetic data show the efficacy and reliability of our
method. We also provide theoretical non-asymptotic error bounds.

*Siva Sai,Manish Prasad,Animesh Bhargava,Vinay Chamola,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a split learning framework for IoT malware detection, addressing limitations like low resource availability and challenges in federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of IoMT devices has led to security risks, including malware targeting resource-constrained systems. Existing solutions like conventional deep learning and FL methods are inadequately suited for these scenarios.

Method: The proposed method uses split learning (SL) with image-based classification to divide neural network training between clients and an edge server. It includes a game-theoretic optimization for balancing computational and communication demands.

Result: The framework achieves higher accuracy (+6.35%), better F1-score (+5.03%), faster convergence (+14.96%), and reduced resource usage (33.83%) compared to FL methods.

Conclusion: Split learning is demonstrated as an effective, scalable, and secure approach for enhancing IoT security framework performance against malware attacks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices has resulted in
significant security risks, particularly the risk of malware attacks on
resource-constrained devices. Conventional deep learning methods are
impractical due to resource limitations, while Federated Learning (FL) suffers
from high communication overhead and vulnerability to non-IID (heterogeneous)
data. In this paper, we propose a split learning (SL) based framework for IoT
malware detection through image-based classification. By dividing the neural
network training between the clients and an edge server, the framework reduces
computational burden on resource-constrained clients while ensuring data
privacy. We formulate a joint optimization problem that balances computation
cost and communication efficiency by using a game-theoretic approach for
attaining better training performance. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed framework outperforms popular FL methods in terms of accuracy
(+6.35%), F1-score (+5.03%), high convergence speed (+14.96%), and less
resource consumption (33.83%). These results establish the potential of SL as a
scalable and secure paradigm for next-generation IoT security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the use of Federated Learning (FL) for ransomware detection, showing it improves accuracy by 9% while preserving privacy and complying with regulatory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve ransomware detection across interconnected systems under privacy, security, and legal limitations without centralizing sensitive data.

Method: Used the Sherpa.ai FL platform for Federated Learning to collaboratively train ransomware detection models using the RanSAP dataset while keeping raw data decentralized to preserve privacy.

Result: FL raised ransomware detection accuracy by 9% compared to server-local models and matched the performance of centralized models.

Conclusion: Federated Learning provides an effective, privacy-preserving, and scalable approach to ransomware detection, addressing challenges of data security and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Detecting malware, especially ransomware, is essential to securing today's
interconnected ecosystems, including cloud storage, enterprise file-sharing,
and database services. Training high-performing artificial intelligence (AI)
detectors requires diverse datasets, which are often distributed across
multiple organizations, making centralization necessary. However, centralized
learning is often impractical due to security, privacy regulations, data
ownership issues, and legal barriers to cross-organizational sharing.
Compounding this challenge, ransomware evolves rapidly, demanding models that
are both robust and adaptable.
  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL
platform, which enables multiple organizations to collaboratively train a
ransomware detection model while keeping raw data local and secure. This
paradigm is particularly relevant for cybersecurity companies (including both
software and hardware vendors) that deploy ransomware detection or firewall
systems across millions of endpoints. In such environments, data cannot be
transferred outside the customer's device due to strict security, privacy, or
regulatory constraints. Although FL applies broadly to malware threats, we
validate the approach using the Ransomware Storage Access Patterns (RanSAP)
dataset.
  Our experiments demonstrate that FL improves ransomware detection accuracy by
a relative 9% over server-local models and achieves performance comparable to
centralized training. These results indicate that FL offers a scalable,
high-performing, and privacy-preserving framework for proactive ransomware
detection across organizational and regulatory boundaries.

Motivation: Address challenges in existing evaluations of AI-based BFSD tools, such as limited datasets and analysis of performance factors.

Method: Constructed high-quality datasets (BinAtlas and BinAres) and evaluated nine BFSD tools to identify challenges, compare consistency, and propose a performance-enhancing strategy.

Result: Evaluation showcased current challenges and inconsistencies among tools; combining tools offered a 13.4% performance improvement.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding and practical adoption of BFSD tools, while setting a foundation for future research and resource development in this area.

Abstract: Binary Function Similarity Detection (BFSD) is a foundational technique in
software security, underpinning a wide range of applications including
vulnerability detection, malware analysis. Recent advances in AI-based BFSD
tools have led to significant performance improvements. However, existing
evaluations of these tools suffer from three key limitations: a lack of
in-depth analysis of performance-influencing factors, an absence of realistic
application analysis, and reliance on small-scale or low-quality datasets.
  In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of AI-based
BFSD tools to address these gaps. We construct two high-quality and diverse
datasets: BinAtlas, comprising 12,453 binaries and over 7 million functions for
capability evaluation; and BinAres, containing 12,291 binaries and 54
real-world 1-day vulnerabilities for evaluating vulnerability detection
performance in practical IoT firmware settings. Using these datasets, we
evaluate nine representative BFSD tools, analyze the challenges and limitations
of existing BFSD tools, and investigate the consistency among BFSD tools. We
also propose an actionable strategy for combining BFSD tools to enhance overall
performance (an improvement of 13.4%). Our study not only advances the
practical adoption of BFSD tools but also provides valuable resources and
insights to guide future research in scalable and automated binary similarity
detection.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a supply chain attack on SROS 2, showing how compromised credentials facilitate various malicious actions in robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to expose vulnerabilities within the Secure ROS 2 (SROS 2) framework, highlighting the potential risks of supply chain attacks and emphasizing the importance of enhancing security measures for autonomous systems.

Method: Researchers executed a Trojan-infected Debian package to alter ROS 2 security processes, intercept credentials, and simulate spoofed control commands in a controlled experiment.

Result: The attack successfully caused malicious behaviors in a robotic system, e.g., forced braking, false stop signs, and unrelenting turns during semiautonomous navigation.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for robust supply chain integrity controls and runtime semantic validation to mitigate insider and impersonation threats in autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept supply chain attack against the Secure
ROS 2 (SROS 2) framework, demonstrated on a Quanser QCar2 autonomous vehicle
platform. A Trojan-infected Debian package modifies core ROS 2 security
commands to exfiltrate newly generated keystore credentials via DNS in
base64-encoded chunks to an attacker-controlled nameserver. Possession of these
credentials enables the attacker to rejoin the SROS 2 network as an
authenticated participant and publish spoofed control or perception messages
without triggering authentication failures. We evaluate this capability on a
secure ROS 2 Humble testbed configured for a four-stop-sign navigation routine
using an Intel RealSense camera for perception. Experimental results show that
control-topic injections can cause forced braking, sustained high-speed
acceleration, and continuous turning loops, while perception-topic spoofing can
induce phantom stop signs or suppress real detections. The attack generalizes
to any data distribution service (DDS)-based robotic system using SROS 2,
highlighting the need for both supply chain integrity controls and runtime
semantic validation to safeguard autonomous systems against insider and
impersonation threats.

*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hi-WaveTST, a novel hybrid time-series classifier that improves upon PatchTST by integrating a new high-frequency feature stream.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a gap in current SOTA time-series classifiers, like PatchTST, which overlook non-obvious high-frequency information crucial for improving classification.

Method: The proposed method, Hi-WaveTST, combines temporal patch information with features derived from a learnable, high-frequency wavelet feature stream produced by deep Wavelet Packet Decomposition and a Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling layer.

Result: Hi-WaveTST achieved 93.38% accuracy on the UCI-HAR benchmark, outperforming the 92.59% accuracy of the SOTA PatchTST model.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that augmenting temporal dynamics with high-frequency wavelet features provides significant performance gains for time-series classification, and every component in Hi-WaveTST's architecture is deemed essential.

Abstract: Transformers have become state-of-the-art (SOTA) for time-series
classification, with models like PatchTST demonstrating exceptional
performance. These models rely on patching the time series and learning
relationships between raw temporal data blocks. We argue that this approach is
blind to critical, non-obvious high-frequency information that is complementary
to the temporal dynamics. In this letter, we propose Hi-WaveTST, a novel Hybrid
architecture that augments the original temporal patch with a learnable,
High-Frequency wavelet feature stream. Our wavelet stream uses a deep Wavelet
Packet Decomposition (WPD) on each patch and extracts features using a
learnable Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling layer. On the UCI-HAR benchmark
dataset, our hybrid model achieves a mean accuracy of 93.38 percent plus-minus
0.0043, significantly outperforming the SOTA PatchTST baseline (92.59 percent
plus-minus 0.0039). A comprehensive ablation study proves that every component
of our design-the hybrid architecture, the deep high-frequency wavelet
decomposition, and the learnable GeM pooling-is essential for this
state-of-the-art performance.

*Yeonju Ro,Haoran Qiu,Íñigo Goiri,Rodrigo Fonseca,Ricardo Bianchini,Aditya Akella,Zhangyang Wang,Mattan Erez,Esha Choukse*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sherlock, a verification method for error-prone nodes in agentic LLM workflows, which improves accuracy and reduces latency and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of agentic workflows with LLMs demands more reliable systems due to inherent error propagation throughout multi-step processes.

Method: Sherlock identifies error-prone nodes through counterfactual analysis, selectively attaches cost-optimal verifiers, and uses speculative execution to reduce latency while running verification in the background.

Result: Sherlock improves accuracy by 18.3%, reduces execution time by up to 48.7%, and lowers verification costs by 26.0%.

Conclusion: Sherlock successfully balances efficiency and reliability in LLM-based workflows by strategically verifying critical nodes and optimizing execution processes.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLM), agentic
workflows, which compose multiple LLM calls with tools, retrieval, and
reasoning steps, are increasingly replacing traditional applications. However,
such workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct
output at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages,
compounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating
verifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,
or LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant
latency and cost overheads.
  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a
workflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to
select the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification
with minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using
counterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and
selectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,
Sherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,
while verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is
rolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying
baseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across
benchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over
non-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the
Monte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware
verification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic
workflows.

TL;DR: AgentGit introduces Git-like rollback and branching capabilities to multi-agent systems (MAS) to enhance reliability, scalability, and exploration in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current MAS frameworks which struggle with reliability and scalability on complex tasks.

Method: AgentGit was developed as an infrastructure layer over LangGraph, incorporating Git-like features such as state commit, revert, and branching for efficient multi-agent workflows. The system was evaluated using a multi-step A/B test against three baselines on a real-world task.

Result: AgentGit outperformed LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno in reducing redundant computation, lowering runtime and token usage, and enabling parallel exploration.

Conclusion: AgentGit offers a pathway to more robust MAS development, facilitating error recovery, iterative debugging, A/B testing, and safe exploratory experimentation.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered
multi-agent systems (MAS) are drawing increasing interest across academia and
industry. However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and
scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that
brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an
infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit,
revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore
multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an
experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a
multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno --
on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show
that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and
token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches,
enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers
a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe
exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in scalable sampling for high-dimensional imaging inverse problems, focusing on uncertainty quantification in the absence of ground-truth data.

Method: The method combines a Plug-and-Play MCMC algorithm (PnP-ULA) with approximate data augmentation and lightweight denoising neural networks to utilize multiple GPUs efficiently.

Result: The distributed sampler achieves scalability, reliable uncertainty quantification, and reconstruction performance comparable to existing methods, while minimizing communication and computation overheads.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a scalable solution for high-resolution image reconstruction with uncertainty quantification, showing promising results in comparison to other methods.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are standard approaches to solve
imaging inverse problems and quantify estimation uncertainties, a key
requirement in absence of ground-truth data. To improve estimation quality,
Plug-and-Play MCMC algorithms, such as PnP-ULA, have been recently developed to
accommodate priors encoded by a denoising neural network. Designing scalable
samplers for high-dimensional imaging inverse problems remains a challenge:
drawing and storing high-dimensional samples can be prohibitive, especially for
high-resolution images. To address this issue, this work proposes a distributed
sampler based on approximate data augmentation and PnP-ULA to solve very large
problems. The proposed sampler uses lightweight denoising convolutional neural
network, to efficiently exploit multiple GPUs on a Single Program Multiple Data
architecture. Reconstruction performance and scalability are evaluated on
several imaging problems. Communication and computation overheads due to the
denoiser are carefully discussed. The proposed distributed approach noticeably
combines three very precious qualities: it is scalable, enables uncertainty
quantification, for a reconstruction performance comparable to other PnP
methods.

Method: A dual-channel magnetic chamber was designed with optimized coils, delivering uniform magnetic fields at different frequencies. Safety measures like liquid cooling and temperature control were integrated.

Result: The chamber achieved high-frequency magnetic field generation with negligible interference, uniform distribution, and stable operations. Spectral heating validation demonstrated channel-specific control with cobalt-doped nanoparticles.

Conclusion: The novel system provides reliable and safe dual-frequency magnetic stimulation for in vivo applications, showcasing channel-specific precision and behavioral observation capabilities.

Abstract: Several novel methods, including magnetogenetics and magnetoelectric
stimulation, use high frequency alternating magnetic fields to precisely
manipulate neural activity. To quantify the behavioral effects of such
interventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic
chamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic
stimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields.
Through an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two
spatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies
within a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal
frequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5
mT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV
and currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling
system enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an
observation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within
the chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two
widely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%).
Relatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the
chamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase
of the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to <
0.35 {\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron
oxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5
{\deg}C/s and 1.5 {\deg}C/s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity.
Both channels can run continuously for four seconds stably.

### [452] [Sorting by Strip Swaps is NP-Hard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00015)
*Swapnoneel Roy,Asai Asaithambi,Debajyoti Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper proves that Sorting by Strip Swaps (SbSS) is NP-hard via a reduction from Block Sorting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the computational complexity of sorting by strip swaps and prove its NP-hardness.

Method: A polynomial reduction from Block Sorting to SbSS is employed, introducing gadgets like 'cages' and 'hinges' to establish equivalence between SbSS schedules and block sorting schedules.

Result: SbSS is shown to be NP-hard through the established reduction and gadget framework.

Conclusion: Sorting by Strip Swaps is computationally complex (NP-hard), highlighting the challenges of solving related problems in permutation sorting.

Abstract: We show that \emph{Sorting by Strip Swaps} (SbSS) is NP-hard by a polynomial
reduction of \emph{Block Sorting}. The key idea is a local gadget, a
\emph{cage}, that replaces every decreasing adjacency $(a_i,a_{i+1})$ by a
guarded triple $a_i,m_i,a_{i+1}$ enclosed by guards $L_i,U_i$, so the only
decreasing adjacencies are the two inside the cage. Small \emph{hinge} gadgets
couple adjacent cages that share an element and enforce that a strip swap that
removes exactly two adjacencies corresponds bijectively to a block move that
removes exactly one decreasing adjacency in the source permutation. This yields
a clean equivalence between exact SbSS schedules and perfect block schedules,
establishing NP-hardness.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: PEARL is a system designed to enhance low-power multicore platforms for efficient intermittent computing, surpassing existing solutions in performance by up to 30x and reducing energy consumption by up to 32x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-power multicore platforms, though suitable for parallel data-intensive tasks, are inefficient for intermittent power computing, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: PEARL incorporates a three-threshold voltage tracking circuit and external fast non-volatile memory, managed by runtime software for adaptive power-aware multicore configuration.

Result: PEARL significantly reduces backup overheads while boosting performance, showing up to 30x improvement in performance and up to 32x reduction in energy consumption compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: PEARL establishes a novel and efficient approach to enable intermittent computing on multicore microcontroller platforms, advancing performance and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Low-power multicore platforms are suitable for running data-intensive tasks
in parallel, but they are highly inefficient for computing on intermittent
power. In this work, we present PEARL (PowEr And eneRgy-aware MuLticore
Intermittent Computing), a novel systems support that can make existing
multicore microcontroller (MCU) platforms suitable for efficient intermittent
computing. PEARL achieves this by leveraging only a three-threshold voltage
tracking circuit and an external fast non-volatile memory, which multicore MCUs
can smoothly interface. PEARL software runtime manages these components and
performs energy- and power-aware adaptation of the multicore configuration to
introduce minimal backup overheads and boost performance. Our evaluation shows
that PEARL outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by up to 30x and consumes
up to 32x less energy.

*Marco Cayuela,Vincent Le Chenadec,Peter Schmid,Taraneh Sayadi*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a model for decomposing turbulent fluid flows across scales, enhancing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address the challenge of explaining the inner workings of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) in modeling turbulent flows by developing a more interpretable, multiscale architecture.

Method: HFNOs employ Fourier transforms to separate fluid behavior into wavenumber bins, processed via Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) and further refined using CNN or ESN architectures.

Result: HFNOs successfully decompose turbulent flows, accurately modeling the dynamics of three examples: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Kolmogorov flow, and wall shear stress in channel flow.

Conclusion: The proposed HFNO architecture enhances the interpretability and capability of multiscale modeling in turbulent fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have demonstrated exceptional accuracy in
mapping functional spaces by leveraging Fourier transforms to establish a
connection with underlying physical principles. However, their opaque inner
workings often constitute an obstacle to physical interpretability. This work
introduces Hierarchical Fourier Neural Operators (HFNOs), a novel FNO-based
architecture tailored for reduced-order modeling of turbulent fluid flows,
designed to enhance interpretability by explicitly separating fluid behavior
across scales. The proposed architecture processes wavenumber bins in parallel,
enabling the approximation of dispersion relations and non-linear interactions.
Inputs are lifted to a higher-dimensional space, Fourier-transformed, and
partitioned into wavenumber bins. Each bin is processed by a Fully Connected
Neural Network (FCNN), with outputs subsequently padded, summed, and
inverse-transformed back into physical space. A final transformation refines
the output in physical space as a correction model, by means of one of the
following architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Echo State
Network (ESN). We evaluate the proposed model on a series of increasingly
complex dynamical systems: first on the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation, then on the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and finally on the
prediction of wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow, given the near-wall
velocity field. In all test cases, the model demonstrates its ability to
decompose turbulent flows across various scales, opening up the possibility of
increased interpretability and multiscale modeling of such flows.

*Botao 'Amber' Hu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores the connection between human improvisation and AI's capability to improvise in an open-ended way, utilizing qualities like active listening, mindfulness, randomness, empathy, and playfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI can genuinely perform open-ended improvisation like humans and understand what constitutes 'good' improvisation for AI.

Method: Conducted in-depth interviews with 6 experts in improvisation from fields such as dance, music, and contact improvisation.

Result: Provides systemic insights into how AI can embody qualities of human improvisational arts, potentially enabling AI agents to improvise alone, alongside humans, or with other AI agents.

Conclusion: AI has the potential to learn improvisation based on human practices, enabling the design of experiential AI agents that embody creativity, adaptability, and open-endedness.

Abstract: Improvisation-the art of spontaneous creation that unfolds moment-to-moment
without a scripted outcome-requires practitioners to continuously sense, adapt,
and create anew. It is a fundamental mode of human creativity spanning music,
dance, and everyday life. The open-ended nature of improvisation produces a
stream of novel, unrepeatable moments-an aspect highly valued in artistic
creativity. In parallel, open-endedness (OE)-a system's capacity for unbounded
novelty and endless "interestingness"-is exemplified in natural or cultural
evolution and has been considered "the last grand challenge" in artificial life
(ALife). The rise of generative AI now raises the question in computational
creativity (CC) research: What makes a "good" improvisation for AI? Can AI
learn to improvise in a genuinely open-ended way? In this work-in-progress
paper, we report insights from in-depth interviews with 6 experts in
improvisation across dance, music, and contact improvisation. We draw systemic
connections between human improvisational arts and the design of future
experiential AI agents that could improvise alone or alongside humans-or even
with other AI agents-embodying qualities of improvisation drawn from practice:
active listening (umwelt and awareness), being in the time (mindfulness and
ephemerality), embracing the unknown (source of randomness and serendipity),
non-judgmental flow (acceptance and dynamical stability, balancing structure
and surprise (unpredictable criticality at edge of chaos), imaginative metaphor
(synaesthesia and planning), empathy, trust, boundary, and care (mutual theory
of mind), and playfulness and intrinsic motivation (maintaining
interestingness).

TL;DR: This study addresses students' misconceptions about video game development through a lecture series by industry professionals, significantly improving their understanding and career motivation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students often enter game development with unrealistic beliefs about the field, which can hinder their learning experiences and future career satisfaction.

Method: A mixed-methods approach, including qualitative analysis and a novel quantitative tool, was used to evaluate the impact of a 15-hour professional lecture series on 91 students and 94 industry professionals.

Result: The intervention reduced misconceptions and enhanced student motivation by presenting a realistic view of the technical, collaborative, and business aspects of game development.

Conclusion: Incorporating industry-expert-led interventions in early education can better prepare students for the realities of game development, improving learning and supporting informed career decisions.

Abstract: This study examines students' na\"ive mindset (misconceptions) about video
game development, idealized and inaccurate beliefs that shape an unrealistic
understanding of the field. The research evaluated the effectiveness of a
fifteen-hour-long lecture series delivered by industry professionals, designed
to challenge this mindset and expose students to the complexities and realities
of game production. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining
qualitative analysis with a prototype quantitative tool developed to measure
levels of misconception. Participants included students (n = 91) from diverse
academic backgrounds interested in game creation and professionals (n = 94)
working in the video game industry. Findings show that the intervention
significantly reduced students' na\"ive beliefs while enhancing their
motivation to pursue careers in the industry. Exposure to professional
perspectives fostered a more realistic and informed mindset, taking into
account the understanding of the technical, collaborative, and business aspects
of game development. The results suggest that incorporating similar expert-led
interventions early in game development education can improve learning
outcomes, support informed career choices, and mitigate future professional
disappointment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disaster assessment using social media by addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance and limited datasets.

Method: The paper uses diffusion-based methods for visual data and transformer-based techniques for text data augmentation, evaluating their impact on different learning setups.

Result: The augmentations improved classification performance, particularly for underrepresented classes, with potential shown in multi-view learning setups.

Conclusion: Augmentation strategies can enhance disaster classification systems, but further refinement is needed for multi-view learning approaches.

Abstract: Natural disaster assessment relies on accurate and rapid access to
information, with social media emerging as a valuable real-time source.
However, existing datasets suffer from class imbalance and limited samples,
making effective model development a challenging task. This paper explores
augmentation techniques to address these issues on the CrisisMMD multimodal
dataset. For visual data, we apply diffusion-based methods, namely Real
Guidance and DiffuseMix. For text data, we explore back-translation,
paraphrasing with transformers, and image caption-based augmentation. We
evaluated these across unimodal, multimodal, and multi-view learning setups.
Results show that selected augmentations improve classification performance,
particularly for underrepresented classes, while multi-view learning introduces
potential but requires further refinement. This study highlights effective
augmentation strategies for building more robust disaster assessment systems.

*Haotian Hang,Yueyang Shen,Vicky Zhu,Jose Cruz,Michelle Li*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents a decision-support framework using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate corporate climate disclosure quality using Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) data, highlighting benchmarking insights and industry/regional differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing global sustainability mandates necessitate advanced mechanisms like carbon disclosure for businesses to align with environmental responsibilities, but challenges exist in analyzing heterogeneous climate-related data effectively.

Method: The paper develops a rubric-based framework that utilizes LLMs to assess corporate disclosure quality and processes narratives from 11 years (2010-2020) of CDP data. It combines rubric-guided scoring with percentile-based normalization for cross-sector and cross-country analysis.

Result: The approach successfully identifies trends, strategic patterns, and inconsistencies in climate disclosures across industries and regions. It found that sectors like technology or nations like Germany show stronger alignment while others illustrate volatility.

Conclusion: The research underscores the immense value of LLM-driven frameworks in transforming unstructured climate data into actionable insights, aiding investors, regulators, and ESG strategists in advancing climate governance and decision-making.

Abstract: In the context of global sustainability mandates, corporate carbon disclosure
has emerged as a critical mechanism for aligning business strategy with
environmental responsibility. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) hosts the
world's largest longitudinal dataset of climate-related survey responses,
combining structured indicators with open-ended narratives, but the
heterogeneity and free-form nature of these disclosures present significant
analytical challenges for benchmarking, compliance monitoring, and investment
screening. This paper proposes a novel decision-support framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to assess corporate climate disclosure
quality at scale. It develops a master rubric that harmonizes narrative scoring
across 11 years of CDP data (2010-2020), enabling cross-sector and
cross-country benchmarking. By integrating rubric-guided scoring with
percentile-based normalization, our method identifies temporal trends,
strategic alignment patterns, and inconsistencies in disclosure across
industries and regions. Results reveal that sectors such as technology and
countries like Germany consistently demonstrate higher rubric alignment, while
others exhibit volatility or superficial engagement, offering insights that
inform key decision-making processes for investors, regulators, and corporate
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategists. The proposed LLM-based
approach transforms unstructured disclosures into quantifiable, interpretable,
comparable, and actionable intelligence, advancing the capabilities of
AI-enabled decision support systems (DSSs) in the domain of climate governance.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper argues that regulation and innovation are complementary, using the EU AI Act as a model for responsible, risk-based regulation that fosters innovation while addressing risks to society.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the misconception that regulation inhibits innovation and demonstrate how thoughtful regulation can prevent societal harms caused by unregulated AI technologies.

Method: Examines the EU AI Act as a case study, highlighting its adaptive mechanisms like regulatory sandboxes, SMEs support, and impact assessments to propose responsible AI regulation.

Result: The paper highlights how governance tools can transform perceived regulatory barriers into benefits like legal certainty, consumer trust, and ethical competitiveness.

Conclusion: Regulation and innovation are mutually reinforcing, and the EU AI Act exemplifies how transparency, accountability, and fundamental rights can define responsible AI innovation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) now permeates critical infrastructures and
decision-making systems where failures produce social, economic, and democratic
harm. This position paper challenges the entrenched belief that regulation and
innovation are opposites. As evidenced by analogies from aviation,
pharmaceuticals, and welfare systems and recent cases of synthetic
misinformation, bias and unaccountable decision-making, the absence of
well-designed regulation has already created immeasurable damage. Regulation,
when thoughtful and adaptive, is not a brake on innovation--it is its
foundation. The present position paper examines the EU AI Act as a model of
risk-based, responsibility-driven regulation that addresses the Collingridge
Dilemma: acting early enough to prevent harm, yet flexibly enough to sustain
innovation. Its adaptive mechanisms--regulatory sandboxes, small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) support, real-world testing, fundamental rights impact
assessment (FRIA) -- demonstrate how regulation can accelerate responsibly,
rather than delay, technological progress. The position paper summarises how
governance tools transform perceived burdens into tangible advantages: legal
certainty, consumer trust, and ethical competitiveness. Ultimately, the paper
reframes progress: innovation and regulation advance together. By embedding
transparency, impact assessments, accountability, and AI literacy into design
and deployment, the EU framework defines what responsible innovation truly
means--technological ambition disciplined by democratic values and fundamental
rights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical complexity of simulated tempering in mixtures of log-concave components with location shifts.

Method: The paper employs a state decomposition theorem for $s$-conductance and constructs an auxiliary Markov chain on an augmented space. Analytical bounds are derived for simulated tempering configurations.

Result: Achieves polynomial-time guarantee for simulated tempering with MALA, and improved complexity estimates for random-walk Metropolis, under optimal inverse-temperature ladder configurations.

Conclusion: This research improves theoretical understanding of simulated tempering with specific settings and establishes first known polynomial-time guarantees in this domain.

Abstract: We study the theoretical complexity of simulated tempering for sampling from
mixtures of log-concave components differing only by location shifts. The main
result establishes the first polynomial-time guarantee for simulated tempering
combined with the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) with respect to
the problem dimension $d$, maximum mode displacement $D$, and logarithmic
accuracy $\log \epsilon^{-1}$. The proof builds on a general state
decomposition theorem for $s$-conductance, applied to an auxiliary Markov chain
constructed on an augmented space. We also obtain an improved complexity
estimate for simulated tempering combined with random-walk Metropolis. Our
bounds assume an inverse-temperature ladder with smallest value $\beta_1 =
O(D^{-2})$ and spacing $\beta_{i+1}/\beta_i = 1 + O( d^{-1/2} )$, both of which
are shown to be asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces two methods in the Magical Trust Region (MTR) framework, employing multifidelity approaches to enhance efficiency in solving trust-region subproblems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in solving trust-region subproblems by leveraging multifidelity frameworks and augmenting classical optimization steps.

Method: Developing two multifidelity methods: (1) Sketched Trust-Region (STR) using sketched matrix for dimensionality reduction, and (2) SVD Trust-Region (SVDTR) leveraging truncated singular value decomposition for directing variability.

Result: Numerical examples demonstrate the potential efficiency improvements provided by the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The multifidelity trust-region methods introduced, STR and SVDTR, enhance optimization frameworks with reduced computations and improved directionality.

Abstract: We introduce two multifidelity trust-region methods based on the Magical
Trust Region (MTR) framework. MTR augments the classical trust-region step with
a secondary, informative direction. In our approaches, the secondary
``magical'' directions are determined by solving coarse trust-region
subproblems based on low-fidelity objective models. The first proposed method,
Sketched Trust-Region (STR), constructs this secondary direction using a
sketched matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the trust-region subproblem.
The second method, SVD Trust-Region (SVDTR), defines the magical direction via
a truncated singular value decomposition of the dataset, capturing the leading
directions of variability. Several numerical examples illustrate the potential
gain in efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel serverless computing system emphasizing deterministic procedures and externalized I/O, aimed at enhancing efficiency in scheduling and data movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current serverless computing models face inefficiencies due to ambiguous computation representation and data handling, limiting task scheduling and network optimization.

Method: The researchers introduce a model where computation is represented as deterministic procedures run using specified data inputs and outputs, enabling better clarity and platform-driven data management.

Result: The system allows applications to precisely state the data needed at different stages, aiding the provider in reducing inefficiencies like task starvation and improving overall network transfer scheduling.

Conclusion: By externalizing I/O and adopting this design, the paper argues for a shift from "pay-for-effort" to "pay-for-results" in outsourced computing.

Abstract: We describe a system for serverless computing where users, programs,
  and the underlying platform share a common representation of a
  computation: a deterministic procedure, run in an environment
  of well-specified data or the outputs of other computations. This
  representation externalizes I/O: data movement over the network is
  performed exclusively by the platform. Applications can describe the
  precise data needed at each stage, helping the provider schedule
  tasks and network transfers to reduce starvation. The design
  suggests an end-to-end argument for outsourced computing, shifting
  the service model from ``pay-for-effort'' to ``pay-for-results.''

### [464] [Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures from Histogram Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01838)
*Zirui Deng,Netanel Raviv*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in using random linear codes in Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) for neurosymbolic AI, proposing a novel method using concatenated Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes to improve noise resilience and recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VSAs are gaining traction in neurosymbolic AI, but existing implementations suffer from decoding inefficiencies under noise, significantly limiting their usability in noisy environments.

Method: The authors propose enhancing VSAs by using concatenated Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes and introduce the histogram recovery problem to retrieve compositional representations efficiently. They provide a formal solution based on list-decoding algorithms.

Result: The proposed approach improves noise resilience, ensures quasi-orthogonality, and provides formal guarantees for encoding and recovery in VSAs. It surpasses existing methods in terms of parameters and performance.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel, efficient, and noise-resilient VSA framework with theoretical guarantees, eliminating the need for heuristics or training while outperforming comparable solutions.

Abstract: Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs) are a family of information
representation techniques which enable composition, i.e., creating complex
information structures from atomic vectors via binding and superposition, and
have recently found wide ranging applications in various neurosymbolic
artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Recently, Raviv proposed the use of
random linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables
efficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary
for neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under
noise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery,
i.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy
compositional representation.
  In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First,
we argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable
for VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a
folklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional
representations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In
histogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given
as input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length
$N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms. We present an
optimal solution to the histogram recovery problem by using algorithms related
to list-decoding, and analyze the resulting noise resilience. Our results give
rise to a noise-resilient VSA with formal guarantees regarding efficient
encoding, quasi-orthogonality, and recovery, without relying on any heuristics
or training, and while operating at improved parameters relative to similar
solutions such as the Hadamard code.
