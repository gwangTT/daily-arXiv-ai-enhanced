### [1] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Symbolic Regression (SR) for modeling 3D incompressible fluid flow, introducing a hybrid SR/ASP framework for interpretable and physically adherent predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting machine learning models in fluid mechanics and ensure predictions align with physical principles.

Method: Uses Symbolic Regression via the PySR library to derive mathematical relationships from simulation data and combines it with Answer Set Programming (ASP) for knowledge integration.

Result: Derived symbolic equations that accurately describe velocity and pressure fields, aligned with analytical solutions from the literature.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates SR's capability for interpretability in fluid systems and introduces a hybrid SR/ASP framework to improve adherence to physical principles.

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

### [2] [I2I-STRADA -- Information to Insights via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17874)
*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The I2I-STRADA architecture introduces a structured reasoning approach for analytical data workflows, outperforming prior models in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems for data analysis fail to consider structured reasoning workflows, which are crucial for real-world data analysis.

Method: The authors propose I2I-STRADA, a framework that models data analysis through modular sub-tasks mimicking cognitive reasoning steps, such as goal interpretation, plan construction, and execution adaptation.

Result: The I2I-STRADA system outperformed existing systems in benchmarks (DABstep and DABench), showcasing improved planning coherence and insight alignment.

Conclusion: Structuring cognitive workflows in agentic systems significantly enhances data analysis processes, as evidenced by I2I-STRADA's superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

### [3] [SMARTAPS: Tool-augmented LLMs for Operations Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17927)
*Timothy Tin Long Yu,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Jabo Serge Byusa,Rindra Ramamonjison,Giuseppe Carenini,Kun Mao,Zirui Zhou,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartAPS is a conversational system employing large language models (LLMs) to make advanced planning systems (APS) accessible and user-friendly via a natural language chat interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many customers are unable to afford advanced planning systems (APS) due to high costs of consultant-driven customization and maintenance.

Method: A tool-augmented LLM-based conversational system is developed, enabling users to interact naturally with APS through intuitive querying, reasoning, and scenario analysis.

Result: SmartAPS allows planners to manage operations using natural language, simplifying tasks such as information querying, scenario simulation, and recommendation generation.

Conclusion: SmartAPS enhances user accessibility to APS, lowering barriers to adoption and enabling effective operational planning with conversational interfaces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

### [4] [Synthesis of timeline-based planning strategies avoiding determinization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17988)
*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning that maps directly to deterministic finite automata, enabling strategy synthesis without costly determinization steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in synthesizing planning strategies caused by reliance on nondeterministic finite automata, and to simplify the process within qualitative timeline-based planning.

Method: The authors identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning and determine its plan-existence problem as directly solvable using deterministic finite automata, incorporating a subset of Allen's relations.

Result: The study enables direct mapping of plan-existence problems in a specific planning fragment to deterministic finite automata, facilitating strategy synthesis and identifying a compatible subset of Allen's relations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies complex planning strategy synthesis by leveraging deterministic finite automata, presenting a practical solution within a specific fragment of timeline-based planning.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

### [5] [E.A.R.T.H.: Structuring Creative Evolution through Model Error in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18004)
*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the E.A.R.T.H. framework to convert AI model-generated errors into creative outputs, yielding improved creativity scores, increased novelty, and enhanced alignment with human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of advancing AI from imitation-based generation to creative and human-aligned output.

Method: The proposed E.A.R.T.H. pipeline consists of five stages (Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, Harness feedback), utilizing various AI models for structured prompts, semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation.

Result: At the Refine stage, creativity scores increased significantly by 52.5%, novel outputs were 40.7% shorter while maintaining relevance, and cross-modal tests showed strong slogan-to-image alignment validated with metrics like CLIPScore and BERTScore.

Conclusion: The findings establish that error-centered and feedback-driven generation enhances AI creativity, paving the way for scalable creative systems aligned with human expectations.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

### [6] [Does visualization help AI understand data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18022)
*Victoria R. Li,Johnathan Sun,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study explores whether AI systems benefit from visualization, finding that GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 perform better on analysis tasks when data is accompanied by scatterplots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Charts and graphs are widely used by humans for data analysis, but their utility for AI systems is unexplored. This paper seeks to understand if AI systems can also leverage visualizations for improved performance.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using two AI models, GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5, across analysis tasks with varying dataset complexities. They compared performance when synthetic data was presented with scatterplots versus baselines such as blank or mismatched charts.

Result: AI systems described datasets more precisely and accurately when scatterplots were integrated with data, particularly with complex datasets.

Conclusion: Visualization aids can enhance AI systems’ analytic capabilities, providing preliminary evidence that AI benefits from charts similarly to humans.

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

### [7] [Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18059)
*Yueheng Li,Guangming Xie,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGPO, a framework enhancing cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning by integrating centralized training with decentralized execution, achieving scalable and deployable solutions under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTDE approaches in MARL often fail to fully exploit centralized training or provide theoretical guarantees, creating a gap for effective and principled methods.

Method: MAGPO employs an auto-regressive joint policy for coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies. It ensures deployability using theoretical guarantees and practical evaluations across diverse environments.

Result: MAGPO consistently outperforms existing CTDE approaches and matches or surpasses fully centralized frameworks on a wide range of tasks.

Conclusion: MAGPO advances the CTDE paradigm with theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority, offering a scalable and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

### [8] [AlphaGo Moment for Model Architecture Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18074)
*Yixiu Liu,Yang Nan,Weixian Xu,Xiangkun Hu,Lyumanshan Ye,Zhen Qin,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Human-limited AI research bottleneck is addressed with ASI-Arch, an autonomous AI system that innovates in neural architecture discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI research is constrained by human cognitive limits and needs methods to break this bottleneck in innovation.

Method: Developed ASI-Arch, an AI system capable of conducting all phases of neural architecture discovery autonomously.

Result: ASI-Arch performed 1,773 experiments, discovering 106 state-of-the-art architectures and defined empirical scaling laws for computational research.

Conclusion: Autonomous AI systems can transform research from human-limited to scalable, opening avenues for faster scientific innovation and architectural breakthroughs.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

### [9] [Agentic AI framework for End-to-End Medical Data Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18115)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Shayan Vassef,Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Agentic AI framework to automate the clinical data pipeline from ingestion to inference using modular agents to address fragmentation, compatibility, and privacy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare ML solutions face challenges due to fragmented workflows and strict data privacy rules, making them costly and labor-intensive.

Method: The framework employs modular, task-specific agents to handle data ingestion, anonymization, feature extraction, model selection, data preprocessing, and inference across structured and unstructured clinical datasets.

Result: The system successfully processes datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging, ensuring privacy, selecting appropriate models, and providing interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: Automating key ML stages can reduce expert intervention, streamline workflows, and offer cost-effective operationalization paths for AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

### [10] [Actively evaluating and learning the distinctions that matter: Vaccine safety signal detection from emergency triage notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18123)
*Sedigh Khademi,Christopher Palmer,Muhammad Javed,Hazel Clothier,Jim Buttery,Gerardo Luis Dimaguila,Jim Black*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Active Learning to create a model that classifies vaccine safety issues using emergency department triage notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 vaccine rollout highlighted the need for effective post-licensure safety surveillance, as clinical trials provide limited safety data and early implementation requires real-world monitoring mechanisms.

Method: The researchers employed NLP combined with Active Learning, data augmentation, and evaluation techniques to facilitate the creation of a vaccine safety issue classifier using emergency department triage notes.

Result: The methodology enables rapid development of a classifier that addresses challenges such as scarce annotated data, similarity of conditions, and false positives, thereby enhancing vaccine safety signal surveillance.

Conclusion: Using sophisticated NLP and Active Learning techniques effectively improves vaccine safety monitoring, offering an efficient and accurate alternative to keyword-based classification methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [11] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the expressive capacity of graph neural networks (GNNs) using mean aggregation, comparing them against max and sum aggregation settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the choice of aggregation function (mean, max, or sum) impacts the expressive power of graph neural networks.

Method: Analyzing GNNs using mean aggregation, comparing their capacity to modal logics and other aggregation approaches like max and sum in both non-uniform and uniform settings.

Result: Mean aggregation GNNs align with ratio modal logic in non-uniform settings and alternation-free modal logic in uniform settings. Their expressive power varies depending on assumptions like continuity and thresholds.

Conclusion: Mean GNNs hold intermediate expressive power compared to max and sum aggregation approaches; their capacity increases when natural assumptions are removed.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [12] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to differentiate knowledge and reasoning in large language models (LLMs), analyzing their roles using two distinct cognitive modes inspired by dual-system cognitive theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model analysis, interpretability, and development by decoupling the roles of knowledge and reasoning in LLM performance.

Method: The authors decompose LLM cognition into two phases: knowledge retrieval and reasoning adjustment. They prompt LLMs to operate under 'fast thinking' and 'slow thinking' modes and analyze their performance across 15 LLMs and 3 datasets.

Result: (1) Reasoning benefits reasoning-intensive domains like mathematics, physics, and chemistry but may impair knowledge-heavy ones. (2) Parameter scaling enhances both knowledge and reasoning, with scaling making reasoning more prudent and moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge is concentrated in lower layers of the neural network, while reasoning occurs in higher layers.

Conclusion: This cognition attribution framework sheds light on LLM behavior by decoupling knowledge and reasoning phases, offering insights into scaling laws, hierarchical knowledge editing, and small-model reasoning limitations.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [13] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares four alternative semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming, highlighting a unified approach between three of them and differentiating it from a fourth classical logic-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-minimal disjunction semantics alternatives to stable models in Answer Set Programming, and analyze their relationships and implications.

Method: The authors analyze and compare four disjunction frameworks—Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models, Forks, and Determining Inference semantics—through formal proofs and semantic comparisons.

Result: It is proven that Forks, Justified Models, and a relaxed DI semantics converge to a common semantics, which is broader than stable models and stronger than Strongly Supported Models.

Conclusion: Three semantics form a unified approach offering a stronger framework than stable models for disjunction, while Strongly Supported Models adhere more to classical logic principles.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The chapter develops a qualitative risk assessment framework for AI systems under EU AI Act, concentrating on protecting fundamental rights using logic-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complexities in legal compliance and ensure effective protection of fundamental rights during AI deployment.

Method: Introduces definitional balancing (proportionality analysis) and defeasible reasoning to handle rights conflicts and dynamic legal decision-making.

Result: Proposes a layered approach involving foundational philosophy and logical methods enabling comprehensive assessment of AI's impact on rights.

Conclusion: The framework guides high-risk AI and General Purpose AI assessments and aims to evolve into formal models for practical responsible AI governance.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

*Peter Baumgartner,Lachlan McGinness*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automate Physics exam marking by interpreting student responses, formalizing them into a machine-readable format, and assessing correctness using computational reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of consistent and efficient assessment of typed Physics exam answers against a ground truth solution.

Method: Utilizes a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver, term rewriting systems, and a Large Language Model for automated reasoning and student response processing.

Result: System is evaluated using over 1500 student responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad, showcasing its capability to handle trigonometric and other physics-related problems.

Conclusion: The developed method effectively combines automated reasoning tools and language models to provide a robust solution for Physics exam marking, with detailed work on ensuring term rewriting system properties.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Method: Introduced ConDiFi, a benchmark comprising 607 prompts for divergent reasoning and 990 adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning, tested on 14 leading LLMs.

Result: Highlighted differences among models, such as GPT-4o underperforming in Novelty and Actionability, while models like DeepSeek-R1 excel in generating actionable insights.

Conclusion: ConDiFi offers a fresh perspective to assess the reasoning capabilities needed for safe and strategic use of LLMs in the financial domain.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.

multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

### [17] [Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO) for large language models, improving reasoning via information bottleneck principles with lightweight regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning via RL is largely heuristic, lacking principled frameworks for improvement.

Method: The IBRO framework uses the information bottleneck principle to optimize reasoning trajectories and integrates lightweight IB regularization into RL with minimal code changes.

Result: Experiments show improved reasoning performance on mathematical benchmarks and diverse prompts using IB regularization.

Conclusion: IB regularization offers an efficient and effective enhancement to reasoning in LLMs, advancing principled approaches in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

*Kwong Ho Li,Wathsala Karunarathne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares Value Iteration (VI) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for optimizing call routing in call centers, where PPO achieved better results but required longer training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize client waiting time and staff idle time in call centers by leveraging reinforcement learning approaches.

Method: The study compares a model-based approach (Value Iteration) with a model-free approach (Proximal Policy Optimization) framed under a Markov Decision Process. Simulation using DES and OpenAI Gym is employed for evaluations.

Result: PPO achieves the highest rewards, minimizes client waiting time, and reduces staff idle time after 1,000 test episodes, though its training takes longer.

Conclusion: PPO proves more effective than VI for optimizing call center workflows, highlighting its potential for practical application, especially when performance outweighs training time concerns.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

*Enrico Santi,Fabio Tardivo,Agostino Dovier,Andrea Formisano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper enhances the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm for handling table constraints, utilizing modern GPUs for greater computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CPU-based approaches struggle with managing large table constraints in real-world applications, requiring more efficient solutions.

Method: The paper develops a GPU-accelerated version of the Compact-Table algorithm and integrates it into an existing constraint solver.

Result: Experimental validations show improved handling of large table constraints using GPU-based CT algorithm on various instances.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration offers significant potential in improving the efficiency of constraint propagation in large-scale table constraints.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

*Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro,Afonso Leote,João Leite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores concept probing for artificial neural networks, focusing on the impact of training data quality in image classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the interpretability challenges of artificial neural networks due to their large size and subsymbolic nature.

Method: Investigating how data quality influences the training of probing models and providing concept labels for common datasets.

Result: The study highlights the significance of training data in concept probing and publishes concept labels to aid further research.

Conclusion: Understanding and improving the data quality for concept probing enhances the interpretability of neural networks in image classification.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Motivation: To address limitations in alignment methods like RLHF and promote intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection in AI systems.

Method: SafeLadder framework employing progressive safety-focused reinforcement learning post-training and multiple verification mechanisms; additionally, inference-time interventions and deliberative search mechanism are implemented.

Result: SafeWork-R1 improves safety-related benchmarks by 46.54% over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B, surpassing GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4 in safety metrics, while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework showcases that safety and capability can evolve together, enabling robust, reliable, and trustworthy AI applicable across diverse models.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

### [22] [Designing High-Performance and Thermally Feasible Multi-Chiplet Architectures enabled by Non-bendable Glass Interposer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18040)
*Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Umit Y. Ogras,Partha Pratim Pande*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a design framework for multi-chiplet architectures using glass interposers, achieving better performance, power efficiency, and reliability by addressing warpage challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glass interposers, while promising improved electrical performance and interconnect capabilities over silicon interposers, suffer from significant warpage issues at larger scales, threatening reliability and usability.

Method: The authors propose a design framework that integrates architecture and packaging co-optimization, addressing thermal, warpage, and performance concerns by disintegrating the surface and embedded chiplets.

Result: Experiments show that this framework achieves up to 64.7% performance improvements and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D systems, specifically for deep neural network workloads.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that this co-optimized design framework ensures better trade-offs between performance, power, and structural reliability, making glass interposer-based systems viable for modern computing demands.

Abstract: Multi-chiplet architectures enabled by glass interposer offer superior
electrical performance, enable higher bus widths due to reduced crosstalk, and
have lower capacitance in the redistribution layer than current silicon
interposer-based systems. These advantages result in lower energy per bit,
higher communication frequencies, and extended interconnect range. However,
deformation of the package (warpage) in glass interposer-based systems becomes
a critical challenge as system size increases, leading to severe mechanical
stress and reliability concerns. Beyond a certain size, conventional packaging
techniques fail to manage warpage effectively, necessitating new approaches to
mitigate warpage induced bending with scalable performance for glass interposer
based multi-chiplet systems. To address these inter-twined challenges, we
propose a thermal-, warpage-, and performance-aware design framework that
employs architecture and packaging co-optimization. The proposed framework
disintegrates the surface and embedded chiplets to balance conflicting design
objectives, ensuring optimal trade-offs between performance, power, and
structural reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized
multi-chiplet architectures from our design framework achieve up to 64.7%
performance improvement and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D
systems to execute deep neural network workloads with lower fabrication costs.

*Juntao Zhao,Jiuru Li,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Sandwich is a CPU-based engine for serving large language models (LLMs), offering phase-specific optimization and outperforming traditional methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a resource-efficient method for serving large language models using CPUs while addressing inefficiencies in existing approaches that apply static partitioning and use standard vendor libraries.

Method: Sandwich employs a hardware-centric approach, designing separate execution plans for the prefill and decode phases of LLM inference and optimizing them independently. It also designs efficient GEMM kernels.

Result: On five CPU platforms, Sandwich achieves up to 2.01x improvement in throughput, better latencies, 3.40x reduced requirements in single-sequence serving, and enhanced performance in continuous-batching serving.

Conclusion: Sandwich demonstrates significant advancements in CPU-based LLM serving, providing a better-performing and more resource-friendly alternative to existing GPU and static CPU solutions.

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

*Ravan Nazaraliyev,Saber Ganjisaffar,Nurlan Nazaraliyev,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRACtical, a performance-optimized approach to mitigate Rowhammer issues in DRAM while maintaining security guarantees and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As DRAM density increases, Rowhammer attacks become more problematic due to faster charge leakage, and existing mitigations like PRAC+ABO introduce significant performance and energy overheads.

Method: PRACtical optimizes the PRAC+ABO mechanism by introducing a centralized increment circuit to reduce counter update latency and enabling bank-level granularity for mitigation, using a DRAM-resident register to isolate affected banks.

Result: The proposed PRACtical method improves performance by 8% on average (up to 20%), reduces energy consumption by 19%, and limits performance degradation to below 6% under severe performance attacks.

Conclusion: PRACtical offers a robust solution to Rowhammer vulnerabilities with enhanced performance and energy efficiency while maintaining the security guarantees of PRAC+ABO.

Abstract: As DRAM density increases, Rowhammer becomes more severe due to heightened
charge leakage, reducing the number of activations needed to induce bit flips.
The DDR5 standard addresses this threat with in-DRAM per-row activation
counters (PRAC) and the Alert Back-Off (ABO) signal to trigger mitigation.
However, PRAC adds performance overhead by incrementing counters during the
precharge phase, and recovery refreshes stalls the entire memory channel, even
if only one bank is under attack.
  We propose PRACtical, a performance-optimized approach to PRAC+ABO that
maintains the same security guarantees. First, we reduce counter update latency
by introducing a centralized increment circuit, enabling overlap between
counter updates and subsequent row activations in other subarrays. Second, we
enhance the $RFM_{ab}$ mitigation by enabling bank-level granularity: instead
of stalling the entire channel, only affected banks are paused. This is
achieved through a DRAM-resident register that identifies attacked banks.
  PRACtical improves performance by 8% on average (up to 20%) over the
state-of-the-art, reduces energy by 19%, and limits performance degradation
from aggressive performance attacks to less than 6%, all while preserving
Rowhammer protection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shop-R1, an RL framework aimed at improving LLMs' reasoning abilities for online shopping behavior simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLMs' capability in reasoning and action prediction, especially in generating realistic human-like behavior in web environments.

Method: Shop-R1 decomposes the task into rationale generation and action prediction. It uses self-supervised signals for reasoning and a hierarchical reward structure for action refinement.

Result: Shop-R1 achieved a 65% relative improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves human-like reasoning and behavior simulation, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DG-PRM, a method for dynamic and generalizable reward modeling for Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) struggle with cross-domain generalization, static evaluation, and coarse-grained criteria when guiding LLMs.

Method: The proposed DG-PRM uses a reward tree for fine-grained criteria storage and Pareto dominance estimation for identifying effective reward pairs.

Result: DG-PRM significantly improves LLM performance on benchmarks and demonstrates strong adaptability to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DG-PRM enhances reward modeling with dynamic selection and generalizability, excelling in dense task rewards and cross-domain application.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of formulating bias-free analytical questions for users without a statistical background, as existing research primarily focuses on text-to-SQL accuracy rather than cognitive biases.

Method: The paper introduces three innovations: a contextual semantic mapping framework for bias detection, an analytical framework based on the Hard-to-Vary principle, and an optimized LLM-powered system for generating task-specific prompts using feedback mechanisms.

Result: User testing showed 82.5% positive impact on analytical quality, and in comparative evaluations, VeriMinder outperformed alternatives by at least 20% in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriMinder helps users avoid biased or poorly-formulated questions during data analysis, is accessible as an MIT-licensed open-source tool, and encourages further community adoption and research.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel end-to-end Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) system capable of processing multi-part test responses efficiently, achieving strong performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance efficiency and scalability of automatic speaking assessments for second-language multi-part tests, while reducing complexity and resource usage.

Method: The system employs a Whisper-small encoder to process four spoken responses, utilizes a lightweight aggregator for score prediction, and eliminates the need for transcription or per-part models.

Result: The proposed system achieves a RMSE of 0.384, improving over a text-based baseline's RMSE of 0.44, with a lightweight architecture using only 70% of Whisper-small parameters.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practicality for large-scale language learning systems, showcasing efficiency in training with smaller datasets and better handling of imbalanced data classes.

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [30] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates six AI detection tools' ability to identify text generated by the novel LLM DeepSeek, emphasizing the impact of adversarial techniques like paraphrasing and humanization on detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to assess the robustness of AI detection technologies against adversarially crafted machine-generated text, focusing on the underexplored DeepSeek LLM.

Method: The study tested six AI detection tools on 49 original DeepSeek-generated and human-written texts, expanded with 196 samples via paraphrasing and humanization techniques, and evaluated the detectors' performance with few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect accuracy on unaltered text but suffered accuracy drops under humanization attacks. Few-shot learning with DeepSeek achieved high recall rates, misclassifying only one sample.

Conclusion: While certain AI detectors like QuillBot and Copyleaks perform well against simple text manipulations, robustness against humanization remains a challenge. DeepSeek demonstrated strong detection capability through few-shot prompting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether larger language models align better with Bayesian updating principles when presented with evidence, introducing a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric to measure this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore if larger and more advanced language models are better at updating beliefs consistent with Bayes' theorem, enhancing their theoretical understanding.

Method: The researchers formulate a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and develop a specialized dataset to measure the BCC across multiple pre-trained language models from five families.

Result: Larger and more capable pre-trained language models were found to align more closely with Bayes' theorem, evidenced by better BCC scores.

Conclusion: This study has important implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of language models and improving their governance.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

### [34] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuralDB, a framework for editing knowledge in large language models (LLMs) that preserves their overall abilities while handling up to 100,000 edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient and scalable knowledge editing in large language models without compromising their general abilities or performance.

Method: The authors propose NeuralDB, which represents edited facts as a neural Key-Value database and uses a gated retrieval module to engage edits only when necessary, thus avoiding interference with general model abilities.

Result: NeuralDB effectively edits and preserves up to 100,000 facts while maintaining model performance across various language tasks. It outperforms existing methods in terms of editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency.

Conclusion: NeuralDB is a scalable and effective solution for knowledge editing in LLMs, allowing significant knowledge updates without diminishing their general capacities or task performance.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [35] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS, a gradient-based inference-time steering method for language and vision-language models, modifies model activations using attributions to improve performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time steering methods can enable lightweight updates to large models without retraining, addressing tasks where fine-tuning is impractical.

Method: GrAInS utilizes contrastive gradient-based attribution to identify influential tokens and steers activations by constructing directional vectors, adjusting transformer layers in real-time.

Result: GrAInS improves accuracy, reduces hallucination rates, and aligns model outputs better than fine-tuning or existing baselines, showing gains in benchmarks like TruthfulQA and MMHal-Bench.

Conclusion: GrAInS offers interpretable, modular, and scalable control over large model behavior at inference, outperforming other methods while maintaining general model capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, reducing reliance on manual annotation and addressing variability challenges in the speech domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to phrase break prediction heavily depend on extensive human annotations, which are costly and inconsistent due to inherent variability in speech driven by phonetic factors.

Method: Utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, compared these with traditional annotations, and assessed their effectiveness across multiple languages.

Result: LLM-based synthetic data generation successfully reduces annotation challenges and demonstrates effectiveness in phrase break prediction tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a promising alternative to traditional annotation methods for the speech domain, aiding in data generation and addressing critical challenges in phrase break prediction.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces metrics to assess the diversity and privacy of text-based synthetic data from Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing limitations in diversity and privacy preservation, and proposes prompt-based enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data generated by LLMs offers scalability and cost benefits for model training, but its diversity and privacy risks are insufficiently studied.

Method: A set of metrics were developed to evaluate synthetic data diversity (expression, sentiment, perspective) and privacy (re-identification risks, stylistic outliers) in text, coupled with experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: The study highlighted that current LLMs have notable deficiencies in producing synthetic data that is both diverse and privacy-preserving.

Conclusion: A prompt-based approach was proposed to improve the diversity of synthetic text data while ensuring reviewer privacy.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TELEVAL, a benchmark to evaluate spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese conversational scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for SLMs often fail to assess their performance in real-world conversational settings, particularly how users interact naturally.

Method: TELEVAL evaluates SLMs using a dialogue format consistent with real-world usage, focusing on explicit semantics, paralinguistic and implicit semantics, as well as system abilities.

Result: Experiments show that existing SLMs have significant gaps in handling real-world conversational tasks effectively.

Conclusion: TELEVAL aims to provide a user-centered evaluation framework to better measure and advance SLMs' capability in dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and introduces a novel hybrid strategy combining features from BOFT and LoRA-GA for enhancing large language model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory bottlenecks of fine-tuning large language models.

Method: A hybrid fine-tuning method was introduced, combining BOFT’s orthogonal stability and LoRA-GA’s rapid convergence, and adaptive updates based on gradient norms were computed. The study also adapted unitary RNN principles to transformers for improving gradient stability.

Result: Empirical evaluations on benchmarks (GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, HumanEval) demonstrated consistent performance improvements with reduced training time and memory usage. The hybrid method approached full fine-tuning accuracy while cutting resource costs.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach provides a scalable and efficient fine-tuning solution for real-world application of LLMs under constrained resources.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces updated 2024 English GloVe models, improving on the original 2014 GloVe embeddings for evolving linguistic and cultural relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Languages and the world have evolved since 2014, necessitating updated word embeddings for current usage. Additionally, the previous GloVe models lacked detailed documentation on data and preprocessing, prompting the need for improvement and clarity.

Method: Two sets of word embeddings were trained using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma, and evaluated through vocabulary comparison, direct testing, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

Result: The 2024 GloVe models integrate newer words for cultural and linguistic relevance, perform comparably on tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate better results on temporally dependent NER datasets, such as non-Western newswire data.

Conclusion: The updated 2024 GloVe models provide significant benefits by incorporating current vocabulary relevance and delivering improved performance on certain linguistic tasks, making them a valuable resource for modern NLP.

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM improves spoken language models by considering paralinguistic cues such as dialect, emotion, and speaker characteristics, achieving superior results in diverse speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spoken language models underappreciate speech's non-text elements, such as dialect and emotion, limiting their interaction naturalness.

Method: GOAT-SLM uses a dual-head architecture for linguistic and acoustic modeling, with modular staged training leveraging large-scale speech-text data.

Result: The model excelled in the TELEVAL benchmark, proving balanced performance across semantic and non-semantic tasks and outperforming peers in paralinguistic tasks.

Conclusion: Modeling speech beyond semantics enhances interaction quality, paving the way for more expressive and adaptive AI spoken systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding MLLMs’ capabilities for performing visual operations during multi-modal mathematical reasoning using code as an intermediate representation.

Method: The evaluation framework examines two tasks: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG), which tests the model's ability to construct visualizations, and (2) Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE), which includes Deletion, Modification, and Annotation operations. A mathematical figures dataset with diverse types is used.

Result: Nine popular MLLMs were evaluated, and the results show these models fall far behind human-level performance in conducting precise code-based visual operations.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs, while showing promise, require significant improvements in performing multi-modal mathematical reasoning tasks, especially in generating and editing visualizations via code.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

*Gonzalo Cardenal Antolin,Jacques Fellay,Bashkim Jaha,Roger Kouyos,Niko Beerenwinkel,Diane Duroux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in supporting HIV clinical management, introducing the HIVMedQA benchmark, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming others despite challenges linked to complexity and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored role of LLMs in HIV care, a complex area requiring accurate decision-making tools for clinicians, while tackling issues like accuracy, harm, and user acceptance.

Method: The authors developed the HIVMedQA dataset, featuring clinically relevant questions on HIV management, and evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically-focused LLMs using advanced evaluation metrics and prompt engineering.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro surpassed other models on most dimensions. Complexity led to performance dips, bias issues were noted, and medical fine-tuning or larger model sizes did not consistently improve results.

Conclusion: LLMs hold promise for HIV care but require targeted development and rigorous evaluation to address reasoning challenges, biases, and complex question handling for safe clinical integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

### [44] [Sticking to the Mean: Detecting Sticky Tokens in Text Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18171)
*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of 'sticky tokens' in Transformer-based text embedding models, which distort sentence similarity and degrade model performance. It introduces a detection method and analyzes the root causes and impacts on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the anomalous behavior of sticky tokens that disrupt sentence embeddings' reliability and negatively impact NLP tasks.

Method: The authors propose a novel method called Sticky Token Detector (STD) for efficient detection of sticky tokens using sentence and token filtering. They examine 40 checkpoints across 14 model families to identify and analyze the problematic tokens.

Result: A total of 868 sticky tokens were identified. These tokens are often derived from special or unused vocabulary entries and fragmented multilingual subwords. They were found to significantly affect downstream tasks, showing performance drops of up to 50%.

Conclusion: Sticky tokens disproportionately influence model representations, necessitating improved tokenization strategies and model designs for reliable text embedding applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

### [45] [SCOPE: Stochastic and Counterbiased Option Placement for Evaluating Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18182)
*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) exploit biases in multiple-choice tasks. SCOPE is an evaluation framework designed to equalize biases and enhance fairness in model assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs achieve inflated scores using biases in answer options or labels, raising concerns over their genuine understanding in evaluations.

Method: SCOPE uses a null prompt to estimate a model's position-bias distribution, redistributes answer slots inversely, and avoids placement of similar distractors near the correct answer.

Result: SCOPE consistently improved performance stability and confidence distributions compared to other debiasing methods in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: SCOPE offers a new standard to measure bias and improve the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

*Aline Belloni,Patrick Prieur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on integrating the knowledge management principles of ISO30401 with existing operational and process frameworks like ISO9001 through process modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning knowledge management practices outlined in ISO30401 with operational processes and systems already adhering to ISO9001 standards.

Method: Exploration of how ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems can integrate with operational processes using the SECI model and PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles.

Result: The paper offers insights on aligning Knowledge Management Systems under ISO30401 with organizational workflows, ensuring compatibility and integration with existing systems such as ISO9001.

Conclusion: A structured approach employing the SECI model and PDCA cycles enables effective implementation and integration of ISO30401-compliant systems into traditional operational processes.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

### [48] [Safeguarding RAG Pipelines with GMTP: A Gradient-based Masked Token Probability Method for Poisoned Document Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18202)
*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense that detects and filters adversarially crafted documents to protect Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' reliance on external knowledge opens up vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, necessitating a robust method to secure the retrieval component against poisoned content.

Method: GMTP focuses on identifying impactful tokens via retrievers’ gradient analysis, masking these tokens, and verifying their likelihoods through a Masked Language Model (MLM). Tokens with suspiciously low probabilities are flagged as poisoned.

Result: Experiments confirm GMTP’s efficacy in detecting over 90% of malicious documents while preserving relevant ones, ensuring RAG's performance remains reliable.

Conclusion: GMTP provides an effective and precise solution to mitigate the security risks associated with external document poisoning in RAG frameworks, solidifying their trustworthiness.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

### [49] [Exploring the Impact of Instruction-Tuning on LLM's Susceptibility to Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18203)
*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how instruction-tuning in large language models increases their susceptibility to misinformation provided by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how instruction-tuning impacts the reliability of LLMs, particularly their susceptibility to misinformation.

Method: The study compares instruction-tuned LLMs to base models, analyzing influences like user roles in prompts, misinformation length, and system warnings.

Result: Instruction-tuning makes LLMs more reliant on user-provided data, leading to increased acceptance of misinformation compared to base models.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning enhances user interaction but raises challenges regarding misinformation susceptibility, necessitating mitigation strategies for LLM reliability.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

### [50] [Prune&Comp: Free Lunch for Layer-Pruned LLMs via Iterative Pruning with Magnitude Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18212)
*Xinrui Chen,Hongxing Zhang,Fanyi Zeng,Yongxian Wei,Yizhi Wang,Xitong Ling,Guanghao Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune&Comp is a technique addressing the degradation issue in layer-pruned large language models (LLMs) by rescaling remaining weights offline without runtime costs, significantly enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate the performance degradation caused by layer removal in LLMs during layer pruning, enabling both compression and efficient acceleration without sacrificing quality.

Method: Prune&Comp uses offline magnitude compensation to estimate and eliminate the magnitude gap caused by layer removal, supported by an iterative prune-and-compensate loop.

Result: Prune&Comp demonstrated marked improvements in metrics, such as reducing perplexity by half and retaining 93.19% QA performance when pruning layers of LLaMA-3-8B, achieving a 4.01% improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp is an effective, training-free layer pruning scheme that optimally retains performance in large language models, setting a benchmark for future pruning approaches.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Locate-and-Focus method for improved terminology translation in speech translation (ST) by precisely identifying speech clips with terminologies and associating them with translation knowledge from audio and text modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate translation of terminology in speech translation remains a challenge, and existing methods are hindered by irrelevant noise and incomplete utilization of translation knowledge.

Method: The proposed method locates speech clips with terminologies to minimize noise and associates translation knowledge with audio and text data to enhance focus during translation.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show enhanced terminology translation success rates and consistent general translation performance.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective solution for locating and translating terminologies in ST while maintaining overall translation robustness.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

*Nevidu Jayatilleke,Nisansa de Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores OCR performance for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) using six OCR engines, evaluating their zero-shot capabilities on Sinhala and Tamil scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in OCR development for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) with unique scripts, unlike the well-established OCR solutions for High-Resourced Languages (HRL) like English.

Method: Six OCR engines (commercial and open-source) were tested for LRL script recognition using accuracy measurements at the character and word levels. Sinhala was analyzed across all engines, while Tamil used a subset due to limitations.

Result: Surya showed top performance for Sinhala (WER of 2.61%) and Document AI excelled for Tamil (CER of 0.78%). A novel synthetic Tamil OCR dataset was also introduced for benchmarking.

Conclusion: The study highlights strengths of specific OCR engines for LRL, demonstrating varied performances among systems and providing valuable benchmarks for future LRL OCR development.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to incorporate stylistic personalization into instruction-following models, enabling robust brand voice customization without task performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of adapting language models to specific stylistic traits like brand voice or authorial tone, which is essential for enterprise communication but hard to achieve due to lack of paired data.

Method: The proposed framework trains LoRA adapters using diverse unstructured stylistic datasets on a base model, then merges these adapters with a separate instruction-following model.

Result: Experiments across diverse models and datasets show enhanced stylistic consistency while maintaining the model's ability to follow instructions, with human evaluations verifying successful stylistic adaptation.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM provides an efficient solution for stylistic personalization in large language models, balancing customization with high task performance.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

*Biao Yi,Zekun Fei,Jianing Geng,Tong Li,Lihai Nie,Zheli Liu,Yiming Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of "overthinking backdoors," a novel attack affecting large reasoning models (LRMs), enabling attackers to control reasoning verbosity without affecting output correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a previously unexplored vulnerability in LRMs, focusing on their extensive chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities.

Method: The method involves a tunable backdoor attack implemented via data poisoning, where the reasoning verbosity is manipulated by a trigger that controls redundant refinement steps.

Result: Results validate that the attack effectively increases reasoning verbosity across various LRMs while maintaining final answer correctness.

Conclusion: The introduced attack creates a resource-consumption concern for LRMs and proves to be a stealthy, controllable mechanism, demonstrating a new vector of attacks in AI reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses gender bias in machine translation models and highlights issues in translating sentences with ambiguous gender cues. Models should maintain uncertainty about ambiguous gender contexts and explore recently proposed metrics of semantic uncertainty to address the problem effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address biased behavior in MT models that rely on stereotypes for gender inference when translating sentences requiring gender specification.

Method: The authors utilize recently proposed metrics of semantic uncertainty to analyze translation models. They evaluate gender accuracy in unambiguous cases and assess how models maintain uncertainty in ambiguous contexts.

Result: The study reveals that models with high accuracy on unambiguous gender translation fail to demonstrate appropriate uncertainty in ambiguous cases. Debiasing techniques were shown to have independent effectiveness on ambiguous and unambiguous instances.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improved strategies that ensure MT models can accurately infer gender when evident and maintain uncertainty when ambiguous, addressing bias and improving fairness in gender-related translations.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TDR, a framework designed to improve the example retrieval process in in-context learning for large language models, tackling issues related to task-specific data distributions and feedback integration from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current in-context learning processes struggle with retrieving high-quality example sets due to challenges in defining cross-task boundaries and utilizing LLM feedback for refinement.

Method: TDR decouples examples by task and employs fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise retriever training, enhancing example quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on 30 NLP tasks showed TDR achieving consistent improvements and state-of-the-art performance in example retrieval effectiveness.

Conclusion: TDR proves to be an effective and versatile enhancement to LLMs' example retrieval capabilities in in-context learning, offering plug-and-play compatibility for different LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining human expertise and Large Language Models (LLMs) for improving propaganda detection on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the challenges in propaganda detection due to the complexity of the task and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets.

Method: The use of a hierarchical taxonomy for classification, LLM-assisted pre-annotation for labeling and explanation generation, and training smaller language models via knowledge distillation using LLM-generated data.

Result: Significant improvements in annotation consistency, scalability, and time-efficiency, along with successful fine-tuning of smaller language models using high-quality LLM output.

Conclusion: The research introduces a scalable and robust system for propaganda detection, contributing to transparent and accountable media ecosystems aligned with SDG 16.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [58] [CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392)
*Asaf Yehudai,Lilach Eden,Yotam Perlitz,Roy Bar-Haim,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLEAR, a tool for in-depth, LLM-based error analysis and interactive evaluation dashboards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of actionable insights provided by conventional LLM evaluation metrics, which focus on single scores or rankings.

Method: The authors developed CLEAR, an open-source package that provides per-instance feedback, identifies system-level error issues, quantifies their frequency, and offers visual and interactive analysis through a dashboard.

Result: CLEAR was applied to RAG and Math benchmarks, and its effectiveness was demonstrated through a user case study.

Conclusion: CLEAR provides a more granular and actionable way to evaluate the performance of large language models, enhancing transparency and user understanding.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

*Silvia Cappa,Lingxiao Kong,Pille-Riin Peet,Fanfu Wei,Yuchen Zhou,Jan-Christoph Kalo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-lingual inconsistencies in tables across different language versions of Wikipedia and introduces a methodology to analyze these discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address factual inconsistencies and their implications on Wikipedia's reliability, neutrality, and AI systems trained on its data.

Method: Developed a methodology to collect, align, and categorize inconsistencies in tabular data across multilingual Wikipedia articles, using both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Result: Analysis provided insights into the nature of multilingual alignment and inconsistencies in Wikipedia's tabular data.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for improving factual verification and multilingual knowledge interaction, benefiting Wikipedia's reliability and AI applications.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

*Giorgos Iacovides,Wuyang Zhou,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinDPO introduces a finance-specific LLM framework leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to overcome the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, achieving superior sentiment analysis performance and practical applications in portfolio strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online finance-related opinions significantly influence trading decisions and market movements, highlighting the need for advanced sentiment analysis tools that can generalize to unseen events and domain-specific financial language.

Method: The paper introduces FinDPO, a framework that employs Direct Preference Optimization for a post-training human preference alignment of large language models tailored for finance-specific sentiment analysis.

Result: FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming supervised fine-tuned models by 11% on sentiment benchmarks, and demonstrates significant positive annual returns of 67% with a Sharpe ratio of 2.0 in realistic portfolio simulations.

Conclusion: FinDPO effectively addresses the limitations of existing sentiment analysis in finance by providing a framework that is both performance-optimized and practically adaptable for use in realistic trading strategies.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

### [61] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable is a newly introduced Arabic tabular data benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning capabilities, highlighting existing cognitive limitations in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of Arabic tabular benchmarks for evaluating the structured data reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Method: AraTable offers tasks like direct question answering and fact verification, using a hybrid pipeline with LLM-generated content refined by human verification.

Result: LLMs display adequate performance on simple tabular tasks but struggle with deeper reasoning and fact verification on Arabic data.

Conclusion: AraTable facilitates the development and evaluation of LLMs on Arabic data while revealing opportunities for enhancing complex task performance.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Method: Utilized transformer-based models and constructed a large, diverse training corpus with data augmentation for better performance.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 97.1% on News, 91.2% on Reference, and 90.2% on ASR test sets, showing strong generalization in noisy, real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration, releasing datasets and code for future low-resource NLP research.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

*Basel Alshaikhdeeb,Ahmed Abdelmonem Hemedan,Soumyabrata Ghosh,Irina Balaur,Venkata Satagopam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study reviews synthetic medical text generation, identifying its growing use since 2018 for tasks like text augmentation and privacy preservation. Predominant methods involve transformer architectures, especially GPTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address issues of data sparsity and privacy in clinical NLP by examining synthetic text generation methods.

Method: A systematic review was conducted across multiple databases, analyzing papers on synthetic medical free-text generation. Research questions included its purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods.

Result: 94 relevant articles were identified, revealing that GPT-based transformers are commonly used, with evaluation focusing on utility, privacy, structure, and similarity.

Conclusion: Synthetic medical text is beneficial for NLP tasks and overcoming data issues, but privacy concerns persist. Further advances can streamline workflows and regulatory challenges.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraDe, a graph-based modification of LLMs for improved tabular data modeling by focusing on sparse feature dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tabular data due to diluted attention on critical feature relationships, which are sparse and structurally significant.

Method: GraDe integrates graph-guided dynamic learning into LLMs' attention mechanism to prioritize relevant feature interactions using externally extracted functional dependencies.

Result: Experiments show GraDe improves performance by up to 12% on complex datasets and achieves competitive results in synthetic data quality.

Conclusion: GraDe provides an effective, minimally intrusive solution for structure-aware tabular data representation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GIIFT, a framework for improving multimodal machine translation (MMT) by using multimodal scene graphs and inductive learning to refine translation performance without relying on visual cues during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMT methods struggle to leverage visual-linguistic modality gaps effectively and are limited to trained domains with images during inference.

Method: The paper proposes multimodal scene graphs and GIIFT, a two-stage framework that uses a Graph Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified space and generalize it to broader, image-free translation domains.

Result: GIIFT achieves state-of-the-art results on the Multi30K dataset for English-to-French and English-to-German tasks, and outperforms baselines on the WMT benchmark in image-free settings.

Conclusion: GIIFT demonstrates the potential of multimodal scene graphs and inductive learning for enhancing translation accuracy in broader, image-free domains, overcoming prior MMT limitations.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid tokenization method combining 6-mer tokenization and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600) for better DNA Language Model (DLM) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current k-mer tokenization faces challenges in capturing global DNA sequence context and suffers from uneven token distribution.

Method: The research merges unique 6-mer tokens with BPE-600 tokens to create a balanced, context-aware vocabulary for DNA sequence learning.

Result: The DLM, trained using this hybrid tokenization, achieved improved prediction accuracies, surpassing existing models like NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

Conclusion: Advanced tokenization methods are vital for improving DNA modeling and offer promising applications for future biological research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing WINO, a training-free decoding algorithm for Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) that reduces the quality-speed trade-off, achieving faster inference and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the quality-speed trade-off issue in DLLMs, where faster parallel decoding deteriorates performance due to the irreversibility of standard decoding and early error accumulation.

Method: WINO uses a draft-and-verify mechanism to enable revokable decoding in DLLMs by aggressively generating multiple tokens and verifying their correctness using bidirectional context.

Result: WINO improves both speed and accuracy in DLLMs, achieving up to 6× faster inference and 2.58% higher accuracy on GSM8K, and a 10× speedup with improved performance on Flickr30K.

Conclusion: WINO provides a practical and effective way to enhance the efficiency and quality of DLLMs, establishing it as a valuable method for addressing limitations in parallel generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AQuilt, a cost-effective framework to enhance language model performance in specialized domains by generating instruction-tuning data from unlabeled sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often struggle to perform well in specialized domains, and existing methods to tackle this issue are either computationally expensive or fail to generalize well across tasks.

Method: The authors propose AQuilt, a framework that uses logic, self-inspection, and customizable instructions to generate high-quality instruction-tuning data for specialized domains.

Result: AQuilt produces a dataset of 703,000 examples to train a data synthesis model that achieves performance comparable to DeepSeek-V3 at just 17% of its cost.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness in improving domain-specific task performance while significantly reducing computational costs and increasing relevance to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

TL;DR: TRPrompt unifies heuristic and training-based optimization techniques for crafting better prompts for LLMs by using textual feedback as a reward, improving reasoning abilities in models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prompt optimization methods for LLMs, incorporating better reasoning abilities without requiring model parameter updates or large-scale dataset collections.

Method: Introduces the TRPrompt framework, leveraging textual feedback to iteratively train a prompt model. It combines aspects of heuristic textual feedback and numerical reward-based training.

Result: TRPrompt yields state-of-the-art performance for query-specific prompts in challenging datasets like GSMHard and MATH.

Conclusion: Textual rewards enable more effective training of prompt models, combining the strengths of heuristic and reward-based approaches, leading to significant gains in LLM performance.

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF) to improve language models' adherence to instructions using checklist-based evaluation and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the instruction-following ability of language models by introducing flexible, instruction-specific feedback criteria, rather than relying solely on fixed evaluation metrics.

Method: The method involves extracting checklists from instructions, evaluating fulfillment of each checklist item through AI judges and verifier programs, and computing rewards for the reinforcement learning process based on these scores.

Result: RLCF demonstrated improved performance over other methods on five benchmarks, including notable improvements of 4 points on FollowBench, 6 points on InFoBench, and 3 points in win rate on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: This work establishes checklist feedback as an effective tool for enhancing the ability of language models to handle diverse and complex instruction queries.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a decoder-only model for high-quality image generation, excelling in various tasks with unmatched flexibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and improve the autoregressive paradigm for image generation, overcoming limitations of hybrid architectures and pretrained dependencies.

Method: Developed an entirely standalone decoder-only autoregressive model with a unified tokenization scheme for multi-task capabilities, incorporating new decoding strategies for better speed and quality.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results in text-to-image benchmarks (GenEval, DPG), surpassed some diffusion models, and excelled in multi-tasking (Graph200K benchmark).

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a robust and flexible model for unified multimodal generation, offering architectural freedom and high performance, with openly available resources.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,

*Qianyi He,Yuan Chang Leong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model for predicting brain activity (fMRI) in response to multimodal movie stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli like movies.

Method: The method involves a Transformer model that integrates multimodal inputs (visual, auditory, language) using pretrained models (e.g., VideoMAE, HuBERT) and dual cross-attention mechanisms. It autoregressively predicts brain activity while accounting for temporal and subject-specific variability.

Result: The model demonstrates strong predictive performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for accurate prediction of brain activity, paving the way for future advancements in brain-encoding models.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SV3.3B, a 3.3 billion parameter lightweight video model that enables efficient on-device sports video analysis by combining novel sampling and self-supervised learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sports video analysis models require intensive computational resources and fail to capture biomechanical transitions crucial for detailed understanding of sports movements.

Method: SV3.3B uses a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction system to select representative frames, a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder for masked denoising objectives, and a fine-tuned LLM decoder for generating sports action descriptions.

Result: SV3.3B achieves superior descriptive performance and higher information density compared to larger models like GPT-4o, with 29.2% improvement in validation metrics on the NSVA basketball dataset.

Conclusion: SV3.3B can deliver efficient and analytically rich sports video analysis, making it a practical solution for on-device applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Detail++, a framework enhancing text-to-image generation for complex prompts by decomposing them into more manageable stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image generation struggles with prompts involving multiple subjects with distinct attributes, necessitating improved methods for better binding and detail management.

Method: Detail++ employs a Progressive Detail Injection strategy, leveraging decomposition into sub-prompts, staged generation, self-attention for layout control, cross-attention for binding, and Centroid Alignment Loss for enhanced attribute consistency.

Result: Experiments on T2I-CompBench and a custom style composition benchmark show Detail++ significantly surpasses existing methods in scenarios with complex prompts involving multiple objects and stylistic elements.

Conclusion: Detail++ is effective in handling complex prompts in text-to-image generation, offering a promising approach to improve global composition and attribute consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in fish detection caused by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols.

Method: The authors harmonized data from 13 diverse datasets into COCO-style annotations, benchmarked 28 detection models using standard metrics, and proposed a CLIP-based model selection framework for adaptive deployment.

Result: Systematic benchmarking revealed the trade-offs between detection accuracy and efficiency across different model architectures, and the CLIP-based zero-shot model selection achieved high performance without ensemble computation.

Conclusion: FishDet-M provides a standardized platform for evaluating fish detection in aquatic scenes, with resources made publicly available to advance underwater computer vision research and applications.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of
accuracy and computational speed when deployed on Field-Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGAs). However, despite these advances, state-of-the-art YOLO-based

*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses the LightningDiT Generative AI model to test fairness in melanoma classifiers and suggests synthetic data as a promising avenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the biases and fairness issues in melanoma detection systems and explore the use of synthetic data for evaluation.

Method: Utilizing the LightningDiT Generative AI model to create synthetic images for testing the fairness of melanoma classifiers.

Result: Fairness testing with synthetic data is promising but becomes challenging when the detection model is trained on a different dataset than that of the synthetic data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential as a new way to evaluate and improve fairness in medical-imaging AI systems using synthetic data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiNAT-IR, a Transformer model using Dilated Neighborhood Attention and a channel-aware module to improve image restoration tasks by balancing local precision and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models face challenges in image restoration due to the computational overhead of self-attention, especially for high-resolution images, prompting the need for efficiency-quality trade-offs.

Method: They introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) to expand receptive fields and balance global and local contexts, combined with a channel-aware module for integrating global context in image restoration.

Result: The proposed DiNAT-IR architecture yields competitive results in image restoration benchmarks, effectively managing diverse low-level vision problems.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR showcases the potential of combining local and global attention mechanisms with channel-aware modules to advance image restoration efficiency and quality trade-offs.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module to improve accuracy in unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation by refining high-resolution features and balancing local-global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle to balance fine-grained local details and global contextual information, causing segmentation errors in complex regions.

Method: The proposed AFR module refines high-resolution features using low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components, and incorporates uncertainty-driven attention to balance local and global information.

Result: The AFR module achieves an improvement of 1.05% mIoU on GTA V to Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes datasets.

Conclusion: AFR effectively enhances segmentation accuracy in UDA-SS by addressing the balance between fine-grained and global semantic information while maintaining lightweight integration.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

TL;DR: The study introduces the OPEN dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults, collected during virtual cardiac rehabilitation sessions, achieving up to 81% accuracy in recognizing engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the difficulty in measuring engagement in virtual group settings for older adults, particularly in telehealth and virtual learning, an area with limited datasets and research compared to younger populations.

Method: The OPEN dataset was collected from 11 older adults in weekly virtual learning sessions, incorporating facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, and annotated with engagement, affective, behavioral, and contextual labels. Machine learning models were trained to evaluate engagement recognition capabilities.

Result: The researchers achieved up to 81% accuracy in engagement recognition using multiple AI models, demonstrating the dataset's utility for personalized AI-driven engagement analysis for older adults.

Conclusion: The OPEN dataset provides a robust and scalable resource for advancing engagement recognition research, particularly for aging populations, with strong potential for applications in virtual education and telehealth.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated video analysis system to monitor bearded dragon behaviors using YOLO object detection models, achieving reliable basking detection but facing challenges with hunting detection due to poor cricket detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the time-consuming and error-prone nature of traditional monitoring methods for bearded dragon behavior by introducing a scalable, automated system.

Method: The study utilized five YOLO variants trained on a custom dataset of 1200 images. YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model, and the system applied interpolation and rule-based logic to classify behaviors in video footage.

Result: Reliable basking detection with high accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) was achieved, but hunting detection was less accurate due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).

Conclusion: This automated monitoring system improves research efficiency and data quality by reliably detecting basking behavior. Enhancements in cricket detection are required for better hunting behavior classification.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations of existing Re-ID tools that focus only on ground-level perspectives, which suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and obstructions in surveillance tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a large dataset (AG-VPReID.VIR) combining UAV-mounted and fixed CCTV camera footage in RGB and infrared modalities, and propose TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture utilizing style-robust feature learning, memory-based adaptation, and intermediary-guided temporal modeling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that AG-VPReID.VIR poses unique challenges compared to existing datasets. The TCC-VPReID framework achieves significant performance improvements under varied evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The dataset and architecture proposed in this work address critical gaps in cross-modality and cross-platform Re-ID systems, paving the way for more effective 24-hour surveillance capabilities.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of label bias on subgroup performance and feature representation in medical imaging AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the understudied issue of label bias in medical imaging datasets, especially its impact on fairness in medical AI.

Method: Deep learning models were trained for tissue density classification using EMBED with simulated label bias on separable and non-separable subgroups. Performance shifts were analyzed.

Result: Label bias caused significant shifts in feature representation, and subgroup performance was heavily affected by the size, separability, and quality of validation set labels.

Conclusion: Label bias has complex impacts on feature learning and subgroup performance, raising concerns about fairness, particularly in medical imaging AI systems.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [88] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first explicit and optimizable cost function for affine Grassmannian features, addressing limitations in distance measurement under rigid body transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the theoretical advantages of the affine Grassmannian in measuring proximity between features, existing methods lack an explicit optimizable distance function for rigid body transformations, limiting practical applications like registration problems.

Method: The authors derive an explicit cost function that directly minimizes geodesic distance on the manifold by transforming high-dimensional subspace bases. They extend it to an inlier-set-maximizing Branch-and-Bound (BnB) solver.

Result: The proposed method showed improved convergence and performance over existing solutions in various computer vision tasks, with demonstrated global optimality.

Conclusion: This advancement provides a practical optimizable cost function for registration problems, enhancing accuracy and optimization in tasks requiring affine Grassmannian-based proximity measurement.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

*Jake R. Patock,Nicole Catherine Lewis,Kevin McCoy,Christina Gomez,Canling Chen,Lorenzo Luzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces improvements to the Contrastive Captioner (CoCa) model, showing significant performance gains in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models like CoCa trail behind large language models in architectural enhancements despite their strong performance. The paper seeks to bridge this gap by incorporating LLM-inspired modifications into the CoCa model.

Method: GRR-CoCa integrates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into both the textual decoders and vision transformer encoder. These changes are benchmarked against a baseline CoCa model using standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows.

Result: GRR-CoCa outperformed the baseline CoCa model with improvements of 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss during pretraining. Fine-tuning also showed average improvements of 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss across three datasets.

Conclusion: The architectural modifications in GRR-CoCa enhance performance and adaptability in vision-language domains, bridging the gap with advanced LLMs.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

TL;DR: The paper presents Celeb-DF++, a new large-scale, diverse DeepFake dataset aimed at improving generalizable forensics by tackling the challenge of detecting unseen DeepFake types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing diversity of DeepFake videos online necessitates better datasets to enable generalizable detection across various forgery types, addressing the limitations of existing datasets.

Method: The authors expanded their existing Celeb-DF dataset into Celeb-DF++ by incorporating three forgery scenarios (Face-swap, Face-reenactment, Talking-face) and 22 recent DeepFake generation methods. New evaluation protocols for detection methods are proposed.

Result: Celeb-DF++ offers high-quality forged videos across diverse methods, enabling the assessment of 24 detection models and revealing their limitations when handling the dataset's challenges.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++ serves as a benchmark for the development and evaluation of generalizable DeepFake detection models, encouraging advances in forensics against unseen forgery types.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework to reconstruct complete 3D scenes using sparse inpainted views, with automatic mask refinement and uncertainty-guided optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in inpainting 3D scenes while maintaining multi-view consistency and handling the irregular nature of 3D structures.

Method: The method involves automatic mask refinement using operations such as Gaussian scene filtering and back-projection, along with an uncertainty-guided fine-grained optimization strategy for multi-view consistency.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and multi-view consistency across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for high-quality 3D scene inpainting, resolving multi-view inconsistencies and irregular structural challenges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in emotion detection by exploring the use of body movements instead of facial or physiological methods.

Method: The paper categorizes methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, offering a unified taxonomy across four paradigms and benchmarking results.

Result: Comprehensive insights into datasets, techniques, benchmarks, and their extended applications in mental health are presented.

Conclusion: Skeleton-based methods hold promise for emotion recognition, but challenges and future research must address gaps in datasets and technical approaches.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: ViGText integrates visual data and Vision Large Language Model-generated textual explanations into a graph-based framework using Graph Neural Networks for superior deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The threat posed by deepfake technology to the authenticity of digital media and the struggle of traditional detection approaches to handle sophisticated and customized deepfakes.

Method: ViGText uses a combination of image patches, text graphs, and Graph Neural Networks, incorporating multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains for detection.

Result: ViGText achieves significant performance boosts in deepfake detection, with average F1 scores rising from 72.45% to 98.32%, 11.1% higher recall, and robustness limiting classification degradation to less than 4%.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new benchmark for deepfake detection by integrating detailed explanations with visual data, ensuring media authenticity and improving detection capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset for enhancing AI models' abilities to handle multi-scene text-to-video tasks, overcoming limitations in coherent scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI video models struggle with coherent scene transitions in longer videos as they lack mechanisms to identify transitions based on prompts.

Method: The authors developed the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset, which includes preprocessed multi-scene video clips for post-training to address transition understanding challenges.

Result: Post-training on the TAV dataset improved the AI models' understanding of scene transitions based on prompts, enhanced alignment between required and generated content, and preserved video quality.

Conclusion: The TAV dataset addresses the limitations of existing single-scene video datasets, enabling more effective multi-scene video generation with improved scene coherence and transition awareness.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome artifacts in depth discontinuities caused by limitations of depth estimation in previous lens blur rendering methods.

Method: Employs physics-inspired self-attention aligning with image formation, incorporates depth constraints and occlusion effects, and adapts diffusion models for one-step inference without noise.

Result: Achieves blur rendering outcomes of high quality and fidelity by synthesizing scalable and photorealistic data.

Conclusion: BokehDiff offers a novel and effective solution for producing visually and physically realistic lens blur by utilizing generative diffusion priors.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance low-light images by incorporating semantic guidance from normal-light images and text descriptions, addressing limitations in existing methods.

Method: Proposed VLM-IMI integrates textual cues using cross-modal priors, employing iterative and manual refinement of instructions for semantically informed image restoration.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior visual quality and metrics.

Conclusion: VLM-IMI's integration of text-based enhancement cues and iterative strategies offers a robust solution for low-light image enhancement, with openly shared source code.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in maintaining reliable VPR performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints, which are critical for effective mobile robot localization.

Method: The proposed framework includes the DSFormer, a transformer-based module for cross-learning between dual-scale CNN features and self-attention mechanisms for spatial and semantic details. A block clustering strategy reorganizes the SF-XL dataset to improve data efficiency and robustness.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced methods like DELG and TransVPR, while reducing training data by ~30% and boosting computational efficiency using 512-dim global descriptors.

Conclusion: The novel DSFormer framework and block clustering strategy deliver robust, efficient VPR solutions adaptable to environmental changes and outperform existing methods in performance and resource optimization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scenethesis, a novel system for generating 3D software based on user specifications, utilizing a domain-specific intermediate language to improve accuracy and control under complex constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper stems from the under-explored area of 3D software generation and the limitations of current methods, which cannot modify individual elements and struggle with spatial and semantic constraints.

Method: The paper proposes Scenethesis, which uses a domain-specific language (ScenethesisLang) as an intermediate representation that translates user requirements into accurate 3D software generation, decomposing the process into stages for better control and constraint handling.

Result: The evaluation shows that Scenethesis captures over 80% of user requirements, satisfies over 90% of hard constraints, and handles over 100 constraints simultaneously, with a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Scenethesis offers a robust solution for precise 3D software generation, addressing current limitations and setting a new standard in the domain by maintaining accuracy, constraint satisfaction, and user-specific customization.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: This study introduces TextSAM-EUS, a lightweight adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), using text-driven prompts to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in endoscopic ultrasound images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer prognosis is poor and segmentation challenges in endoscopic ultrasound limit the utility of fully supervised deep learning models.

Method: TextSAM-EUS utilizes a text encoder (BiomedCLIP) with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM, leveraging text prompt learning for segmentation tasks with minimal parameter tuning.

Result: TextSAM-EUS achieved 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD using automatic prompts, and 83.10% Dice with 85.70% NSD using manual geometric prompts, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS offers a robust, efficient solution for EUS-based tumor segmentation, marking a significant development by incorporating prompt learning in medical image processing.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dynamic facial expression recognition suffer from performance degradation caused by sample heterogeneity and individual expression variability.

Method: Two modules are proposed: the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) for enhanced temporal and frequency modeling, and the Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) for adaptive optimization balancing classification and contrastive losses.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior recognition accuracy and robustness on datasets DFEW and FERV39k, improving metrics like weighted and unweighted average recall.

Conclusion: HDF addresses heterogeneity challenges effectively, enhancing both performance and generalization in dynamic facial expression recognition tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the

### [103] [Distributional Uncertainty for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18106)
*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, Free-Energy Posterior Network, for detecting out-of-distribution samples and misclassified regions by jointly modeling distributional and data uncertainty using free energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty estimation methods fail to fully align with the semantic requirements of out-of-distribution detection, often focusing solely on either model or data uncertainty.

Method: The method comprises (1) a free-energy-based density estimator using Beta distribution to achieve fine-grained uncertainty estimation and (2) a loss function integrated into a posterior network for direct uncertainty estimation from learned parameters, avoiding stochastic sampling.

Result: The approach results in semantically meaningful and computationally efficient uncertainty-aware segmentation while learning OoD regions through variance of the Beta distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness on challenging real-world benchmarks, advancing OoD detection with improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2VWorldBench, an evaluation framework for assessing text-to-video models' ability to generate videos consistent with world knowledge. Results showed major limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in evaluating text-to-video (T2V) models' ability to employ world knowledge for semantic consistency and factual accuracy in their generated videos.

Method: They developed T2VWorldBench, a benchmark evaluating videos across 6 categories, 60 subcategories, and 1,200 prompts, using both human preferences and vision-language models for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of 10 advanced T2V models revealed they largely fail at understanding world knowledge and producing correct videos.

Conclusion: There exists a critical gap in T2V models regarding commonsense reasoning and factual generation, providing opportunities for future research to enhance this capability.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

*Kesheng Wang,Xiaoyu Chen,Chunlei He,Fenfen Li,Xinxin Yu,Dexing Kong,Shoujun Huang,Qi Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-based method for quantifying curve tortuosity in medical imaging, showcasing its effectiveness via meibomian gland atrophy assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, objective metric for tortuosity quantification that improves upon traditional curvature-based methods by incorporating biologically plausible reference curves, addressing a need in medical diagnostics.

Method: The proposed framework uses probability modeling with entropy theory, combines domain transformation of curve data, and compares target curves to reference curves instead of idealized straight lines. Validation was conducted via simulations and patient data.

Result: The method demonstrated stability in simulations and distinguished between Demodex-negative and Demodex-positive patients based on tortuosity-based uniformity, achieving an AUC of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.93.

Conclusion: The framework offers enhanced clinical utility and generalizability for morphological assessments in medical diagnostics, serving as a robust tool for curve tortuosity analysis and pathology evaluation.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose a bidirectional diffusion mechanism for low-light image enhancement that refines feature interaction and corrects reflections for better alignment with human visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unidirectional diffusion methods struggle with complex real-world degradation patterns, causing structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments in low-light image enhancement.

Method: The method introduces bidirectional diffusion training (from low-to-normal light and normal-to-low light) and integrates an adaptive feature interaction block and reflection-aware correction module to improve consistency in degradation learning and image quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and generalizes well across diverse degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that bidirectional modeling and complementary feature refinement lead to enhanced low-light image enhancement performance, producing high-quality images consistent with human perception.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

TL;DR: This paper introduces WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method using wavelet transforms to combine RGB and infrared frequency features, improving object detection performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance object detection by effectively leveraging the complementary characteristics of RGB and infrared imagery, addressing the limitations of individual modalities.

Method: WaveMamba integrates RGB and IR features using wavelet transforms (DWT and IDWT). It features a novel WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB) for frequency sub-bands fusion, advanced attention mechanisms, and a high-frequency fusion strategy.

Result: The proposed method achieves an average mAP improvement of 4.5% across four benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in object detection.

Conclusion: WaveMamba successfully demonstrates the power of wavelet-based cross-modality fusion, enhancing object detection capabilities by leveraging advanced fusion strategies and achieving significant performance gains.

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes addressing domain shifts in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation via a two-stage Unsupervised Domain Adaptation approach involving contrastive pre-training and ensemble pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation caused by domain shifts, as manual annotation of large-scale target domain data is infeasible.

Method: It introduces a two-stage framework: (1) segment-level contrastive pre-training to learn domain-invariant features and (2) multi-model ensemble pseudo-labeling to refine predictions for the target domain.

Result: Experiments from SemanticKITTI to target datasets like SemanticPOSS and SemanticSlamantic show considerable improvement in segmentation accuracy over baseline direct transfer and single-model UDA methods.

Conclusion: Combining contrastive pre-training with ensemble pseudo-labeling effectively bridges domain gaps in 3D LiDAR segmentation without requiring annotations for the target domain.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-UMamba, an enhanced UNet-based architecture that handles noisy data in medical image segmentation using a Noise Reduction Module and achieves improved performance in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often overfit to noise and irrelevant patterns in data-scarce scenarios, limiting their generalization ability, especially in medical image segmentation tasks.

Method: The researchers propose Diff-UMamba, which integrates the UNet architecture with the mamba mechanism for handling long-range dependencies. A Noise Reduction Module (NRM) is added to suppress noisy or irrelevant features during encoding, enhancing task-relevant representations.

Result: The proposed method achieves consistent performance improvements of 1-3% over baseline methods on multiple public datasets (MSD, AIIB23). It also demonstrates a 4-5% improvement on an internal NSCLC dataset for tumor segmentation in cone beam CT.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, making it an effective approach for medical image segmentation, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL is a self-supervised learning architecture for micrograph analysis of metallic materials, showing superior segmentation performance using small-scale unlabeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for micrograph analysis require labeled data and perform inconsistently with few samples. SSL offers potential, but its effectiveness often depends on large datasets.

Method: MatSSL employs Gated Feature Fusion to integrate multi-level representations. Self-supervised pretraining is performed on small-scale unlabeled datasets, followed by fine-tuning on benchmark datasets.

Result: MatSSL achieved 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming an ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and showed nearly 40% improvement on the EBC benchmark compared to MicroNet-pretrained models.

Conclusion: MatSSL demonstrates effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using minimal unlabeled data, while preserving features learned from large-scale natural image pretraining.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeEFusion, a method for efficient text-to-image synthesis using linear fusion of text embeddings, achieving enhanced inference speed without sacrificing image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high inference costs associated with classifier-free guidance (CFG) and complex sampling strategies in text-to-image synthesis.

Method: TeEFusion combines conditional and unconditional text embeddings linearly to replicate guidance and distills complex teacher sampling strategies into a simpler inference process for the student model.

Result: The student model mimics teacher performance with inference speeds up to 6x faster while maintaining comparable image quality.

Conclusion: TeEFusion offers a practical solution for efficient text-to-image generation by significantly reducing inference time without compromising on output quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

*Qilin Huang,Tianyu Lin,Zhiguang Chen,Fudan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF improves medical image segmentation with latent diffusion models, introducing optimization techniques for better performance without altering model architecture or increasing computational demand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for medical image segmentation lack specific adaptations for segmentation tasks and face limitations in feature extraction.

Method: LEAF refines the latent diffusion model by replacing noise prediction with direct segmentation map prediction and leveraging feature distillation to align convolution layer states with transformer-encoder features.

Result: Experimental results validate improved performance across various disease segmentation datasets using LEAF, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: LEAF delivers superior segmentation results without increasing model architecture complexity or inference computational requirements, presenting an optimized approach in medical imaging.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

*Xin Wei,Qin Yang,Yijie Fang,Mingrui Zhu,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Test-time adaptation (TTA) for 3D point clouds faces challenges due to their irregular structure, but this paper introduces a more efficient spectral-domain technique, Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation (GSDTTA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of adapting TTA methods for 3D point clouds where current approaches are computationally expensive and rely on additional training data.

Method: Introduced GSDTTA, which uses graph spectral domain analysis via Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to optimize adaptation by focusing on the lowest frequency components. Additionally, it employs eigenmap-guided self-training to refine spectral adjustments and model parameters iteratively.

Result: GSDTTA showed superior performance and efficiency compared to existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral-domain GSDTTA method demonstrates a more efficient and effective strategy for test-time adaptation on 3D point clouds, reducing computational demands while improving accuracy.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network to address domain gaps and transmission delays in collaborative perception, achieving robust performance and advanced semantic feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception struggles with domain diversity and temporal misalignments that degrade feature quality and overall network effectiveness.

Method: DATA network incorporates three modules: CDAM for domain alignment, PTAM for temporal alignment, and IFAM for enhanced semantic feature aggregation.

Result: DATA achieved state-of-the-art performance across three datasets, proving resilient under challenging conditions like communication delays and pose errors.

Conclusion: The study validates the importance of aligning features systematically for collaborative perception, providing a robust and efficient framework with publicly available code.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

*Longjian Zeng,Zunjie Zhu,Rongfeng Lu,Ming Lu,Bolun Zheng,Chenggang Yan,Anke Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DepthDark, a robust foundation model for monocular depth estimation in low-light environments, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve challenges in monocular depth estimation under low-light conditions due to lack of paired datasets and effective tuning strategies.

Method: The method includes flare and noise simulation modules for dataset creation and a low-light PEFT strategy utilizing illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: DepthDark achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging low-light datasets, demonstrating effectiveness with limited training resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark provides a reliable solution for low-light monocular depth estimation, advancing capability and efficiency in such environments.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

*Zhuoguang Chen,Minghui Qin,Tianyuan Yuan,Zhe Liu,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LONG3R, a model for real-time streaming multi-view 3D scene reconstruction over long sequences, addressing limitations of existing methods like offline optimization and short-sequence constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacies of existing 3D reconstruction methods in handling long sequences of input images in real-time, a more efficient and scalable solution is needed.

Method: The model operates recurrently with a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant data, a dual-source refined decoder for interaction, and a 3D spatio-temporal memory for optimized resolution and pruning of redundant information. A two-stage curriculum training strategy is employed to enhance performance on long sequences while ensuring training efficiency.

Result: LONG3R achieves real-time processing, notably outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, especially for longer sequences.

Conclusion: LONG3R is a significant advancement in streaming 3D reconstruction that balances real-time efficiency and superior performance for long sequences.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

### [117] [Exploiting Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning with Diffusion Priors for Enhanced Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18260)
*Junyao Li,Yahao Lu,Xingyuan Guo,Xiaoyu Xian,Tiantian Wang,Yukai Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of infrared small target detection (ISTD) in scenarios with scarce high-quality infrared data by introducing a new framework focused on Gaussian-based representation learning and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges faced by current ISTD methods, which rely on large, manually-labeled datasets that can fail in real-world conditions, particularly when high-quality data is scarce.

Method: The authors propose Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning, including the Gaussian Group Squeezer for quantization and two-stage diffusion models for better synthetic sample reconstruction aligned with real-world distributions.

Result: The proposed approach significantly enhances ISTD model resilience and improves synthetic data quality. Comparative analyses show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scarcity scenarios.

Conclusion: The suggested method demonstrates superior robustness and effectiveness, offering a reliable solution for ISTD in challenging, data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

*Wenran Zhang,Huihuan Luo,Linda Wei,Ping Nie,Yiqun Wu,Dedong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study investigates the causal relationship between dental diseases (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer, finding evidence for dental caries increasing lung cancer risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to address the uncertainty regarding the causal relationship between oral diseases (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes using genetic analysis.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization was employed, incorporating genome-wide association studies data for dental caries, periodontitis, and lung cancer. Mediation analysis assessed pulmonary function.

Result: A significant causal effect of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes was found. Periodontitis did not show any causal effect. Declines in pulmonary function partially mediated the relationship.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize a causal role of dental caries in lung cancer risk, advocating for strategies combining dental care and pulmonary function monitoring in cancer prevention.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

### [119] [LMM-Det: Make Large Multimodal Models Excel in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18300)
*Jincheng Li,Chunyu Xie,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces LMM-Det, a method to improve object detection capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) without relying on specialized detection modules. The approach involves data distribution adjustment and inference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in object detection performance of large multimodal models compared to specialized detection systems, making LMMs more versatile.

Method: The proposed method, LMM-Det, enhances LMMs' object detection by adjusting data distribution, optimizing inference, and reorganizing instruction conversations, all without requiring additional detection modules.

Result: Experimental results show that LMM-Det improves object detection capabilities of LMMs, enabling high performance akin to specialized systems while retaining multimodal functionalities.

Conclusion: The research concludes that large multimodal models possess inherent object detection capacity, which can be effectively unlocked by the proposed methods without adding external detection components.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

*Xiaomei Zhang,Hanyu Zheng,Xiangyu Zhu,Jinghuan Wei,Junhong Zou,Zhen Lei,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents FieldLVLM, a framework enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for understanding scientific field data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underdevelopment of LVLMs in interpreting complex scientific field data, a gap in their application to natural sciences.

Method: FieldLVLM combines a field-aware language generation strategy to extract key physical features and convert them into textual descriptions, along with data-compressed multimodal model tuning to simplify field inputs.

Result: FieldLVLM demonstrates superior performance on benchmark scientific field data tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This work expands the applicability of LVLMs, bridging large-scale models and domain-specific scientific research tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a benchmark for semi-supervised ECG segmentation, leveraging underused datasets, various algorithms, and architectures for evaluation, concluding that transformers outperform convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated ECG data limits progress in automatic ECG segmentation despite the clinical importance, presenting a need for semi-supervised methods to utilize unlabeled data.

Method: The authors curated datasets, adopted five SemiSeg algorithms, tested them on convolutional and transformer architectures, and introduced ECG-specific training configurations and a standardized evaluation framework.

Result: Transformers outperformed convolutional networks for semi-supervised ECG delineation in both in-domain and cross-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: This benchmark is expected to advance research in semi-supervised ECG delineation, offering resources and evaluation methodologies for future studies.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

### [122] [Beyond Low-rankness: Guaranteed Matrix Recovery via Modified Nuclear Norm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18327)
*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modified nuclear norm (MNN) framework for structured low-rank recovery, improving matrix recovery methods like Robust PCA and matrix completion by integrating global low-rank and local information efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance existing matrix recovery approaches, which often struggle to balance global low-rankness and local details, and lack theoretical guarantees when combining these properties.

Method: The authors introduce the MNN framework, applying transformations to matrices before performing nuclear norm minimization. This approach eliminates the need for trade-off parameter tuning and provides theoretical recovery guarantees under certain conditions.

Result: The proposed method effectively recovers matrices in both Robust PCA and matrix completion tasks, demonstrating theoretical recovery guarantees and outperforming existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The MNN framework offers a versatile and reliable solution for matrix recovery problems by capturing both local and global data structures, with robust theoretical support and proven practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a dataset of contrail videos that identifies and tracks contrails, along with a deep learning framework for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive data on contrail dynamics and their climate impact, especially as existing datasets lack temporal tracking and source-flight attribution.

Method: The authors developed the GVCCS dataset with 122 contrail video sequences, including flight identifiers, and proposed a deep learning framework for contrail segmentation and tracking.

Result: The dataset offers detailed contrail lifecycle analysis, and their model integrates semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and temporal tracking under one unified system.

Conclusion: The GVCCS dataset and proposed framework improve contrail monitoring and model calibration, paving the way for better assessments of aviation’s climate impact.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve upon prior methods for indoor 3D object detection by making voxel features more representative and reducing computational redundancy.

Method: Introduces a geometry and context-aware module for voxel aggregation, and an adaptive sparse volume construction strategy to refine features efficiently.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes datasets.

Conclusion: SGCDet advances 3D object detection by effectively integrating geometric and contextual information and optimizing processing efficiency, validated by benchmark performance.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance bird species classification from song recordings using colorized spectrograms to embed frequency information, yielding significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifying bird species from song recordings is challenging due to environmental noise, overlapping sounds, and missing labels. Traditional models fail in cases with low signal-to-noise ratio or multi-species recordings.

Method: The researchers introduce a technique to embed frequency information into spectrograms using primary color additives, thereby differentiating species with similar motifs when analyzed through deep learning models.

Result: The proposed approach achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy, outperforming the BirdCLEF 2024 winner with a 7.3% increase in F1, 6.2% in ROC-AUC, and 6.6% in CMAP.

Conclusion: Embedding frequency information via colorization in spectrograms enhances bird species classification models, proving to be a highly effective method for tackling audio-based identification challenges in noisy environments.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoExoBench, a benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in egocentric and exocentric video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in MLLMs, their performance in cross-view reasoning between egocentric and exocentric perspectives remains untested.

Method: The authors developed EgoExoBench, comprising 7,300 question-answer pairs across 11 sub-tasks organized into semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning challenges.

Result: Evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals that these models perform well on single-view tasks but struggle with cross-view semantics, view association, and temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench is a valuable resource for advancing research on intelligent systems capable of human-like cross-view reasoning.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Result: VB-Mitigator offers standardized evaluation, comparative analysis, and exposes biases among state-of-the-art methods to promote fairness-aware models.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates research in computer vision bias mitigation and provides best practices to guide future development by unifying tools and methodologies.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various

development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deformable convolutional module, GDCUnet, for fundus blood vessel segmentation, which achieves state-of-the-art results by addressing complex global features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of deformable convolution to handle complex, globally self-similar features such as those found in fundus blood vessels, and improve model performance in segmentation tasks.

Method: The method involves designing a deformable convolutional module that integrates attention and feedforward networks to learn offsets for global feature capture. The module performs sub-pixel displacement rather than direct kernel deformation and is used within the GDCUnet model for blood vessel segmentation.

Result: The proposed model, GDCUnet, achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets for fundus blood vessel segmentation. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the novel deformable convolutional module in learning complex features.

Conclusion: The deformable convolutional module enhances representation and generalization, with potential applicability to other machine vision tasks involving complex, globally self-similar features.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Method: MVG4D combines multi-view synthesis and 4D Gaussian Splatting, utilizing synthesized multi-view images to optimize a 3D point cloud and extend it into the temporal domain using deformation network.

Result: MVG4D outperforms prior methods on metrics like CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and time efficiency, with reduced flickering and improved geometric fidelity.

Conclusion: MVG4D advances efficient and controllable 4D content generation, paving the way for better immersive AR/VR experiences and addressing existing 4D modeling challenges.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

### [131] [Towards Consistent Long-Term Pose Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18382)
*Yayuan Li,Filippos Bellos,Jason Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a one-stage architecture for generating pose sequences directly in continuous coordinate space from an RGB image and text description without intermediate representations, showing improved performance in long-term scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of intermediate representations and autoregressive models that degrade performance in long-term pose generation tasks.

Method: Proposed a single-stage model that uses direct pose coordinate generation with relative movement prediction and unified placeholder token mechanisms for consistency during training and inference.

Result: Tests on Penn Action and F-PHAB datasets showed significant performance improvements over quantization-based and autoregressive methods, particularly in long-term pose generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances spatial relationship preservation and temporal coherence, offering a robust alternative to traditional pose generation methods.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

### [132] [HumanMaterial: Human Material Estimation from a Single Image via Progressive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18385)
*Yu Jiang,Jiahao Xia,Jiongming Qin,Yusen Wang,Tuo Cao,Chunxia Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach to full-body human inverse rendering, leveraging a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF) and a progressive training strategy with the HumanMaterial model to achieve more realistic rendering results, especially for skin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for inverse rendering suffer from limited realism due to simplified datasets and rendering equations. The absence of constraints on material maps also makes the problem ill-posed. This paper aims to address these issues and improve rendering realism.

Method: The authors introduce the OpenHumanBRDF dataset, a high-quality material dataset including additional factors like displacement and subsurface scattering, specifically enhancing skin realism. They propose HumanMaterial, a model with progressive training strategy supported by Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR) loss to refine material estimation.

Result: Experiments on OpenHumanBRDF and real data show that this method achieves state-of-the-art performance in material estimation and rendering realism compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the combination of a higher-quality dataset and an advanced model design significantly improves inverse rendering realism, setting a benchmark for future research in this area.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome Swin Transformer's limitation of needing consecutive blocks for global attention and to introduce a more efficient transformer combining global and local information.

Method: Combines interleaved window attention for long-range token interactions with depthwise separable convolution for local token continuity, allowing hierarchical processing without position embeddings.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K for image classification, and demonstrated efficiency in semantic segmentation and video action recognition.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer is a significant improvement over existing methods, offering strong versatility and potential across various visual tasks, including future research like video generation.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

*Xun Ye,Ruixiang Tang,Mingda Zhang,Jianglong Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFFSNet introduces a novel feature decoupling strategy for medical image segmentation, dynamically balancing multi-scale features and outperforming current models on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in medical image segmentation struggle with integrating connectivity, often leading to coupled feature spaces without a proper quantification mechanism.

Method: DCFFSNet employs a feature space decoupling strategy that quantifies the relative strengths of connectivity features and builds a dynamic multi-scale fusion-separation architecture.

Result: DCFFSNet demonstrated superior performance by achieving higher Dice and IoU scores compared to mainstream models across datasets (ISIC2018, DSB2018, MoNuSeg).

Conclusion: The proposed method resolves segmentation fragmentation, achieves smooth edge transitions, and improves clinical usability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-JEPA, a self-supervised learning approach suitable for ultrasound video data, addressing challenges of noisy pixel-level details and low annotated data availability. It incorporates a novel 3D localization auxiliary task to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring and annotating datasets for ultrasound imaging is difficult due to low contrast, noise, and artifact prevalence. The paper aims to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve segmentation performance, even with limited labeled data.

Method: The study utilizes V-JEPA, an SSL framework for video data based on feature prediction, integrated with a novel 3D localization auxiliary task tailored for vision transformer (ViT)-based models.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant segmentation performance improvements using V-JEPA with the auxiliary task across frozen encoder configurations. Gains reach up to 3.4% for full training data and up to 8.35% for only 10% training data.

Conclusion: V-JEPA, combined with the 3D localization auxiliary task, proves effective for ultrasound video data segmentation and highlights its potential in overcoming limitations of small medical datasets and noisy data.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, NLML-HPE, for head pose estimation using non-linear manifold learning, enabling real-time regression-based estimation even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in existing HPE datasets and overcome challenges related to limited training data in head pose estimation.

Method: The NLML-HPE method utilizes tensor decomposition (Tucker decomposition) and feed-forward neural networks, combined with generating a precise 2D dataset from 3D models.

Result: The model achieves real-time performance and accurately predicts head poses from facial landmarks by learning the rotation manifolds for each axis.

Conclusion: The NLML-HPE approach effectively tackles HPE challenges by providing a robust and fast method, supported by publicly available implementation and datasets.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for enhancing the understanding of driver behavior and aligning large multimodal models (MLLMs) with driving-related tasks, showcasing significant performance improvements through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing datasets in explaining personalized driver behavior and improve safety systems by aligning MLLMs with driving comprehension and reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper provides a benchmark named PDB-Eval, composed of two components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X evaluates temporal driving scene understanding, while PDB-QA focuses on visual explanation through a question-answering task for MLLM fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs using PDB-Eval led to up to 73.2% improvement in zero-shot QA performance and up to 12.5% improvement in intention prediction tasks (Brain4Cars) and 11.0% in recognition tasks (AIDE).

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on PDB-Eval effectively aligns MLLMs' reasoning with driving comprehension tasks, bridging domain gaps, and significantly enhancing their performance on driving-related applications.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standardized framework to enhance adversarial robustness research in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, addressing reproducibility issues in physical attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of reproducibility and practicality in physical adversarial attacks in LiDAR-based 3D object detection.

Method: The authors developed a device-agnostic, open-source framework with benchmarking protocols for evaluating physical adversarial object attacks in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Result: The framework facilitates fair comparisons in research, validates simulated attacks on physical LiDAR systems, and identifies factors affecting attack success.

Conclusion: The work promotes standardized research practices and deepens understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR systems.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynC, a framework designed to enhance Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) by refining synthetic image-caption datasets. SynC reallocates captions to the most semantically aligned images, addressing issues stemming from noisy synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for ZIC datasets is costly, while synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image models often have mismatches between images and captions, impacting training.

Method: SynC employs a one-to-many mapping strategy, retrieving candidate images for captions and uses a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer to select the most semantically aligned image.

Result: SynC significantly improves ZIC model performance on benchmarks like MS-COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps, achieving state-of-the-art outcomes.

Conclusion: SynC provides an effective solution for refining synthetic datasets in ZIC, leveraging semantic alignment strategies to improve model accuracy.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Result: CRUISE delivers high fidelity scene reconstruction, enhances 3D detection and tracking, and creates complex corner cases in V2X data.

Conclusion: CRUISE is a versatile tool for improving V2X-related autonomous driving tasks and datasets, offering significant contributions to the field.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Q-Former Autoencoder, using pretrained vision foundation models for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to the diversity of anomalies and lack of annotated datasets. The authors aim to address this by leveraging pretrained vision models for unsupervised detection.

Method: The authors propose the Q-Former Autoencoder framework, which utilizes frozen vision foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2) as feature extractors and uses a Q-Former bottleneck for reconstruction. A perceptual loss based on Masked Autoencoder guides meaningful reconstructions.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on medical anomaly detection benchmarks like BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that pretrained vision foundation models trained on natural images can generalize effectively to medical anomaly detection without further fine-tuning. The code and models are publicly released.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of reliable malaria detection, especially in developing countries, by overcoming the limited availability of detailed annotated datasets for automated diagnostic methods.

Method: The authors enhanced the NIH malaria dataset with bounding box annotations in COCO format, validated the dataset by training a Faster R-CNN model, and evaluated its performance using cross-validation.

Result: The updated dataset allowed the Faster R-CNN model to achieve an F1 score of up to 0.88 for detecting infected cells, signifying improved accuracy in malaria diagnosis.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of dataset quality in robust detection and presents an automated and manually refined annotation workflow to empower future automated malaria diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Existing defense mechanisms rely on fixed assumptions, making them less effective in dynamic and complex 3D settings.

Method: The proposed Rein-EAD framework uses adaptive exploration and interaction with the 3D environment. It employs a multi-step objective to balance immediate prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization and incorporates an uncertainty-based reward-shaping mechanism for efficient policy updates without requiring differentiable environments.

Result: Rein-EAD substantially reduces the success rates of adversarial attacks while maintaining standard accuracy across various tasks. It demonstrates robust generalization to unseen and adaptive attacks in experiments.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD proves to be an effective and adaptive defense strategy suitable for real-world applications like 3D object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving, addressing existing limitations in handling adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to better utilize map uncertainty in trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, improving performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance and reliability in mapless autonomous driving by addressing uncertain online map generation and its impact on trajectory prediction.

Method: The authors analyze driving scenarios influenced by map uncertainty and propose Proprioceptive Scenario Gating for adaptive integration of map uncertainty. They also introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty method for improved alignment with map geometry.

Result: These methods achieve up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction on the nuScenes dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Insights into kinematic state factors and adaptive uncertainty utilization make the proposed methods more interpretable and effective, advancing mapless autonomous driving capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SemBA-FAST, a top-down framework for predicting human visual attention during target searches. It dynamically generates attention maps using semantic information and artificial foveation, achieving competitive results on human scanpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computational model that mimics human visual attention mechanisms for tasks like visual search, leveraging both semantic information and foveal vision.

Method: SemBA-FAST combines deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic fusion mechanism. It updates knowledge dynamically using artificial foveation and pre-trained detectors to sequentially predict human-like fixations.

Result: SemBA-FAST performed strongly on the COCO-Search18 dataset, surpassing baseline models and other top-down approaches while achieving fixation sequences that align closely with human scanpath data.

Conclusion: The framework enhances our understanding of semantic-foveal frameworks, which could aid real-time cognitive computing and robotics applications by modeling human-like attention.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantitative comparison method for sparse autoencoder (SAE)-derived features across visual, textual, and multimodal encoders. It also quantifies shared features between these encoder types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies compared SAE-derived features within the same modality, but there was no framework for cross-modality comparison.

Method: They propose two novel indicators: a tool for quantitative comparison across SAEs and a measure of Comparative Sharedness for feature overlap among encoder types.

Result: The study analyzed 21 different encoders using the proposed tools, revealing shared representations between visual, textual, and multimodal encoders. Text pretraining impacts visual features specific to VLMs.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the shared features across modalities and the influence of multimodal context. The approach revisits prior studies and offers new insights into encoder sharedness.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

TL;DR: This paper addresses detecting rare bio-digesters in large-scale remote sensing imagery to estimate methane emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the challenge of detecting rare objects in remote sensing imagery, which is essential for applications like environmental impact assessments.

Method: A novel dataset of bio-digesters is introduced and a part-based detection method is developed to enhance the identification process. This approach focuses on bio-digester sub-elements.

Result: The proposed method is applied to unseen regions, successfully building an inventory of bio-digesters and enabling geostatistical estimates of methane emissions.

Conclusion: By combining rare object detection with geostatistical analysis, the study provides a scalable method for monitoring bio-digester-related methane emissions in France.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if foundation models can effectively segment objects in highly cluttered visual scenes, aimed at neuroprosthetic applications.

Method: The authors use gaze fixation-derived prompts with SAM and fine-tune it on egocentric visual data for segmentation.

Result: The approach improved IoU scores by up to 0.51 points on the Grasping-in-the-Wild dataset.

Conclusion: Gaze-guided segmentation using foundation models like SAM shows promise for complex real-world visual scenes, aiding applications such as neuroprostheses.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

TL;DR: This paper introduces GaussianFusionOcc, which uses a 3D Gaussian representation combined with an innovative sensor fusion mechanism for efficient and accurate 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to enhance autonomous driving by improving 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which is essential for precise and safe navigation in complex environments.

Method: The proposed method, GaussianFusionOcc, integrates data from camera, LiDAR, and radar using 3D Gaussian representation and a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism for feature extraction.

Result: GaussianFusionOcc achieves superior memory efficiency and inference speed and demonstrates better performance compared to state-of-the-art models across various sensor combinations.

Conclusion: By employing a robust multi-modal sensor fusion strategy and efficient Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc sets a new standard for accurate and scalable 3D occupancy predictions.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IntentVCNet, an approach enhancing spatio-temporal control in video captioning by unifying LVLMs' spatial and temporal understanding with advanced prompting and model strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved intent-oriented controlled video captioning arises from LVLMs' inability to deliver precise spatial control in time sequences directly based on user instructions.

Method: IntentVCNet uses a novel prompt combination strategy for implicit relationship modeling between user intent prompts and video sequences, alongside a parameter-efficient box adapter for augmenting object semantics in visual contexts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate enhanced capability of LVLMs to generate controlled intent-oriented captions with high spatial detail, achieving state-of-the-art results and recognition as runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet successfully bridges the spatio-temporal gap in LVLMs for video captioning, showcasing its potential in advancing intent-oriented controlled captioning systems.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is
available on https://github.com/thqiu0419/IntentVCNet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDA, an arbitrary-noise-based diffusion model, addressing limitations of EDM's fixed Gaussian noise for image restoration. EDA demonstrates superior results with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional diffusion models (EDM) in image restoration tasks where Gaussian noise corruption increases restoration complexity.

Method: EDA expands EDM by introducing arbitrary noise patterns while maintaining flexibility and efficiency, supported by theoretical validation.

Result: EDA shows state-of-the-art performance in tasks like MRI bias field correction, CT metal artifact reduction, and shadow removal, with only 5 sampling steps.

Conclusion: EDA proves to be a robust and efficient approach for improving image restoration tasks by addressing noise complexity issues while ensuring computational feasibility.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TTS-VAR, a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models to improve generation quality efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up visual generation models is computationally expensive; thus, an efficient method for test-time scaling is needed.

Method: TTS-VAR models generation as a path searching problem and uses adaptive descending batch size schedules, clustering-based diversity search at coarse scales, and resampling-based potential selection at fine scales.

Result: Experiments on the Infinity model show an 8.7% improvement in GenEval score (from 0.69 to 0.75).

Conclusion: TTS-VAR achieves efficient test-time scaling by focusing on hierarchical coarse-to-fine generation, with structural and resampling considerations enhancing final generation quality.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an unposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework for 3D reconstruction, addressing issues with pretrained Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models when dealing with outdoor images. The proposed method globally aligns camera poses and point clouds efficiently and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods rely heavily on pretrained Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. These models face memory and accuracy challenges when processing hundreds of outdoor images, necessitating a more scalable and efficient approach.

Method: The authors propose a framework that partitions input images into subsets, uses a probabilistic Procrustes mapping strategy to align submaps into a global space, and employs joint optimization for 3DGS and camera poses. The approach integrates confidence-aware Gaussians, a soft dustbin mechanism, and 3DGS differentiable rendering with an analytical Jacobian for precise optimization.

Result: The framework demonstrates efficient global alignment of point clouds and poses within minutes for hundreds of images. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI datasets reveal state-of-the-art performance in unposed 3DGS reconstruction.

Conclusion: This novel framework effectively addresses the limitations of MVS-based 3DGS reconstruction, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction and pose estimation from unposed, large-scale image datasets.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor to address the challenge of MRI-iUS registration, achieving superior precision and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unresolved problem of intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound to preoperative magnetic resonance imaging due to modality differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view.

Method: The method involves generating synthetic iUS volumes from preoperative MRI for supervised contrastive training, employing probabilistic keypoint detection and curriculum-based triplet loss to achieve robust and invariant keypoint descriptors for cross-modal matching.

Result: The approach achieves a 69.8% average precision in keypoint matching and a mean target registration error of 2.39 mm for image registration on the ReMIND dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is interpretable, eliminates the need for manual initialization, and is robust to iUS field-of-view variations, offering a significant advancement in MRI-iUS registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack deep-cognitive features like intent recognition, requiring a new dataset for enhanced multi-modal understanding.

Method: VideoMind dataset combines 103K videos paired with audio and multi-layered textual descriptions, including context-driven intent generation using a Chain-of-Thought approach.

Result: The dataset provides standardized annotations for multiple attributes and establishes gold-standard benchmarks with competitive model evaluations.

Conclusion: VideoMind enhances cross-modal video comprehension and benchmarking, advancing applications in intent and emotion recognition and detailed video understanding.

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

TL;DR: This study introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic, annotated images of chicken carcasses, along with a new benchmark dataset, to improve instance segmentation under conditions of limited real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data scarcity and labor-intensive annotation in poultry processing lines for chicken carcass detection.

Method: Developed a pipeline for generating synthetic photo-realistic, labeled images and created a benchmark dataset of 300 real-world annotated images. Evaluated instance segmentation models using mixed datasets of real and synthetic images.

Result: Synthetic data significantly improved segmentation performance across all tested models, proving its efficacy in data augmentation.

Conclusion: Synthetic data serves as an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity, reduce annotation efforts, and enhance AI-driven detection systems in poultry processing.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

*Muhammad Imran Zaman,Nisar Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based approach using a custom CNN to classify age and gender from facial images, achieving improved performance with shared representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack effective shared learning representations for simultaneous age and gender classification.

Method: Custom CNN architecture leveraging correlation between age and gender data, trained on large, pre-processed facial image datasets.

Result: Achieved 95% gender classification accuracy and a mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation.

Conclusion: Shared representations improve classification performance, yet younger age estimations require targeted model refinement and data enhancements.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

### [159] [Facial Demorphing from a Single Morph Using a Latent Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18566)
*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to detect morph attacks and resolve constituent face images from composite morphs, addressing issues in existing methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current demorphing techniques struggle with replication problems, where reconstructed images resemble the morph itself, and lack the capability to handle diverse morphing techniques effectively.

Method: The approach leverages latent space decomposition for demorphing, enabling it to process morphs created using varied methods and face styles. Synthetic faces are utilized for training, while real faces from arbitrary morphing techniques serve as test cases.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques significantly and reconstructs high-quality constituent images.

Conclusion: This approach offers robust and generalizable demorphing capabilities, advancing the identification and analysis of morph attacks in biometric security systems.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

### [160] [Adversarial Distribution Matching for Diffusion Distillation Towards Efficient Image and Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18569)
*Yanzuo Lu,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Shanchuan Lin,Xing Wang,Xuefeng Xiao,Andy J. Ma,Xiaohua Xie,Jian-Huang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a framework that uses adversarial mechanisms for improving score distillation in pre-trained diffusion models, achieving improved performance for one-step and multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of mode collapse induced by the reliance on reverse KL divergence minimization in the existing Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) methods for score distillation.

Method: The paper proposes ADM, which uses diffusion-based discriminators to align latent predictions. It integrates adversarial distillation in latent and pixel spaces, and incorporates a distributional loss on ODE pairs for better pre-training. The final pipeline, DMDX, combines these aspects for unified training.

Result: The proposed method, DMDX, outperforms DMD2 in one-step performance, consuming less GPU time. Multi-step ADM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including efficient image and video synthesis benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adversarial mechanisms, combined with distributional loss and hybrid discriminators, improve both pre-training and fine-tuning stages of score distillation. The approach sets new standards for efficiency and performance in diffusion model compression.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

*Xinyu Wang,Jinghua Hou,Zhe Liu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HybridTM, a hybrid architecture combining Transformer and Mamba for efficient and effective 3D semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to overcome limitations of Transformer-based methods (quadratic complexity) and Mamba-based approaches (feature representation struggles) in 3D semantic segmentation, aiming to integrate their complementary strengths.

Method: The authors propose HybridTM, incorporating a novel Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy that blends attention and Mamba at finer granularities for better modeling of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local features.

Result: Experiments demonstrate HybridTM's effectiveness and generalization across various indoor and outdoor datasets, along with achieving state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybridTM successfully integrates Transformer and Mamba architectures, resolving previous challenges, and proves to be an efficient and superior solution for 3D semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DRWKV, a model designed to improve low-light image enhancement by focusing on edge fidelity and visual naturalness, achieving superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in low-light image enhancement, particularly in preserving edge structures and fine details under extreme lighting degradation.

Method: DRWKV integrates the Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory for separating illumination and edge structures, introduces the Evolving WKV Attention for edge continuity, and uses the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner and MS2-Loss for better luminance-chrominance alignment.

Result: DRWKV outperforms other techniques in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE on five benchmarks, with low computational cost, and enhances performance in low-light multi-object tracking.

Conclusion: DRWKV successfully enhances low-light images both in quality and downstream tasks, demonstrating its reliability and generalization capability.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

### [163] [SIDA: Synthetic Image Driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18632)
*Ye-Chan Kim,SeungJu Cha,Si-Woo Kim,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIDA, a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images instead of text descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance and reduced adaptation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of text-driven methods in zero-shot domain adaptation, which struggle with complex variations and are time-intensive, by leveraging synthetic image data.

Method: SIDA generates synthetic images, applies image translation for target domain style, and uses Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules to enhance style and real-world variation modeling.

Result: SIDA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse and challenging zero-shot adaptation scenarios while achieving high efficiency and reduced adaptation time.

Conclusion: SIDA offers an innovative and practical approach to zero-shot domain adaptation, demonstrating effectiveness in handling complex variations and achieving efficiency.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

*Grace Su,Sheng-Yu Wang,Aaron Hertzmann,Eli Shechtman,Jun-Yan Zhu,Richard Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark aimed at identifying prompted artist names from images generated by text-to-image models and evaluates the challenges across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and moderate the proper usage of text-to-image models, specifically in cases where artist names are invoked in prompts impacting originality and attribution.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of 1.95M images spanning 110 artists and designed scenarios for evaluating performance via baseline models, supervised classifiers, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution, and few-shot learning.

Result: Supervised and few-shot models performed well for seen artists and complex prompts, while multi-artist prompts posed significant challenges; style descriptors showed better generalization when artist styles were prominent.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights gaps in detecting prompted artist attribution, provides substantial room for improvement, and emphasizes ethical concerns tied to text-to-image models' functionality, offering a base for further investigation and responsible development.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

*Junfei Xiao,Ceyuan Yang,Lvmin Zhang,Shengqu Cai,Yang Zhao,Yuwei Guo,Gordon Wetzstein,Maneesh Agrawala,Alan Yuille,Lu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Captain Cinema is an innovative framework for generating short movies using textual storylines, combining keyframe planning and video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for automated generation of visually and narrative-coherent short movies.

Method: It involves top-down keyframe planning for storyline coherence and bottom-up video synthesis for dynamic content, supported by a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) trained on curated cinematic data.

Result: The framework effectively creates high-quality, visually coherent, and narrative-consistent short movies.

Conclusion: Captain Cinema demonstrates the potential of combining keyframe planning and advanced video synthesis for automated cinematic generation.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

*Felix Quinque,Alan Aboudib,Szymon Fonau,Rodrigo Lopez Portillo Alcocer,Brian McCrindle,Steffen Cruz*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces IOTA, a decentralized architecture improving scalability, fairness, and efficiency for training large language models in distributed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of SN9's decentralized pretraining architecture, which lacked scalability and fair incentives.

Method: Implementation of IOTA with novel concepts like SWARM architecture, compressed activations, Butterfly All-Reduce, and CLASP for joint training and fair reward distribution.

Result: Improved scalability through distributed training, efficient bandwidth usage, linear scalability, and fair token reward allocation were demonstrated.

Conclusion: IOTA provides a scalable and efficient solution for collaboratively training large models in decentralized systems, overcoming the core issues of earlier approaches.

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

*Kan Zhu,Haiyang Shi,Le Xu,Jiaxin Shan,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Baris Kasikci,Liguang Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolyServe, a novel scheduling policy to optimize LLM-powered multi-SLO application requests while balancing latency requirements and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in serving LLM-powered applications with diverse latency-specific SLO requirements, enabling optimal user experiences and better scheduling strategies.

Method: PolyServe groups requests into latency bins, assigns them to server subsets, and uses profiling to manage scheduling, tail latency, and dynamic scaling for increased utilization.

Result: PolyServe achieves a 1.23x goodput gain and up to 92.5% of optimal goodput compared to existing scheduling techniques.

Conclusion: PolyServe enables efficient multi-SLO scheduling, balancing high SLO attainment and throughput, making it highly beneficial for diverse latency-sensitive workloads in LLM applications.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study benchmarks five software-based QUBO solvers on varying QUBO matrix scales and convergence thresholds, focusing on solution quality and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance, scalability, and efficiency of different software solvers for large-scale QUBO problems.

Method: Randomly generated QUBO matrices (from 1000x1000 to 45000x45000 in size) were solved using Neal, PyTorch (CPU/GPU), JAX, and SciPy software under six convergence thresholds.

Result: Neal provided the best solution quality but had low scalability. PyTorch delivered a balanced performance, scaling up to 45000 variables with strong GPU/CPU support. JAX and SciPy had trade-offs in scalability and runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: PyTorch is identified as the most balanced and efficient option for solving large-scale QUBO problems, though it sacrifices slightly on solution quality compared to Neal.

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework
for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five
software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and
SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to
45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate
their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time.
Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was
limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption.
PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated
superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support
for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly
shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and
was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU.
SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and
consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation
times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality,
scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most
balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources
permit.

TL;DR: The study explores system integration, compilation models, and memory hierarchies in heterogeneous architectures using RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension, achieving speedups for CNN inference and pre-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in efficient utilization of deep learning accelerators (DLAs) and neural processing units (NPUs) in embedded systems, particularly focusing on proper system integration and execution models.

Method: The research employs the RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension in a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to improve the efficiency of memory-intensive operations like CNN pre/post-processing and fallback layers.

Result: The results demonstrate up to a 9x speedup for image pre-processing and up to 3x speedup for YOLOv3 fallback layer execution compared to traditional CPU systems.

Conclusion: RISC-V Vector 1.0 exposes a flexible programming model, enabling balanced computation and memory usage on accelerator-rich embedded systems while consuming less power than traditional methods.

Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting
deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of
modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant
development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most
expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural
processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of
traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance
tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system
integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these
heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system
integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution
in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware
integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory
hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally
verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at
runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator
speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V
Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within
a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and
CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image
pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.
We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable
a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs
supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than
traditional parallel execution platforms.

Conclusion: Caching strategies improve FL scalability and efficiency, enabling practical deployment in applications like smart cities and healthcare.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves
scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in generating DL kernels are limited by hardware support, kernel categorization, and task coverage.

Method: The authors developed MultiKernelBench, covering 285 tasks across 14 kernel categories and supporting Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. They designed a modular backend abstraction layer for extensibility and proposed a category-aware one-shot prompting method.

Result: Evaluations revealed significant task difficulty variation, limited LLM generalization to underexposed platforms, and that targeted prompting strategies improve kernel generation outcomes.

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench serves as a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM-based DL kernel generation across platforms, enabling extensibility and improved evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high-performance edge AI systems that are adaptable and reconfigurable for field operators needing real-time flexibility.

Method: CHAMP utilizes a modular architecture with FPGA-based accelerators, a high-throughput USB3 bus, and a custom operating system (VDiSK) to enable hot-swappable AI modules, secured data, and runtime reconfiguration.

Conclusion: CHAMP is a promising modular AI platform suitable for field applications like biometrics and disaster response, with future improvements planned in hardware and software to enhance scalability and performance.

Abstract: What if you could piece together your own custom biometrics and AI analysis
system, a bit like LEGO blocks? We aim to bring that technology to field
operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system
that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP
(Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular
edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in
specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object
tracking, and document analysis. CHAMP leverages low-power FPGA-based
accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating
system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically
secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design,
including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK
operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic
capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments
demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute
accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of
the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field
biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future
improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.

Method: The study introduces a closed-loop architecture integrating NWDAF and UPF, embedding an artificial intelligence model for latency estimation and game classification.

Result: The proposed architecture enhances latency awareness in the 5G control plane and facilitates game classification with AI embedded in NWDAF.

Conclusion: The integration of NWDAF and UPF with AI achieves better user latency estimation, informs the 5G control plane, and stimulates advancements in mobile edge gaming research.

Abstract: The latest generation of games and pervasive communication technologies poses
challenges in service management and Service-Level Agreement compliance for
mobile users. State-of-the-art edge-gaming techniques enhance throughput,
reduce latency, and leverage cloud computing. However, further development of
core functions such as the User Plane Function (UPF) is needed for

### [174] [PowerTrip: Exploiting Federated Heterogeneous Datacenter Power for Distributed ML Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17904)
*Talha Mehboob,Luanzheng Guo,Nathan Tallent,Michael Zink,David Irwin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PowerTrip, a system for optimizing training of large AI models across power-constrained, geo-distributed data centers by dynamically trading off power availability and network latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to distribute training workloads of large-scale AI models across multiple sites arises from the insufficient power capacity of single data centers, but this introduces challenges such as network latency and heterogeneous power availability.

Method: PowerTrip adopts a dynamic greedy approach and employs a power-to-cost heuristic to select data center sites that maximize training efficiency by balancing power availability and network latency.

Result: PowerTrip achieved up to a 50% reduction in time-to-accuracy compared to existing baseline approaches in evaluations using real-world power capacity constraints.

Conclusion: The study shows that dynamic site selection considering power constraints and network latencies effectively improves training efficiency for large AI models in geo-distributed environments.

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and
power demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due
to the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional
computational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across
geographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach
introduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,
creating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing
greater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network
latency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or
using heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous
power supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability
between sites.
  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,
geo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically
selects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication
trade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost
heuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network
latency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain
in training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to
optimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network
overhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our
evaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power
capacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy
by up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.

*Shengye Song,Minxian Xu,Zuowei Zhang,Chengxi Gao,Fansong Zeng,Yu Ding,Kejiang Ye,Chengzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces strategies to mitigate resource competition and interference in microservices co-located on large-scale cloud platforms, achieving high accuracy in prediction and improved application latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address resource competition and interference among microservices co-located on cloud infrastructure, which challenges performance optimization in large-scale, heterogeneous environments.

Method: Analysis of cluster characteristics, usage of cycle per instruction (CPI) as an interference metric, development of accurate CPI prediction models, and introduction of C-Koordinator platform for interference mitigation.

Result: The CPI prediction models achieve over 90.3% accuracy, while the C-Koordinator platform demonstrates 16.7%-36.1% latency improvements under varying load conditions compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: The system effectively maintains smooth application performance and reduces response time variabilities in co-located microservice environments, validating the proposed strategies and models.

Abstract: Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight,
loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many
enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource
utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different
microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and
interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for
large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource
utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges
are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node
heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and
co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per
instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in
large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction
of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction
and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an
open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates
co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction
models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction
and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,
application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,
P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%
under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results
demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in
co-located environments.

TL;DR: CoCoServe introduces an elastic system for efficient large language model (LLM) serving that dynamically scales at module levels, significantly reducing costs and improving performance compared to existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of current LLM serving systems, which struggle with balancing resource demands and dynamic workloads due to static deployments and high scaling costs.

Method: The method involves developing CoCoServe, which uses module-level operations (replication and migration of LLM modules) to optimize resource allocation and performance. It employs an auto-scaling mechanism based on comprehensive trade-off analysis.

Result: CoCoServe reduces serving costs by 46%, cuts latency by 14%-75%, and achieves throughput improvements of 1.16x-4x compared to state-of-the-art systems, across diverse workloads and LLM sizes.

Conclusion: CoCoServe provides a more efficient, cost-effective, and performance-optimized approach to LLM serving, addressing dynamic workload needs and surpassing existing systems in scalability and resource utilization.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities across
various fields but has also introduced significant challenges in resource
management. Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing
serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic
patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and
performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of
adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of
efficient LLM serving.
  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates
dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level
operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder
layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs
associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that
dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance
optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit
excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining
availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging
Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and
achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and
workloads.

Result: Real-world evaluations demonstrate improved resource allocation, reduced latency, increased throughput, and dynamic adaptation to workload fluctuations using Kubernetes autoscaling.

Conclusion: Cloud Native architectures have the potential to reshape scalable LLM inference serving, offering optimized performance and insights valuable to both researchers and industry stakeholders.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing numerous industries, but
their substantial computational demands create challenges for efficient
deployment, particularly in cloud environments. Traditional approaches to
inference serving often struggle with resource inefficiencies, leading to high
operational costs, latency issues, and limited scalability. This article
explores how Cloud Native technologies, such as containerization,
microservices, and dynamic scheduling, can fundamentally improve LLM inference
serving. By leveraging these technologies, we demonstrate how a Cloud Native
system enables more efficient resource allocation, reduces latency, and
enhances throughput in high-demand scenarios. Through real-world evaluations
using Kubernetes-based autoscaling, we show that Cloud Native architectures can
dynamically adapt to workload fluctuations, mitigating performance bottlenecks
while optimizing LLM inference serving performance. This discussion provides a
broader perspective on how Cloud Native frameworks could reshape the future of
scalable LLM inference serving, offering key insights for researchers,
practitioners, and industry leaders in cloud computing and artificial
intelligence.

*Lucas Liebe,Thanh-Tung Nguyen,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCPO, a framework combining Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) and Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) to tackle issues in real-time Edge Video Analytics (EVA), achieving substantial improvements in throughput, latency, and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge Video Analytics (EVA) applications require real-time inference capabilities. Current scheduling systems struggle to adapt quickly in dynamic environments, leading to inefficiencies. There is a need for scalable, adaptable systems that integrate local and global learning approaches.

Method: FCPO integrates CRL to adapt to dynamic environments and FRL to enhance generalization across models. It uses techniques like dynamic adjustment of batch size, resolution, multi-threading, an agent-specific aggregation scheme, and a diversity-aware experience buffer.

Result: Experiments demonstrated FCPO's superiority, achieving over 5x improvement in throughput, 60% reduction in latency, 20% faster convergence, and up to 10x less memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art RL approaches.

Conclusion: FCPO effectively addresses scalability, adaptability, and knowledge integration issues in EVA systems, providing a robust solution with significant performance enhancements over current RL approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of
intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving
systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload
distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended
scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge
environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments
between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability
issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated
RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts
inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and
post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision
Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves
generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across
inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme
and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA
testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced
latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption
compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper solves efficiency and scalability issues in Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) by introducing a framework with four optimizations, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address efficiency and scalability challenges in PDES engines, specifically inefficient synchronization and resource allocation, as well as complex entity interaction patterns.

Method: The authors introduce four improvements: asynchronous listener threads, METIS-based load balancing, constraint satisfaction-based entity interaction solver, and spatial hashing for optimized nearest-neighbor searches.

Result: Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo shows 16x acceleration over baseline implementations, 8x speedup over single-thread setups, and a 58.18% reduction in synchronization overhead.

Conclusion: These enhancements significantly improve PDES for large-scale simulation scenarios, establishing an effective solution for handling scalability and efficiency issues.

Abstract: Rising demand for complex simulations highlights conventional
engines'scalability limits, spurring Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
adoption.Warped2, a PDES engine leveraging Time Warp synchronization with
Pending Event Set optimization, delivers strong performance, it struggles with
inherent wargaming limitations: inefficient LP resource allocation during
synchronization and unaddressed complex entity interaction patterns. To address
these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic
improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event
monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling
mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to
address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)
Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed
to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome
O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.
Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant
enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark
results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline
implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI
and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration
strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing
accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization
factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation
in large-scale simulation scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based data replication strategy for cloud systems to optimize service quality, provider profits, and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current threshold-based methods for data replication in cloud systems require manual adjustments by administrators, creating challenges under varying workloads and architectures.

Method: Authors use reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt replication strategies, defining states, actions, and rewards within their proposed system architecture.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates the capability to automatically learn system behaviors and effectively adjust to workload variations.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning offers a scalable, adaptive solution for cloud data replication, balancing robust service delivery with economic and ecological considerations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable
distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data
replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved
performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on
threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload
changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the
responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,
reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and
different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication
strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically
learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim
is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off
between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture
behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining
the states, actions and rewards.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC is a Quantization-Aware Training framework designed for efficient edge-device model retraining using coreset selection and layer correction strategies, improving performance even with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and significant performance degradation of traditional Quantization-Aware Training methods when using limited edge data due to privacy constraints.

Method: QuaRC employs a two-phase approach: the 'Relative Entropy Score' for effective coreset selection and the 'Cascaded Layer Correction' strategy to reduce intermediate layer quantization errors during training.

Result: QuaRC demonstrated a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K for ResNet-18 quantized to 2-bit using only 1% of the dataset, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: QuaRC enhances low-bit quantized model performance on edge devices, allowing efficient retraining with minimal data while addressing quantization error challenges.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study develops a generalized AI-based model using causality-invariant learning to improve data reconstruction in semantic communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance channel decoder performance by leveraging common knowledge for robust and reliable data reconstruction, even in diverse and evolving user data environments.

Method: The paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) employing causality-invariant learning to extract semantic causal representations, with sparse update protocols to adapt to evolving user data.

Result: Empirical evaluations revealed consistent performance across devices, robustness in classification tasks, and superior data reconstruction quality measured by PSNR compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The integration of causality-invariant learning and sparse update mechanisms produced a robust and generalizable semantic communication system, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in several key aspects.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

*Jingyi Ding,Chengwen Qi,Hongfei Wang,Jianshe Wu,Licheng Jiao,Yuwei Guo,Jian Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how self-similarity in deep neural network feature networks influences performance and proposes a method to enhance it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited understanding of how self-similarity in hidden space geometry impacts weight optimization and neuron dynamics in deep learning models.

Method: The study uses a complex network model of hidden-layer neuron outputs to examine self-similarity in feature networks and its impact on classification performance.

Result: Embedding self-similarity constraints during training boosts performance in MLP and attention architectures by up to 6%.

Conclusion: Self-similarity plays a significant role in neural network optimization, and targeted adjustments can provide notable performance gains.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based optimization algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization, aiming to reduce computational complexity and understand optimization results better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize computational effort in aerodynamic optimization while deriving interpretable results related to the role of discovered extrema in flow-field behavior.

Method: A surrogate-based, actor-critic RL approach with MCMC is used, leveraging temporal freezing of parameters. The algorithm involves optimizing parameters locally using intermediate CFD simulations as ground truth.

Result: The method effectively speeds up global optimization under two conditions: large enough local parameter neighborhoods and accurate reward/cost estimates. It also interprets results by assigning feature importance scores.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based method demonstrates computational efficiency and interpretability, offering insights into the aerodynamic features critical for achieving desired flow-fields.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

TL;DR: This paper reviews hyperbolic neural networks as an alternative to Euclidean geometry in foundation models, aiming to address representational and adaptability limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental limitations in foundation models such as limited representation, lower adaptability, and scalability, and to explore whether alternative geometric spaces (e.g., hyperbolic) can better model real-world data structures.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive literature review on hyperbolic neural networks and their applications in improving the reasoning, generalization, and alignment capabilities of LLMs and VLMs, leveraging hyperbolic geometry's properties like low-dimensional embeddings for hierarchical data.

Result: Using hyperbolic geometry has shown improvements in LLMs' reasoning abilities, VLMs' zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment while being parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic spaces offer valuable benefits for overcoming the structural and adaptability issues of current foundation models, but significant challenges remain, requiring further research and development.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

### [186] [Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788)
*Ali Vardasbi,Gustavo Penha,Claudia Hauff,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses position bias and low repetition consistency in LLMs during ranking tasks, introducing a dynamic early-stopping strategy for reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit susceptibility to position bias and repetition inconsistency, which can affect their ranking decisions. Existing solutions, like multiple prompts with aggregation, are computationally intensive, prompting the need for a more efficient mitigation strategy.

Method: The researchers introduce a per-instance, dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively minimizes repetitions for each instance. They also propose a confidence-based enhancement to this approach.

Result: The dynamic early-stopping method reduced LLM calls by 81% on average while maintaining accuracy. The confidence-based adaptation achieved an 87% average reduction in calls with a small accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Dynamic repetition strategies offer significant efficiency gains in addressing position bias and consistency issues in LLMs, demonstrating practical utility in varied tasks while ensuring accuracy.

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

*Jingyi Yu,Tim Pychynski,Marco F. Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CICME is a new method to estimate causal mechanisms across domains using heterogeneous data, improving causal discovery accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance understanding of complex sensor systems by studying causality through heterogeneous data and discovering domain-invariant mechanisms.

Method: The CICME approach involves three steps to identify causal mechanisms: leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning, pooled data analysis, and individual domain analysis.

Result: CICME demonstrates superior performance on linear Gaussian models inspired by manufacturing, outperforming baseline methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: CICME effectively combines pooled and individual analysis to identify causal mechanisms, proving reliable under specific conditions in heterogeneous scenarios.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCAI, a new framework using generative AI and copula-based modeling for improving multivariate time-series forecasting and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance predictive accuracy and robust anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based model for capturing dependencies, conformal prediction calibration, dimensionality reduction, and copula-based modeling for anomaly scores.

Result: Validated effectiveness on real-world water distribution and sewerage system data, achieving accurate predictions and reliable anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CoCAI provides a theoretically sound, efficient, and actionable framework for multivariate time-series analysis with minimal deployment overhead.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSDM, a hybrid model combining diffusion models and transformers, enhanced by LLMs, to improve service-level mobile traffic prediction accuracy and adaptability across diverse urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of inaccurate and inconsistent mobile traffic prediction due to uncertainties in user traffic patterns, lack of environmental context, and complex service dependencies.

Method: The proposed approach, LSDM, combines diffusion models with transformer-based adaptive learning, incorporating multimodal environmental context using Large Language Models for better traffic pattern modeling.

Result: Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show LSDM outperforms similar models, reducing root mean squared error by at least 8.29% and improving prediction performance with contextual information by 2.83%.

Conclusion: LSDM proves effective in overcoming key issues in mobile traffic prediction, offering improved accuracy and adaptability. The code and dataset are shared for further research.

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenSelect, a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks, aiming to improve efficiency and effectiveness by utilizing their comparative strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for test-time scaling in reasoning tasks either underutilize the comparative strengths of LLMs (pointwise methods) or scale inefficiently with larger sampling budgets (pairwise methods).

Method: The authors propose GenSelect, wherein LLMs engage in extensive reasoning to select the best solution from N candidates, optimizing efficiency while leveraging comparative capabilities.

Result: Using GenSelect with math reasoning models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, this approach outperformed established scoring methods employing simple prompts.

Conclusion: GenSelect effectively utilizes LLMs' comparative abilities for reasoning tasks, offering an efficient solution for parallel sampling budgets and outperforming current methodologies.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

*Lakshmana Sri Harsha Nemani,P. K. Srijith,Tomasz Kuśmierczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method to quantify uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) by distilling uncertainty-aware teacher models into smaller student models without performance loss, requiring only one forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification in LLMs is computationally expensive with existing Bayesian and ensemble-based methods that require multiple forward passes.

Method: The authors use distillation of uncertainty-aware teacher models into compact student models with LoRA fine-tuning. They compare softmax-based output students to those using evidential learning with Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the student models perform comparably or better than the teacher models in both predictive and uncertainty quantification tasks and require only a single forward pass.

Conclusion: The study introduces a new paradigm of evidential distillation, enabling robust and efficient uncertainty estimation in LLMs.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

*Kenta Shiraishi,Yuka Muto,Atsushi Okazaki,Shunji Kotsuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a method using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to enhance high-resolution precipitation predictions, emphasizing perceptual realism over conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving accurate HR precipitation predictions, particularly for stationary and localized heavy rainfall, using conventional numerical weather prediction models.

Method: The authors propose employing WGAN with optimal transport cost for precipitation downscaling, comparing it with traditional neural networks trained on mean squared error.

Result: WGAN produced realistic precipitation visuals with fine-scale structures, aligning well with human perceptual realism despite slightly lower performance on traditional evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: WGAN not only enhances perceptual realism in precipitation predictions but also introduces a novel approach for evaluating and quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Motivation: The paper aims to understand the relationship between Fisher information matrices and NTK, and to explore their spectral properties and implications for neural networks.

Method: It analyzes 2-layer ReLU networks with random hidden weights, examines the linear connection between Fisher information matrices and NTK, and provides spectral decompositions and eigenfunction characterizations.

Result: Spectral decomposition of NTK is presented with explicit forms of eigenfunctions and major eigenvalues. An approximation formula for functions generated by 2-layer neural networks is derived.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of NTK and Fisher matrices, providing a deeper insight into network behavior and approximation capabilities.

Abstract: Fisher information matrices and neural tangent kernels (NTK) for 2-layer ReLU
networks with random hidden weight are argued. We discuss the relation between

*Lijun Wu,Dong Hao,Zhiyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphEXT introduces a novel explainability framework for GNNs using cooperative game theory, focusing on structural interactions over node attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of effective explainability methods for GNNs, given their 'black-box' nature and the intricate interactions among nodes.

Method: GraphEXT utilizes cooperative game theory concepts like social externalities and Shapley value to partition nodes into coalitions, assessing node importance via impacts on GNN predictions during structural changes.

Result: GraphEXT demonstrates superior fidelity in explaining GNN predictions on synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that GraphEXT significantly improves the explainability of GNNs by focusing on graph structure dynamics and interactions, offering a robust alternative to attribute-centric methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

*Varsha Ramineni,Hossein A. Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the use of synthetic data to assess fairness in AI classifiers when complete datasets with demographic details are inaccessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI's prevalent use in critical domains raises concerns about biases and fairness, which are heightened by global AI regulations mandating fairness reviews and bias audits. However, limited access to demographic data poses challenges in fairness testing.

Method: The paper suggests constructing synthetic datasets by leveraging separate overlapping datasets to include demographic information. These synthetic datasets are validated by comparing them to real-world data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that synthetic data-based fairness metrics align with those derived from real data, validating the approach.

Conclusion: Synthetic data serves as a viable and consistent substitute for fairness evaluation in AI systems, particularly when real demographic data is unavailable.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "molecular task arithmetic" to generate molecules with desirable properties without using positively labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of positively labeled molecules for generative design is a significant limitation.

Method: The method involves training models on abundant negative examples to learn property directions and reversing these directions to produce desirable molecules.

Result: Molecular task arithmetic outperformed models trained on positive molecules in generating diverse and successful zero-shot designs. It also improved performance in dual-objective and few-shot tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is simple, data-efficient, and effective, with the potential to become a standard transfer learning strategy for molecule design.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the capability of neural networks in handling non-periodic inputs and efficiently learning the dynamics of stochastic systems.

Method: MFNO extends Fourier Neural Operator with mirror padding and uses theoretical foundations like Wong-Zakai theorems and approximation techniques.

Result: MFNO shows exceptional generalization in resolution, competitive or superior performance compared to architectures like LSTMs and TCNs, and faster sample path generation.

Conclusion: MFNO is a robust approach for approximating path-dependent stochastic differential equations with high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming standard methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

*Amrith Setlur,Pratiksha Thaker,Jonathan Ullman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness of public-private data combinations in differentially private algorithms, showing limits depending on distribution shifts between the data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether combining public and private data improves learning outcomes, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: The study extends lower bound analysis to cases with significant distribution shifts in Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Result: Findings show that small distribution shifts require abundant data from either source, while large shifts render public data unhelpful.

Conclusion: The utility of combining public and private data is limited by the extent of distribution shifts between them.

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents ARBoids, an adaptive reinforcement learning approach combining deep reinforcement learning and a Boids model to improve unmanned surface vehicles' defensive strategies against more agile attackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of defending a target region against adversarial unmanned surface vehicles with superior maneuverability.

Method: The ARBoids framework integrates a biologically inspired, force-based Boids model as a baseline policy with deep reinforcement learning, which refines and optimizes defenders' actions through a residual learning approach.

Result: Simulation results show that ARBoids outperforms traditional interception strategies like pure force-based methods and standard deep reinforcement learning policies.

Conclusion: ARBoids proves to be an effective, robust, and generalizable solution for target defense scenarios, capable of adapting to diverse adversarial maneuverability profiles.

Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target
region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario
arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the
defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this
challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual
reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this
framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline
policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to
adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is
validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating
superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure
force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned
policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability
profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code
of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.

*Obaidullah Zaland,Chanh Nguyen,Florian T. Pokorny,Monowar Bhuyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) with cloud robotic manipulation to address computational challenges while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational limitations of robots and leverage FL's privacy-preserving model to improve cloud robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: The paper discusses the theoretical frameworks connecting FL to cloud robotic manipulation and explores centralized and decentralized FL model designs.

Result: The paper identifies the potential of FL to offer privacy, scalability, and efficient computation while also outlining associated challenges in its application to cloud robotics.

Conclusion: FL provides a promising avenue to enhance cloud robotic manipulation by addressing computational and privacy concerns, but challenges remain for implementation at a large scale.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Result: The framework captures microstructural features in a latent space, enabling structure-property exploration and inverse design. It reduces computational costs and allows for tailored metamaterial generation.

Conclusion: The pVAE approach effectively designs porous metamaterials with desired hydraulic performance, offering computational efficiency and supporting further open-access research.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

*Charles H Martin,Christopher Hinrichs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) to explain the heavy-tailed power-law phenomena observed in neural networks and predicts trends in their test accuracies using mathematical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and formally explain the mechanisms behind the remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) neural networks, specifically focusing on heavy-tailed power-law phenomena observed in their learning dynamics.

Method: The authors employ statistical mechanics, advanced random matrix theory, and quantum chemistry to derive the SETOL framework. They validate their theory using empirical spectral density (ESD) metrics and compare it to prior phenomenological models (HTSR).

Result: SETOL metrics (ERG, alpha) are shown to align well with predictions, both in simple multilayer perceptrons and complex SOTA models. It offers a robust mathematical explanation for layer-wise quality analysis without requiring test or training datasets.

Conclusion: SETOL provides a unifying theoretical framework for understanding neural network performance. It introduces measurable preconditions for ideal learning, bridging theory and practical performance analysis in modern neural networks.

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

*Jessica Quaye,Charvi Rastogi,Alicia Parrish,Oana Inel,Minsuk Kahng,Lora Aroyo,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid method, Seed2Harvest, to generate diverse adversarial prompts for evaluating text-to-image (T2I) models, combining human creativity with machine efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to generate adversarial prompts for T2I models are either limited in diversity and size (human-crafted) or lack realistic nuances (synthetic). There is a need for a scalable yet nuanced approach.

Method: Seed2Harvest uses human-crafted adversarial prompt seeds and expands them with a guided machine-based approach, ensuring cultural diversity and preserving attack patterns.

Result: The method achieves higher diversity, with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, while maintaining comparable attack success rates across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Human-machine collaboration can effectively enhance the scalability and diversity of adversarial prompt datasets, ensuring robust evaluation of T2I models against attacks.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

*Hongrong Yang,Markus Schlaepfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanPulse is a deep learning framework aimed at improving city-wide OD flow prediction with enhanced scalability and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing population flow prediction methods, such as static assumptions, poor generalization, and computational inefficiencies, while expanding the resolution across entire cities.

Method: UrbanPulse uses a temporal graph convolutional encoder and a transformer-based decoder alongside a three-stage transfer learning strategy for robust, scalable spatiotemporal modeling.

Result: Tested on 103 million GPS records across three California cities, UrbanPulse demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability in population flow prediction.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse showcases the potential of high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting that can be effectively deployed across diverse metropolitan landscapes.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

### [206] [Multimodal Fine-grained Reasoning for Post Quality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17934)
*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed MFTRR framework addresses issues in assessing post quality by adopting a multimodal ranking task, outperforming state-of-the-art models by notable margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately assessing post quality is challenging due to the need for nuanced relational reasoning, but existing methods rely on unimodal approaches and fail to capture comprehensive semantic relationships.

Method: The MFTRR framework uses multimodal fine-grained reasoning with two key modules: a Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning Module for semantic interactions and a Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning Module for evidence-based reasoning.

Result: MFTRR significantly improves post-quality assessments, with an up to 9.52% improvement in NDCG@3 over unimodal methods on evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: MFTRR effectively mimics human reasoning processes, enhancing multimodal post quality assessments through refined semantic and relational modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

TL;DR: VIBE is a two-stage Transformer model combining video, audio, and text data to accurately predict fMRI activity and has shown strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a unified model that integrates multi-modal data (video, audio, and text) to improve the prediction of fMRI activity, addressing the challenge of accurately modeling brain activity from diverse input modalities.

Method: VIBE uses a two-stage Transformer architecture: a modality-fusion transformer merges representations from pre-trained models for video, audio, and text, and a prediction transformer temporally decodes the combined representations with rotary embeddings. It is trained on 65 hours of movie fMRI data and uses ensemble techniques for robust predictions.

Result: VIBE achieves strong performance with Pearson correlations of 32.25 for in-distribution data (Friends S07) and 21.25 for out-of-distribution films. It has also achieved notable rankings in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Conclusion: VIBE demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multi-modal inputs with advanced Transformer architectures for fMRI activity prediction, setting a new standard in brain decoding tasks.

Abstract: We present VIBE, a two-stage Transformer that fuses multi-modal video, audio,
and text features to predict fMRI activity. Representations from open-source
models (Qwen2.5, BEATs, Whisper, SlowFast, V-JEPA) are merged by a
modality-fusion transformer and temporally decoded by a prediction transformer
with rotary embeddings. Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod
dataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson
correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six
out-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture
obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second
overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the GeoAggregator model for geospatial data analysis, enhancing accuracy, speed, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better model and explain geospatial tabular data, addressing inefficiencies and limitations in the original GeoAggregator model.

Method: The paper proposes an optimized dataloading pipeline, integrates model ensembling, and employs GeoShapley explanations for enhanced functionality and efficiency.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets show improved prediction accuracy and faster inference speeds for the updated GeoAggregator model, along with effective spatial explanation capabilities.

Conclusion: The enhanced GeoAggregator model surpasses its previous version in performance and explainability, becoming a robust tool for analyzing geospatial data. A public resource is provided for accessibility.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIFOTL is a privacy-conscious and noise-resilient method for analyzing data shifts in tabular datasets, addressing healthcare challenges and achieving high F1 scores across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing data shifts in tabular datasets for decision-making is challenging due to privacy restrictions and observational noise, especially in healthcare settings.

Method: The SIFOTL approach extracts privacy-compliant summary statistics, uses twin XGBoost models and LLMs for signal disentanglement, and merges results through Pareto-weighted decision trees to identify factors causing shifts.

Result: SIFOTL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving high F1 scores (0.85 on the MEPS dataset and 0.86-0.96 across diverse synthetic EHR datasets) while maintaining robustness against noise.

Conclusion: SIFOTL is a privacy-conscious, interpretable, and empirically effective method suitable for analyzing data shifts in noisy and privacy-restricted tabular datasets.

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel machine unlearning paradigm for improving privacy, cybersecurity, and trust in traffic state estimation and prediction models by enabling selective forgetting of sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the privacy, cybersecurity, and public trust issues in intelligent transportation systems caused by the misuse and retention of sensitive data.

Method: Introduces a machine unlearning approach that allows trained traffic estimation models to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data.

Result: This paradigm enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of traffic state estimation by ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, such as the 'right to be forgotten.'

Conclusion: The proposed unlearning framework strengthens data-driven intelligent transportation systems' reliability and addresses privacy concerns effectively.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a predictive framework for optimizing the computational expense of reinforcement learning-based LLM fine-tuning, offering empirical scaling laws and training phase insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with reinforcement learning methods is costly, prompting a need for efficient optimization strategies to reduce computational requirements.

Method: A predictive framework is developed to model training dynamics, with empirical scaling laws extracted from experiments on Llama and Qwen models to predict reward trajectories and training phases.

Result: The study identifies three training phases and demonstrates that stopping training after a certain epoch can save compute resources while retaining performance.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes across model types and offers a guideline for optimizing GRPO-based LLM fine-tuning efficiently.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper develops a deep learning framework based on neural operators to provide arbitrary resolution solutions for physical systems governed by PDEs, specifically for applications like ocean current data downscaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and high-resolution modeling of physical systems is critical in fields such as oceanography for coastal management and environmental monitoring. However, existing satellite and global ocean models often lack sufficient spatial resolution for local analyses.

Method: A supervised deep learning framework using neural operators is introduced, which can solve PDEs and work with inputs of varying resolutions. The framework is employed for downscaling Copernicus ocean current data and modeling surrogate PDEs.

Result: The proposed model was validated on real-world Copernicus ocean current data and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict solutions at arbitrary resolutions.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable deep learning-based solution that enhances spatial granularity and facilitates high-resolution analysis critical for oceanography and similar fields.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Motivation: To address issues in reinforcement learning algorithms for large language models, such as instability, inefficiency, and complication in RL infrastructure.

Method: GSPO introduces sequence-level importance ratios for clipping, rewarding, and optimization, departing from token-level approaches.

Result: The method outperforms GRPO in training efficiency and performance, stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) training, and simplifies RL infrastructure.

Conclusion: GSPO proves to be a robust and effective algorithm, contributing to significant advancements in Qwen3 language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,
efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the

*Ryusei Fujimoto,Yugo Nakamura,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-AAE, a new framework combining an autoencoder and ADPCM, reduces user re-identification while maintaining healthcare activity recognition accuracy and reducing data storage needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare applications increasingly rely on wearable sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes, which pose privacy risks due to their ability to re-identify users via behavioral signatures.

Method: The proposed C-AAE method combines an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) to suppress identity cues and Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM) to encode and shrink the latent data further.

Result: C-AAE reduces user re-identification scores by 10-15 percentage points compared to AAE alone, retains activity recognition within 5 percentage points of the unprotected baseline, and shrinks data size by ~75%.

Conclusion: C-AAE is a practical solution for privacy-preserving, sensor-based activity recognition that balances data compression, privacy, and utility effectively.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM is an ultra low-bit quantization framework for large language models, reducing storage and computational costs while mitigating performance degradation from extreme compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of deploying large language models that require significant computational resources and storage by exploring ultra low-bit quantization without drastic accuracy loss.

Method: It introduces a staged mixed-precision post-training quantization framework, employing innovations such as PBAR to refine weight significance and FIAS to preserve full activation information, combining 1-bit and 4-bit weights.

Result: Squeeze10-LLM achieves an average of 1.6 bits per weight, boosting the average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six zero-shot classification tasks in LLaMA and LLaMA2 models.

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM sets new benchmarks for sub-2bit quantization in LLMs, significantly improving performance while enabling efficient deployment. Code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how leveraging additional supervision, such as confidence scores, improves classification models under limited training data, proposing a theoretical framework to refine labels through their mixture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training machine learning models on limited data is challenging. There's a need to explore how enriching labels with additional supervision can enhance model accuracy in these data-scarce scenarios.

Method: The authors propose treating both hard labels and additional supervision as probability distributions and create refined soft labels through their affine combination. They analyze how additional supervision refines direction and mixing coefficients adjust step size in label refinement.

Result: Their theoretical findings show that additional supervision benefits the model’s generalization by revealing the distribution information of non-hard-labelled classes. Empirical findings confirm that applying the insights improves classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that designing additional supervision, guided by their framework, is beneficial for building better models in limited-data settings, demonstrating complementary roles of direction and step size in label refinement.

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses radio access network (RAN) slicing in an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture using a delay-aware reinforcement learning approach, achieving a 38% reduction in average delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize physical resource block (PRB) allocation for multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) while meeting probabilistic delay bounds with minimal resource usage in an open RAN architecture.

Method: The authors derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers, modify it for real-world implementation, and propose a Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL) solution. They also introduce a reward-based model weight personalization technique for MVNOs.

Result: PDA-DRL achieves a 38% reduction in average delay compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the reward-based personalization method outperforms traditional aggregation methods like federated averaging.

Conclusion: The proposed PDA-DRL method effectively minimizes delays and optimizes PRB utilization in a competitive multi-operator O-RAN environment, while the personalization approach enhances robustness and performance for MVNOs.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

*Junyong Jiang,Buwei Tian,Chenxing Xu,Songze Li,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel adversarial attack method targeting Reinforcement Learning systems, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for optimized reward modification without altering the environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing adversarial attacks on RL systems that require policy or environment alterations, the paper seeks a more practical method that directly exploits RL agent vulnerabilities.

Method: Develop a reward iteration optimization framework using LLMs for generating tailored adversarial rewards and introduce an algorithm for identifying critical states where RL agents are most prone to fail.

Result: Experimental results in varied environments showcase that the proposed method surpasses existing approaches in degrading the performance of RL systems.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial attack framework effectively misleads RL systems into suboptimal decision-making, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in RL models and the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

### [219] [Maximizing Prefix-Confidence at Test-Time Efficiently Improves Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18122)
*Matthias Otth,Jonas Hübotter,Ido Hakimi,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that language models can significantly improve in mathematical reasoning tasks by using their own confidence (prefix-confidence) to guide their predictions during test-time, outperforming traditional approaches like majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore self-improvement capabilities of language models without external influences, specifically in the context of mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper introduces 'prefix-confidence scaling,' where the language model selects the most promising continuation based on its confidence in prefixes (up to 32 tokens). They evaluate this method across five datasets at different difficulty levels.

Result: Their method achieves better performance compared to majority voting, avoids length-biased errors, and offers an improved accuracy-compute efficiency. However, test-time training with prefix-confidence does not surpass prefix-confidence scaling performance.

Conclusion: Prefix-confidence scaling is effective for test-time improvement in mathematical reasoning tasks, showing potential for enhancing language model reasoning without extensive compute or traditional validation steps.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

### [221] [When Noisy Labels Meet Class Imbalance on Graphs: A Graph Augmentation Method with LLM and Pseudo Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18153)
*Riting Xia,Rucong Wang,Yulin Liu,Anchen Li,Xueyan Liu,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphALP addresses class-imbalanced graph node classification with noisy labels using LLM-based augmentation and pseudo-labeling to improve label accuracy and reduce noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-imbalanced node classification on graphs often assumes clean labels, but real-world data regularly contains label noise, necessitating a robust approach.

Method: GraphALP leverages LLM-based synthetic node generation for minority classes and dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling to manage noisy labels effectively.

Result: Experimental comparisons demonstrated GraphALP's superior performance over existing techniques for node classification in class-imbalanced and noisy label scenarios.

Conclusion: GraphALP offers an effective solution to tackle both class imbalance and label noise in graph node classification, leveraging advancements in LLM and pseudo-labeling techniques.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

*Jianchao Wang,Qingfeng Li,Pengcheng Zheng,Xiaorong Pu,Yazhou Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChronoSelect is a novel framework designed to handle noisy labels in deep neural networks by leveraging temporal dynamics and a four-stage memory mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of noisy labels in real-world datasets that degrade the generalization performance of over-parameterized models.

Method: Introduces ChronoSelect, a four-stage memory architecture with sliding update and controlled decay to analyze temporal learning patterns and partition data into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets.

Result: ChronoSelect outperforms existing techniques in benchmarks, providing state-of-the-art results, backed by theoretical guarantees of stability under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: Temporal dynamics and memory-based methods effectively improve performance in learning with noisy labels, as validated by ChronoSelect's success.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new Graph Neural Network (GNN) that improves goal classification for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, demonstrating superior generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately predicting future states of traffic participants, a critical aspect for autonomous driving systems to operate effectively in unseen or new environments.

Method: The researchers propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that uses a heterogeneous graph combining traffic participant data with a vectorized road network. A multi-staged approach is utilized to classify trajectory endpoints.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates better generalization capability during cross-dataset evaluation, specifically when training on Argoverse2 and testing on NuScenes.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of their GNN model in improving goal selection and generalization for autonomous driving systems, offering a solution to current generalization limitations of trajectory prediction models.

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated learning framework for graph data, addressing inefficiencies of synchronous methods and limitations of current asynchronous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to make federated graph learning more practical and efficient in real-world settings, overcoming the inefficiencies of synchronous communication and adapting asynchronous techniques for graph data.

Method: FedSA-GCL incorporates both inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological properties through the novel ClusterCast mechanism for improved training.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world graph datasets show that FedSA-GCL outperforms 9 baselines by an average of 2.92% (Louvain split) and 3.4% (Metis split).

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL demonstrates robustness and efficiency, providing a promising solution for distributed graph learning in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SINDy-LOM, a novel approach to optimize the library in sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), enhancing model reliability and reducing user effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SINDy methods struggle with the manual design of an appropriate library of basis functions, which is challenging for complex dynamical systems.

Method: The paper proposes a two-layer optimization mechanism: an inner layer for extracting a sparse model and an outer layer to refine the basis functions based on recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy.

Result: The SINDy-LOM approach successfully reduces user burden, ensures good interpretability, and improves model reliability while demonstrating effectiveness on a complex diesel engine airpath system.

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM enhances the traditional SINDy framework by introducing a library optimization mechanism, leading to more accurate and practical dynamical models.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Result: Totally corrective methods can rival heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM, especially with shallow trees, while yielding sparser ensembles and successfully thinning pre-trained ensembles.

Conclusion: LP-based boosting methods have potential to match or outperform state-of-the-art approaches in specific scenarios, but their strengths and limitations depend on the choice of base learner and experimental context.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

TL;DR: The paper presents SiamSA-PPM, a framework combining Siamese learning and Statistical Augmentation to improve predictive process monitoring with augmented data, achieving promising results compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning approaches to predictive process monitoring are often constrained by the lack of variability and small size of real-world event logs.

Method: The framework introduces statistically grounded transformation methods to generate semantically valid trace variants, leveraging control-flow semantics and frequent process patterns. These augmented variants are used in a Siamese learning setup for self-supervised learning of process representations.

Result: SiamSA-PPM shows competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in predicting next activity and final outcomes. Statistical augmentation proves more effective than random transformations, enhancing data variability.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM supports improved training data enrichment for predictive process monitoring, showcasing a promising way to address limitations in real-world event log data.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm to reduce computational load by coarsening unstructured grids using k-means clustering and other techniques, achieving significant reduction in grid points while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern numerical simulations require high computational effort, so there is a need for reducing the size of computational problems without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: The authors propose combining k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization to coarsen unstructured grids.

Result: The algorithm reduced grid points by up to 10 times in two tested PDEs—the linear parabolic equation and the wave equation—while maintaining variable dynamics accuracy at points of interest.

Conclusion: This approach effectively reduces computational complexity and can be generalized to any system governed by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of security regression in Continual Learning (CL)-based malware detection systems and introduces a new penalty method to mitigate its effects while maintaining detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware detection models evolve rapidly due to a high influx of malware samples, making full retraining on large datasets impractical. Continual learning has emerged as an effective solution but introduces risks like security regression, which jeopardizes detection reliability.

Method: The authors propose adapting Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to CL settings, utilizing a regression-aware penalty designed to preserve prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.

Result: Experiments conducted on ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces security regression while upholding high malware detection performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of addressing security regression in CL-based malware detectors and shows that the introduced method improves system reliability without sacrificing detection capabilities.

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

*Janak M. Patel,Milad Ramezankhani,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIDSIT is a novel transformer-based model that addresses challenges in battery SoH estimation involving irregular time-series data, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve battery health monitoring to enhance the operational safety and efficiency of battery-powered systems, addressing challenges posed by irregular discharge cycle data.

Method: The paper introduces the TIDSIT architecture, which combines continuous time embeddings, padded sequences, and temporal attention mechanisms to handle variable-length and irregularly sampled data.

Result: Experiments on the NASA battery degradation dataset demonstrate that TIDSIT reduces prediction error by over 50%, achieving a SoH prediction error under 0.58%.

Conclusion: TIDSIT is a robust solution for battery SoH estimation on irregular time-series data and shows promise for broader health monitoring applications.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

*Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,Leonard Hinckeldey,Riccardo Zamboni,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model-free MARL algorithms often succeed by learning simple conventions rather than addressing the theoretical Dec-POMDP challenges, questioning their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why current MARL methods succeed and whether they test genuine reasoning skills required for Dec-POMDPs.

Method: Conduct a case study to analyze the behavior of agents in MARL environments and evaluate their reliance on conventions versus grounded policies.

Result: Co-adapting agents tend to learn fragile conventions, but they can adapt to grounded policies if environments demand it, showing weakness lies in benchmarks rather than models.

Conclusion: Modern MARL benchmarks may fail to test core Dec-POMDP assumptions, prompting a need for better-designed cooperative environments with observation-grounded and memory-reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

*Etienne Zeudong,Elsa Cardoso-Bihlo,Alex Bihlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, a new variation of HyperDeepONets, significantly reduces trainable parameters and enhances predictive accuracy in operator learning by using low-rank adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high memory and computational costs in HyperDeepONets, which stem from the need for a large number of output parameters for increased expressivity.

Method: Introduce PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets incorporating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decompose the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into smaller, low-rank matrices.

Result: Achieve up to 70% reduction in trainable parameters and consistently improve predictive accuracy and generalization in solving differential equations.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets effectively enhance operator learning by balancing reduced complexity with improved expressivity and generalization.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing scarcity of arable land and the need to enhance agricultural efficiency, where AI can play a transformative role.

Method: It focuses on the application of diffusion models in agricultural tasks such as pest and disease detection, image enhancement, growth prediction, and resource management.

Result: Experiments show that diffusion models enhance accuracy and robustness in complex environments, excelling in data augmentation and denoising.

Conclusion: Diffusion models, despite challenges in computational efficiency, are poised to become vital for sustainable agricultural development and advancing precision agriculture.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As

prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

### [234] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HYPER, a method combining multi-model ensembles and reservoir computing to predict river discharge, showcasing superior performance in data-scarce and data-rich conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate flood prediction and water management is hindered by limited river discharge data in many regions, presenting challenges in achieving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: HYPER uses Bayesian model averaging on conceptual hydrological models combined with reservoir computing for error correction. It links model weights to catchment attributes for generalization in ungauged basins.

Result: HYPER demonstrated comparable accuracy to LSTM models in data-rich scenarios and significantly outperformed LSTM in data-scarce ones, requiring only 5% of the computational time.

Conclusion: The HYPER method is robust, efficient, and versatile, providing a generalizable framework for discharge prediction, particularly for regions with limited data.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

*Leiji Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Xin Li,Yao-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revises the bisimulation metric used in reinforcement learning by addressing its limitations: imprecise reward gap definition and reliance on static weights, introducing adaptive coefficients for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional bisimulation metrics face challenges in capturing distinctive scenarios and rely on static weighting, making them suboptimal for dynamic task settings in reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors redefine the reward gap and introduce update operators with adaptive coefficients for state-action pairs. They provide theoretical convergence guarantees and validate the approach through experiments.

Result: Improved representation distinctiveness and effective performance demonstrated on DeepMind Control and Meta-World benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed revision improves upon conventional bisimulation metrics, yielding better adaptability and representation in reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

TL;DR: The paper proposes GLANCE, a framework enhancing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for heterophilous graphs via logic-guided reasoning, edge pruning, and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with heterophilous graphs due to indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and lack of higher-order structural pattern integration.

Method: GLANCE integrates a logic-guided reasoning layer, attention-based edge pruning, and adaptive clustering to refine graph representations.

Result: GLANCE shows competitive performance on benchmark datasets like Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, providing interpretable, robust solutions.

Conclusion: The framework is lightweight, adaptable, and effectively addresses the challenges of learning from heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

*Magnus Bengtsson,Kenneth Östberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C2G-KD is a data-free knowledge distillation framework that generates synthetic samples based on a teacher model and PCA-based constraints for effective training without requiring real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to knowledge distillation often rely heavily on real data, which may not be available in certain scenarios. This paper seeks to address the challenge by proposing a data-free method leveraging synthetic samples.

Method: The paper uses a class-conditional generator trained with semantic and structural losses while ensuring the generated samples align with class-specific PCA subspaces derived from minimal real data.

Result: C2G-KD successfully demonstrated feasibility on MNIST, where even minimal class structure enabled effective training with synthetic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic samples guided by geometric constraints and knowledge from a teacher model can serve as a practical alternative in data-free scenarios, preserving structural diversity and enabling learning.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [238] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal mathematical framework for diverse learning algorithms and processes using the Price equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover a unified mathematical structure behind different learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection.

Method: The author uses a notational partitioning based on the Price equation to derive a universal law encompassing force, metric, bias, and noise components.

Result: The framework connects various algorithms, such as Bayesian updating, stochastic gradient descent, and natural selection, under a single universal process.

Conclusion: The derived FMB law offers a unified understanding for designing and analyzing learning algorithms across fields by exposing their shared mathematical foundation.

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

### [239] [The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553)
*Jiale Chen,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects GPTQ, a quantization technique for large language models, to Babai's algorithm for solving lattice problems, providing geometric insights and error guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and improve the theoretical underpinnings of GPTQ, an important algorithm for quantizing large language models to enable their efficient deployment.

Method: The authors use a mathematical approach to show that GPTQ is equivalent to Babai's nearest plane algorithm on a lattice defined by the model's input Hessian matrix when executed in a specific order.

Result: The equivalence provides a geometric interpretation of GPTQ's error propagation and links its errors to worst-case bounds from lattice algorithms, offering theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: By relating GPTQ to established lattice algorithms, the paper offers a theoretical foundation for GPTQ and suggests that advancements in lattice methods can enhance future quantization techniques.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

*Ethan Pronovost,Neha Boloor,Peter Schleede,Noureldin Hendy,Andres Morales,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient SE(2) invariant transformer architecture for spatial data processing in autonomous driving, achieving linear memory scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial data processing is crucial for tasks like motion forecasting and planning in autonomous driving. Existing SE(2) invariant methods lack scalability due to quadratic memory requirements.

Method: The paper introduces SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention that scales linearly in memory, leveraging transformer-based architecture advantageous in large models.

Result: The proposed method improves performance and scalability compared to non-invariant architectures in experimental trials.

Conclusion: Efficient SE(2) invariant transformers are both practical and beneficial for autonomous driving tasks, addressing memory and scalability issues.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-level conditional diffusion model for de novo protein design, improving upon existing methods by integrating both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient protein generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in reliable generation of novel and functional protein sequences using conditional diffusion models, especially for de novo protein design, considering the hierarchical and multi-level structures of proteins.

Method: The study proposes a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that simultaneously generates representations at different levels, combining sequence-level and structure-level information. It also introduces a new evaluation metric, Protein-MMD, to measure quality and functional similarity of generated proteins.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework effectively generates proteins that meet conditional constraints. The evaluation metric, Protein-MMD, successfully captures both distributional and functional similarities, improving upon existing approaches.

Conclusion: The multi-level conditional diffusion model provides a promising approach for reliable and functional de novo protein design, supported by the robust evaluation metric Protein-MMD.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Motivation: To enable robots and embodied agents to effectively collaborate with humans by addressing challenges arising from continuous state-action spaces and physical constraints.

Method: The authors created the Moving Out benchmark and proposed a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), which enhances agent diversity and understanding of action outcomes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration scenarios.

Conclusion: The introduction of the Moving Out benchmark and the BASS method provides an effective framework for improving human-AI collaboration in physical environments with constrained dynamics.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI

from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going

platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be
deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity
classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant
features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and
data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test

TL;DR: Neuromorphic computing offers energy-efficient computation by leveraging sparse and scalable algorithms, making it distinct from conventional systems like CPUs and GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish neuromorphic computing as a viable alternative to conventional architectures by exploring its computational and energy scaling advantages.

Method: Comparison of scaling properties: time, space, and energy for neuromorphic vs. conventional systems, analyzing theoretical and algorithmic performance.

Result: Neuromorphic computing scales differently in energy, aligning well with algorithms with sparse activity proportional to the objective function, such as iterative optimization and Monte Carlo sampling.

Conclusion: NMC is a programmable, general-purpose computing paradigm better suited for specific classes of sparse and scalable algorithms than traditional systems.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

*Felix Arnold,Maxence Bouvier,Ryan Amaudruz,Renzo Andri,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve power efficiency in fixed-point multipliers through decomposition and reformatting, achieving significant power savings in AI workloads while maintaining compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for power-efficient multiplier designs, especially for AI tasks with input values centered around zero.

Method: The proposed method involves decomposing fixed-point multipliers into an encoder and multiplier block, optimizing them independently. The encoder converts operands into sign magnitude representation for power-efficient multiplication.

Result: Experiments show that a 4-bit multiplier designed with the method reduces switching activity by up to 12.9% (realistic case) and up to 33% (specific input range). An additional optimization step yields a further 5-10% power efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves power efficiency in multipliers without altering computation correctness, making it suitable for production systems, particularly in AI contexts.

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

TL;DR: This paper provides a unified analysis of Echo-State Networks (ESNs), addressing stability, memory, and expressive power using dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, and neuroscience insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESNs demonstrate efficient transformation of temporal streams but lack unified insights regarding their stability, memory, and expressive power, prompting this comprehensive analysis.

Method: The authors applied functional analysis, random attractor theory, and neuroscientific findings to analyze ESN properties, proving fundamental connections like fading-memory, universality, and computational capacity trade-offs.

Result: Key findings include proofs of fading-memory property tied to Echo-State Property, universality of ESNs in approximating causal filters, and computational capacity analysis using Lyapunov spectra and topology adjustments.

Conclusion: ESNs possess remarkable efficiency and design rules informed by mathematics and neuroscience, explaining their success and practicality despite modestly-sized reservoirs.

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish program equivalence in higher-order languages, particularly with probabilistic features, using a consistent method applicable across different languages and notions of conformance.

Method: The authors introduce Abstract Higher-Order Specification (AHOS) for operational semantics and use fibrations to model behavioural conformances. They prove a fundamental congruence theorem under general categorical conditions.

Result: They demonstrate that under natural conditions, the greatest behavioural conformance forms a congruence in their framework. This applies to bisimilarity and behavioural pseudometrics in probabilistic higher-order languages.

Conclusion: By developing a categorical framework, the paper generalizes Howe's method, enabling uniform and sound reasoning about program equivalence in diverse settings, including probabilistic systems.

Abstract: Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural
equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of
languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions
of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most
notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive
reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a
program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the
language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as
\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific
language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a
uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal
dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled
by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very
general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of
behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via
fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental
congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the
categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an
AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a
congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and
behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.

*Mingfeng Yuan,Letian Wang,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a zero-shot vision-language navigation framework for robots, leveraging multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret complex linguistic instructions and translate them into actionable trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between language descriptions and actual robot actions for navigation tasks in open-world settings.

Method: The approach combines MLLMs with vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view value maps, integrating semantic understanding with spatial data for seamless navigation.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates robust navigation capabilities in diverse scenarios using AVD datasets and Husky robot testing, showcasing resilience to errors and ambiguities.

Conclusion: The integration of MLLMs and perception models proves effective for enabling robots to comprehend and act on free-form navigation instructions in real-world scenarios, marking progress in open-world robotic navigation.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

### [251] [Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18070)
*Behzad Zamani,Jochen Trumpf,Chris Manzie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach for independent subsystems, addressing issues in shared state estimation using the Covariance Intersection algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient state and error covariance estimation in systems composed of independent subsystems, particularly when interdependent relative measurements introduce complexity.

Method: The authors propose a modular update mechanism for individual subsystem states and error covariance estimates, integrating the Covariance Intersection algorithm to prevent information redundancy. They derive an alternative CI approach based on least squares estimation.

Result: The method is applied to the robot-landmark localization problem and benchmarked in simulations against a monolithic joint state filter, showing trade-offs and demonstrating robustness under reduced communication scenarios.

Conclusion: The modular approach is effective and adaptable, offering an alternative that balances performance and communication requirements for problems like robot-landmark localization.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standalone model-based or learning-based frameworks in maintaining robust locomotion under uncertainties.

Method: The framework integrates learning-based residual modules with model-based components like the footstep planner and dynamic model. A modular structure is used to enhance learning efficiency and control performance.

Result: The approach improves locomotion robustness and nominal controller robustness against parameter tuning. It is validated on a real quadrupedal robot, which successfully maintains balance and tracks velocity under uncertainties.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework enhances control performance and learning efficiency while demonstrating practicality in real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of both
model-based and learning-based frameworks to achieve robust locomotion. The
residual modules are integrated with each corresponding part of the model-based
framework, a footstep planner and dynamic model designed using heuristics, to
complement performance degradation caused by a model mismatch. By utilizing a
modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each
residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in
environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning
efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our
proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides
additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to
parameter tuning. To investigate the feasibility of our framework, we
demonstrated residual modules combined with model predictive control in a real
quadrupedal robot. Despite uncertainties beyond the simulation, the robot
successfully maintains balance and tracks the commanded velocity.

TL;DR: This paper describes a UAV-based system for assisting search and rescue missions by detecting, recognizing, and tracking individuals using deep learning models and autonomous navigation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The system aims to improve search and rescue missions by developing a UAV subsystem capable of detecting and tracking individuals autonomously, while including specific features like face recognition and safe-distance tracking.

Method: The approach integrates UAVs with ROS2 framework, employing YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking keypoints and dlib library for face recognition. System identification and PD controllers enhance tracking accuracy using IMU measurement data.

Result: Initial experiments on 14 known individuals demonstrated successful real-time detection, face recognition, and tracking capabilities.

Conclusion: The subsystem shows potential for real-time rescue applications, with plans to expand its capabilities for field use through GPS-guided navigation and integration with experimental UAVs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and
integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations
planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents MoRPI-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework for improving inertial-based navigation in mobile robots, achieving significant accuracy enhancements (85%) over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots require precise navigation capabilities, especially in environments where satellite navigation or cameras are unavailable. Traditional inertial sensor-based solutions suffer from significant drift, affecting accuracy.

Method: The authors leverage a snake-like slithering motion of robots to enhance inertial signal-to-noise ratio. They propose a physics-informed neural network (MoRPI-PINN) that integrates physical laws into the training process to improve navigation accuracy.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrated that MoRPI-PINN improved navigation accuracy by over 85% compared to other alternatives.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN offers a lightweight, effective navigation solution for mobile robots, suitable for edge devices and various practical applications.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the MediaPipe algorithm for facial landmark detection using a robotic arm under surgical lighting to improve accuracy for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address challenges such as variable lighting conditions and flexible detection positions that affect the use of face detection algorithms in medical fields like neurosurgery and plastic surgery.

Method: The study tests the MediaPipe algorithm in a controlled environment with a robotic arm adjusting positions, while surgical lighting and a phantom model remain fixed.

Result: The results indicate improved accuracy of facial landmark detection at larger yaw and pitch angles under surgical lighting, although increased dispersion occurs due to imprecise detection of certain facial landmarks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that integrating the MediaPipe algorithm into medical procedures can enhance detection performance, especially under challenging conditions like surgical lighting.

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReSem3D, a framework integrating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address spatial constraint challenges in robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle limitations in spatial constraint modeling for robotics, including coarse semantics, lack of real-time planning, and reduced robustness in diverse environments.

Method: ReSem3D leverages hierarchical recursive reasoning between VFMs and MLLMs for real-time construction of 3D spatial constraints, combining part-level extraction and region-level refinement stages from RGB-D inputs.

Result: Experiments in household and chemical lab environments show the framework’s ability to perform diverse tasks without prior training, demonstrating adaptability and generalization.

Conclusion: ReSem3D unifies task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation, advancing the application of VFMs and MLLMs for real-world environments.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaRPG addresses manipulation challenges for diverse articulated objects by utilizing foundation models to enhance visual affordance generalization and reasoning, achieving strong cross-category generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in robotic manipulation of articulated objects, including geometric diversity and functional variations, which complicate visual perception and adaptive action strategies.

Method: AdaRPG employs foundation models to extract object parts, trains an affordance model on a part-level annotation dataset, and uses foundation models to generate high-level control codes based on part affordance inference.

Result: AdaRPG demonstrates enhanced performance and generalization in simulating and manipulating novel articulated object categories both in simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enhances robotic manipulation of varied articulated objects, showcasing its effectiveness in improving visual perception and adaptive action strategies using foundation models.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AF-RLIO, a sensor fusion approach for robust robotic navigation in complex environments, integrating radar, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the limitations of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS in challenging environments (e.g., smoke, tunnels, adverse weather).

Method: A three-module approach: (1) radar-assisted LiDAR pre-processing for dynamic point removal and degraded-condition detection, (2) a dynamic-aware multimodal odometry tightly coupling LiDAR and IMU, and (3) factor graph optimization to balance odometry and GPS data.

Result: AF-RLIO shows superior performance in datasets and real-world tests in challenging conditions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive fusion method effectively enhances navigation accuracy and robustness of autonomous robots in degraded environments.

Abstract: In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in
complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges
such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the
performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the
overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges,
we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D
millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to
leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry
estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules.
Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in
removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are
degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects
appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it
with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor
graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data,
constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments,
demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in
challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D reconstruction and camera tracking by introducing surface-aligned Gaussian representations, addressing depth consistency issues in conventional systems.

Method: The method incorporates surface-aligned Gaussian disks into a Generalized ICP framework with anisotropic covariance and a geometry-aware loss for photometric, depth, and normal consistency.

Result: The system achieves high localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, and visual fidelity, outperforming existing SLAM systems on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging surface-aligned representations and geometry-aware loss functions, G2S-ICP SLAM provides advanced real-time performance in 3D reconstruction and pose tracking for RGB-D SLAM applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry-aware RGB-D Gaussian Splatting
SLAM system, named G2S-ICP SLAM. The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D
reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing
each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local
tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk
aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth
interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D
ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this
representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian
disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance
prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we
propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal
consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems
in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while
maintaining the rendering quality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC), which combines Linear MPC and neural network-based compensation for better vehicle trajectory tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance vehicle trajectory tracking strategies, addressing limitations in Pure Pursuit (PP) Control and overcoming modeling trade-offs between capturing nonlinear dynamics and computational efficiency in traditional MPC.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach with two MPCs: LMPC generates baseline control input, and a neural network-based RKMPC compensates for residual errors. Final control derives from combining these inputs.

Result: Experimental results on simulation and physical platforms show significant improvements in trajectory tracking compared to LMPC, with reductions in lateral and heading errors and better steering stability.

Conclusion: RKMPC outperforms traditional methods, offering efficiency with reduced training data and superior control performance, while maintaining interpretability and reliability of mechanistic models.

Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure
Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy
fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control
actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its
control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.
Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between
capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often
resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.
This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a
Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input
based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC
calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by
adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and
interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance
optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the
Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH
racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the
training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)
while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,
RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by
8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The
implementation code is available at: https://github.com/ZJU-DDRX/Residual

*David Blanco-Mulero,Júlia Borràs,Carme Torras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pre-dressing step for robotic-assisted dressing that unfolds garments using learned manipulation primitives and visual classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the assumption in previous works that garments are unfolded, and tackle the real-world challenge of folded garments in medical settings.

Method: Imitation learning is used to train robots on three manipulation primitives, and a visual classifier is employed to categorize garment states during the unfolding process.

Result: The evaluation shows that highly dynamic motions are ineffective, but combining motions enhances the efficiency of garment unfolding.

Conclusion: Incorporating the pre-dressing step improves the effectiveness of robotic-assisted dressing in clinical scenarios with folded garments.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly aid both
patients as well as healthcare personnel, reducing the workload and improving
the efficiency in clinical settings. While substantial progress has been made
in robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are
already unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and
aprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional
unfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process
of unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation
learning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and
low acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to
categorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We
conduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well
as their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not
effective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of

### [262] [A Novel Monte-Carlo Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning Method for the Efficient Path Planning of Remote Sensing Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18462)
*Alghalya Al-Hajri,Ejmen Al-Ubejdij,Aiman Erbad,Ali Safa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Monte Carlo optimization framework to optimize sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection, minimizing path length and maximizing signal reconstruction accuracy through compressed sensing and dictionary learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing robotic sampling trajectories in environmental monitoring, leveraging compressed sensing to reduce sensor measurements and improve efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes a Monte Carlo optimization framework that integrates Dictionary Learning to create data-driven sparsifying transforms, enhancing signal reconstruction accuracy and reducing the number of samples collected by robots.

Result: Experiments with $NO_2$ pollution maps show the method reduces robot travel distance to less than 10% of full coverage and improves reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines compressed sensing and dictionary learning to achieve efficient and accurate robotic environmental data collection, outperforming existing methods in both travel optimization and data reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)
methods.

*Sait Sovukluk,Grazia Zambella,Tobias Egle,Christian Ott*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares two humanoid robot control methods: inverse dynamics whole-body control (ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC), focusing on their robustness to external challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the strengths and weaknesses of ID-WBC and PB-WBC for humanoid robots under non-ideal conditions.

Method: Conduct experimental comparisons using a humanoid robot with various tasks like swing foot control, squatting, and jumping.

Result: The paper presents observed performance differences in robustness and stability, linking them to controller formulations.

Conclusion: Both ID-WBC and PB-WBC have unique advantages, and their suitability depends on specific robotic tasks and conditions.

Abstract: This paper studies the experimental comparison of two different whole-body
control formulations for humanoid robots: inverse dynamics whole-body control
(ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC). The two controllers
fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task
acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity
considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal
conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,
sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact
conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the
two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and
orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,
and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic
differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's
advantages and disadvantages.

### [264] [How Software Engineers Engage with AI: A Pragmatic Process Model and Decision Framework Grounded in Industry Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17930)
*Vahid Garousi,Zafar Jafarov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines how software engineers interact with AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT in daily tasks, proposing a process model and a 2D decision framework to optimize human-AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how software engineers use AI tools in daily tasks, address challenges in trust, refinement, and rejection of AI-generated outputs, and provide structured guidance for improved collaboration.

Method: They developed a pragmatic process model and a 2D decision framework based on industry observations and practitioner reports in Turkiye and Azerbaijan.

Result: The study provided insights into real-world AI-assisted SE activities, illustrating developers' strategies in using AI with human oversight.

Conclusion: Structured models and frameworks for AI-assisted software engineering can enhance deliberate and effective use, improving collaboration and decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: The paper compares 11 automated tools across 9 rigor criteria to identify effective solutions addressing scientific transparency and reproducibility problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reproducibility crisis caused by lack of standardization and transparency in scientific reporting.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative study of 11 automated tools against 9 rigor criteria related to transparency and reproducibility.

Result: Some tools excelled in specific criteria like detecting open data, while a combination of tools outperformed individual tools in detecting inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Conclusion: Insights and recommendations were provided for developers and stakeholders to improve rigor and transparency tools; the code and data are publicly accessible.

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data

TL;DR: The paper studies how generative AI is discussed, adopted, and integrated in open-source game development, using GitHub issue discussions as the analysis medium, and compares it with traditional AI and non-AI topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how generative AI is adopted in real-world scenarios, especially in open-source game development, and to compare its impact with traditional AI approaches.

Method: The authors construct a dataset from open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics on GitHub. They use open card sorting and thematic analysis on a stratified sample of GitHub issues, labeling them by type and content for comparative analysis.

Result: The dataset and annotations reveal distinct usage patterns, developer concerns, and integration practices for generative AI compared to traditional AI and non-AI workflows in open-source game development.

Conclusion: Generative AI is reshaping workflows and creating unique pain points for developers in open-source game projects, differing from traditional AI approaches and broadening developmental practices.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

Motivation: To help software organizations mitigate software supply chain attack techniques by aligning P-SSCRM tasks with MITRE ATT&CK and other frameworks.

Method: The authors created mappings through four independent strategies and aligned P-SSCRM tasks with 10 prominent frameworks.

Result: A comprehensive mapping was developed between P-SSCRM tasks, MITRE ATT&CK, and other government and industry frameworks.

Conclusion: The mapping enables improved mitigation strategies for software supply chain security by bridging frameworks and standardizing proactive risk management practices.

Abstract: The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK)

(P-SSCRM) Task mapping described in this document helps software organizations
to determine how different tasks mitigate the attack techniques of software
supply chain attacks. The mapping was created through four independent
strategies to find agreed-upon mappings. Because each P-SSCRM task is mapped to
one or more tasks from the 10 frameworks, the mapping we provide is also a
mapping between MITRE ATT&CK and other prominent government and industry
frameworks.

### [268] [Factors Impacting Faculty Adoption of Project-Based Learning in Computing Education: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18039)
*Ahmad D. Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenges and enablers for computing educators adopting project-based learning (PjBL) in their courses, using data from surveys and thematic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inconsistent adoption of PjBL by computing educators, despite its known benefits for student learning.

Method: Mixed-methods approach combining online surveys (quantitative and qualitative data) and thematic analysis.

Result: Faculty adoption of PjBL faces barriers such as time, funding, project design, and lack of support, but can be facilitated through professional development, peer support, institutional incentives, and industry collaborations.

Conclusion: Systemic support structures are essential to help faculty implement and scale PjBL in computing education effectively.

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores GitHub Actions workflows in open-source repositories to study their complexity, structure, and adherence to best practices, aiming to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical understanding of how real-world CI workflows, particularly GitHub Actions workflows, align with best practices and simplicity goals in CI.

Method: The study analyzes a large dataset of GitHub Actions workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories to identify complexities, structuring patterns, compliance with best practices, and language-specific design differences in CI pipelines.

Result: The findings are anticipated to showcase both strong adherence to and deviations from GitHub Actions' best practices, offering insights into areas that require better documentation and clearer guidelines.

Conclusion: The research provides actionable insights into improving CI workflows and guidelines, benefiting both open-source developers and CI services to enhance clarity and simplicity in their practices.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the impact of identifier name similarity in software projects and presents a preliminary taxonomy of its different forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in software development caused by poorly chosen or overly similar identifier names, which can impede comprehension and collaboration.

Method: The authors conducted an exploratory study to categorize different types of identifier name similarities and developed a preliminary taxonomy for analysis.

Result: Preliminary findings suggest that identifier name similarity can lead to misunderstandings in programming contexts and the taxonomy highlights various forms these similarities can take.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as an initial framework to study and mitigate issues related to identifier similarity, promoting enhanced program comprehension and collaboration among developers.

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

*Yujie Ma,Lili Quan,Xiaofei Xie,Qiang Hu,Jiongchi Yu,Yao Zhang,Sen Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the security risks in the supply chains of LLM-based systems and introduces a comprehensive dataset for benchmarking these risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing proliferation of LLM systems and the lack of benchmarks to systematically analyze their supply chain risks.

Method: The authors created a dataset of 3,859 LLM applications, analyzing interdependencies among models, datasets, libraries, and infrastructure.

Result: They identified 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, 9,862 libraries, and highlighted 1,555 security issues across these components.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for systematic security evaluations of LLM supply chains and provides recommendations for safer systems.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

TL;DR: NoCode-bench evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in translating natural language-driven feature requests into functional code, revealing significant limitations in their current capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the potential of LLMs in enabling natural language-driven no-code development by creating a realistic benchmark based on real-world software documentation.

Method: The authors developed NoCode-bench, a benchmark with 634 tasks derived from 10 projects, featuring paired documentation updates and corresponding code implementations. They also created a subset called NoCode-bench Verified for reliable evaluation.

Result: LLMs currently achieve a low success rate of 15.79% on feature addition tasks, struggling with cross-file editing, codebase comprehension, and tool integration.

Conclusion: LLMs are not yet capable of fully supporting natural language-driven no-code development, but NoCode-bench provides a foundation for improving research and development in this area.

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

Motivation: Researchers and software engineers face challenges in creating resource-intensive and high-quality metadata for FAIR principles compliance, demanding an efficient solution.

Method: SMECS integrates metadata extraction from online repositories (e.g., GitHub) with a user-friendly interactive curation interface and export capabilities.

Result: Usability tests confirm SMECS delivers a satisfactory user experience and facilitates metadata creation and curation.

Conclusion: SMECS aids research software FAIRification by making metadata creation easier and more efficient, thus supporting enhanced findability and reusability.

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to streamline ADAS and autonomous systems development to reduce compliance cycles and testing time.

Method: The approach integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation and requirements validation, coupled with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for regulation-aligned test scenarios.

Result: The system generates test scenario code and platform-specific implementations efficiently, leveraging automated summarization and regulation adherence.

Conclusion: This workflow demonstrates significant potential for faster, automated development of ADAS/autonomous vehicle functionalities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 885 EAIR system bugs, categorizes them into symptoms, causes, and affected modules, and provides insights for better bug prediction and repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the lack of understanding of system bugs in Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots and to improve techniques for diagnosing and repairing them.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic study by analyzing 885 EAIR system bugs from 80 projects, classifying the bugs into 18 causes, 15 symptoms, and 13 affected modules.

Result: The study identified eight EAIR-specific symptoms characterized by functional failures and physical hazards, as well as eight causes specific to issues in AI-agent reasoning and decision-making.

Conclusion: A mapping between causes and affected modules was created to help researchers focus on modules prone to specific bug types, aiding in precise and efficient bug handling.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

TL;DR: Develops Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing tool that automates the creation of rational fuzz drivers, minimizes resource use, improves coverage, and discovers new bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately adhere to library usage conventions, generating suboptimal fuzz drivers and wasting resources.

Method: Introduced Scheduzz, leveraging LLMs to extract API usage constraints and employing a dual scheduling framework to optimize API combinations and fuzz drivers.

Result: Scheduzz reduced computational overhead, achieved up to 1.89x higher coverage than other methods, and found 33 new bugs, three of which were given CVEs.

Conclusion: Scheduzz effectively advances automated library fuzzing by improving the rationality, efficiency, and bug discovery of fuzzing approaches.

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated test generation using language models often produces incorrect tests, which, if fixed, could add significant testing value.

Method: YATE combines rule-based static analysis and re-prompting to repair incorrect tests generated by language models.

Result: YATE improves test coverage by an average of 32.06% more lines and kills 21.77% more mutants compared to plain LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: YATE is an effective and cost-efficient approach for enhancing test quality and coverage compared with existing LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

### [278] [Gotta catch 'em all! Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319)
*Jesse Maarleveld,Jiapan Guo,Daniel Feitosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on broadening file localisation from bug-specific issues to a general approach for all issue types, introducing a dataset pipeline and performance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in bug-centric file localisation research and develop general-purpose methods for all types of software issues.

Method: A data pipeline was developed to create issue file localisation datasets, with performance baselined using traditional information retrieval methods and statistical bias analysis.

Result: Results highlighted poor performance of bug-specific heuristics for general issues, project-dependent differences, and the minor impact of identifiers in file localisation.

Conclusion: General-purpose, project-tunable models are needed for effective file localisation across diverse issue types.

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

### [279] [FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339)
*Nils Bosbach,Meik Schmidt,Lukas Jünger,Matthias Berthold,Rainer Leupers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework enabling FMI integration with SystemC virtual platforms (VPs) for co-simulation, enhancing cross-tool interoperability and realistic software testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systems complexity demands thorough testing and integration of multiple simulation tools for hardware and environment interactions. SystemC VPs lack FMI support, limiting co-simulation capabilities.

Method: A novel framework was developed to enable interaction between SystemC-based VPs and FMI. A case study demonstrated the integration of external environment values, like temperature, into SystemC simulations.

Result: Unmodified target software can receive realistic external input during VP simulations, improving software testing prior to physical hardware availability.

Conclusion: The integration of FMI and SystemC enhances VP utility for co-simulation, accelerating certifications like ISO 26262 and facilitating robust software development.

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

### [280] [Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476)
*Busra Icoz,Goksel Biricik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs to automate code review, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code review is subjective and time-consuming, and existing LLMs lack sufficient logical reasoning capabilities to fully automate the process.

Method: Integrates symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs, testing models like CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT using the CodexGlue dataset.

Result: The hybrid approach demonstrated improved accuracy and efficiency in automated code review compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs is effective for automating code review, offering better performance than using LLMs alone.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

### [281] [A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515)
*Zezhou Yang,Ting Peng,Cuiyun Gao,Chaozheng Wang,Hailiang Huang,Yuetang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion in a closed-source industrial setting, using WeChat's codebase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of distribution shift between open-source and proprietary codebases, improving code completion capabilities in a closed-source environment.

Method: An empirical study of identifier-based and similarity-based RAG methods, employing lexical (BM25) and semantic (GTE-Qwen) retrieval techniques with 26 LLMs. Key findings were validated via a developer survey.

Result: Similarity-based RAG performed better overall, especially with advanced retrieval techniques. Combining lexical and semantic retrieval proved optimal, leveraging complementary strengths.

Conclusion: RAG methods are effective in closed-source settings and provide practical utility, with advanced retrieval techniques showing significant promise.

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

*Semih Eren,Deniz Kucukahmetler,Nico Scherf*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical recurrent multimodal model to map pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series, achieving strong performance in predicting cortical responses to movies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to accurately predict distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli by developing models integrating visual, auditory, and semantic information over time.

Method: The study employs modality-specific bidirectional RNNs, a fusion mechanism for temporal dynamics, and subject-specific heads, using a curriculum training strategy emphasizing different cortical regions.

Result: The system ranked third on the Algonauts 2025 challenge leaderboard, achieving high correlation scores (overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and peak mean r = 0.63 for single parcels). It excelled particularly for challenging subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a robust, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain decoding tasks, demonstrating strong predictive capability for cortical responses.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future
multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWICCA, an extension of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for streaming data, using a PCA algorithm and sliding window approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CCA cannot handle streaming or real-time data efficiently, necessitating a scalable and real-time extension.

Method: The proposed SWICCA algorithm integrates streaming PCA with sliding window samples to estimate CCA components in real time, supported by theoretical guarantees and simulations.

Result: SWICCA performs well in high-dimensional streaming data scenarios, as demonstrated by numerical simulations and real-data examples.

Conclusion: SWICCA is a scalable and efficient approach for applying CCA in real-time, streaming contexts, suitable for extremely high dimensions.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated
sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window
Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a
streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses
these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the
CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide
numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a
theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable
to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that
demonstrates this capability.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel two-armed bandit framework to enhance A/B testing, utilizing doubly robust estimation, bandit-based test construction, and permutation for p-value computation, achieving stronger results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve A/B testing in policy evaluation and product deployment by addressing limitations in current causal inference and reinforcement learning methods.

Method: The approach involves creating pseudo-outcomes with doubly robust estimation, using a two-armed bandit framework for constructing test statistics, and employing permutation-based methods for p-value calculation.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior efficacy through theoretical backing, simulations, and real-world implementation in ridesharing data compared to typical methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances testing power in A/B experimentation and holds promise for broader adoption in technology companies.

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing
methods.

*Stefan Klus,Jason J. Bramburger*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper links stochastic processes with a mathematical concept called graphons, enabling advanced spectral clustering and signal analysis methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently analyze stochastic signals evolving over time using mathematical tools that extend beyond conventional approaches.

Method: Introduction of transfer operators (Koopman and Perron–Frobenius) on graphons, estimation methods for these operators, and their application in clustering and graphon reconstruction.

Result: Data-driven spectral clustering methods extended to graphons, reconstruction of graphons and transition probabilities, validated through synthetic and real-world signal analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges stochastic signal analysis and graphon-based methods, unlocking new possibilities for data-driven clustering and signal reconstruction.

Abstract: Many signals evolve in time as a stochastic process, randomly switching
between states over discretely sampled time points. Here we make an explicit
link between the underlying stochastic process of a signal that can take on a
bounded continuum of values and a random walk process on a graphon. Graphons
are infinite-dimensional objects that represent the limit of convergent
sequences of graphs whose size tends to infinity. We introduce transfer
operators, such as the Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators, associated with
random walk processes on graphons and then illustrate how these operators can
be estimated from signal data and how their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can
be used for detecting clusters, thereby extending conventional spectral
clustering methods from graphs to graphons. Furthermore, we show that it is
also possible to reconstruct transition probability densities and, if the
random walk process is reversible, the graphon itself using only the signal.
The resulting data-driven methods are applied to a variety of synthetic and
real-world signals, including daily average temperatures and stock index
values.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of publicly released machine learning models to training data reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the major vulnerability in modern ML methods where adversaries reconstruct information from training data of released models.

Method: It builds a mathematical framework, uses maximum mean discrepancy equivalence, and outlines a score-matching approach for reconstruction.

Result: The approach is applicable to Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, with the Bayesian treatment being novel in the literature.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of vulnerabilities in ML and provides tools for reconstructing data in released models.

Abstract: Publicly releasing the specification of a model with its trained parameters
means an adversary can attempt to reconstruct information about the training
data via training data reconstruction attacks, a major vulnerability of modern
machine learning methods. This paper makes three primary contributions:
establishing a mathematical framework to express the problem, characterising
the features of the training data that are vulnerable via a maximum mean
discrepancy equivalance and outlining a score matching framework for
reconstructing data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, the former is a
first in the literature.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents DriftMoE, an efficient online Mixture-of-Experts model for adapting to concept drift in data streams, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing adaptive ensemble methods, which often rely on coarse mechanisms and fail to fully leverage expert knowledge, in learning from non-stationary data streams with concept drift.

Method: The proposed method, DriftMoE, is an online Mixture-of-Experts setup consisting of a co-trained neural router and incremental Hoeffding tree experts. It employs a feedback loop where the router selects experts for prediction and refines itself using correctness masks, enabling expert specialization.

Result: DriftMoE demonstrated competitive performance across nine benchmark datasets with abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts, in both multi-class and task-based configurations.

Conclusion: DriftMoE provides an efficient, innovative, and principled approach to handling concept drift, with publicly available resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available
in our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguel-ceadar/drift-moe.

*Keyi Li,Yuval Kluger,Boris Landa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate noise magnitudes and correct pairwise Euclidean distances distorted by heteroskedastic noise, especially in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distortions caused by heteroskedastic noise in pairwise Euclidean distance calculations lead to misrepresentation of data geometry in machine learning and data analysis.

Method: The authors developed a principled, hyperparameter-free approach to jointly estimate noise magnitudes and correct distances, with theoretical guarantees on estimation errors.

Result: Experiments showed that the method reliably estimates distances in complex scenarios and improves robustness in distance-based computations, including single-cell RNA sequencing applications.

Conclusion: The approach enhances distance accuracy and aids in accurate downstream analyses, particularly in high-dimensional and heteroskedastic settings.

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

TL;DR: The paper reexamines Kit Fine's work on types of ignorance, addressing issues of definability around Rumsfeld ignorance by redefining relationships between accessibility relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the problem of definability and logical triviality in Kit Fine's prior work on types of ignorance, particularly Rumsfeld ignorance.

Method: Assuming different accessibility relations for implicit knowledge operators and deriving new axiomatizations over specific bi-frame classes to address definability issues.

Result: New axiomatizations for ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance that avoid previous definability problems while retaining most validities.

Conclusion: By addressing the definability issues and distinguishing accessibility relations, the results refine the logical framework and provide new insights into Kit Fine's findings.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

*Arindam Ghosh,Mark Fuhs,Bongjun Kim,Anurag Chowdhury,Monika Woszczyna*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper extends a joint ASR + SD framework to speaker-role diarization (RD), refining training, introducing task-specific predictors, and improving decoding accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speaker diarization assigns generic labels, but speaker-role diarization (RD) is more practical for applications like doctor-patient scenarios. Current joint ASR + SD models need enhancements to handle RD.

Method: The authors simplify the training process using forced alignment and cross-entropy loss, introduce separate task-specific predictors for word and role prediction, and utilize RD posterior activity to improve ASR decoding.

Result: The proposed methods enhanced speaker-role diarization by improving the distinction of roles and reducing small-word deletion errors in ASR decoding.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates significant advancements in speaker-role diarization, tailoring training and prediction for more accurate and application-relevant outcomes.

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

TL;DR: CHiME-7 and 8 challenges focus on distant speech recognition and diarization, emphasizing generalizable end-to-end systems, guided source separation, and speaker diarization refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance the state-of-the-art in distant speech recognition and diarization, addressing challenges posed by complex scenarios and spontaneous conversational speech.

Method: The challenges evaluate multi-channel ASR and diarization systems using newly designed datasets, metrics, and baseline systems, with analysis of trends observed across diverse participant submissions.

Result: Findings include shifts toward end-to-end ASR, reliance on guided source separation, emphasis on target-speaker diarization, and large-language models mitigating transcription errors.

Conclusion: Accurately handling spontaneous, challenging acoustic speech remains difficult despite system advancements, but the analysis provides insights into promising methods and current limitations.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating non-invasive diagnosis of voice disorders using AI can substantially enhance healthcare quality, but the lack of interpretability in traditional deep neural networks limits trust in clinical use.

Method: The study focuses on concept-based explainable AI models like Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept Embedding Model (CEM) for diagnosing voice disorders.

Result: The concept-based models achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while providing interpretable decision-making processes.

Conclusion: Explainable AI models offer a promising solution to balance performance and interpretability, enhancing trust and usability in diagnosing voice disorders.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

### [293] [VERIRAG: Healthcare Claim Verification via Statistical Audit in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17948)
*Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shusen Liu,Christine Klymko,Shashank Kushwaha,Derek Shi,Wesam Sakla,Sainyam Galhotra,Ruben Glatt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VERIRAG, a framework designed to enhance the credibility of evidence used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly in clinical decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems in clinical decision-making lack the ability to assess the scientific quality of retrieved evidence, exposing users to potentially unreliable claims or retracted studies.

Method: VERIRAG employs three key components: (i) an 11-point checklist ('Veritable') to evaluate methodological rigor, (ii) a HV Score for aggregating weighted evidence quality and diversity, and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold based on the extraordinariness of claims.

Result: Across four diverse datasets, VERIRAG systematically outperformed baseline methods, achieving F1 scores between 0.53 and 0.65, with improvements ranging from 10 to 14 points compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VERIRAG provides a robust framework for filtering and weighing scientific evidence in RAG systems, enhancing their reliability for clinical decision support applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

### [294] [LLM-based Embedders for Prior Case Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18455)
*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLM-based text embedders for Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) to overcome challenges like limitations of input length and lack of legal training data, and demonstrates their superiority over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle two challenges in Prior Case Retrieval (PCR): limitations with lengthy legal texts in transformer models and issues with the lack of legal training data.

Method: The authors leverage LLM-based text embedders, which support longer input lengths and operate in an unsupervised manner, bypassing the need for large training datasets.

Result: Their evaluation on four PCR benchmark datasets demonstrates that LLM-based text embedders outperform traditional IR methods like BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Conclusion: LLM-based text embedders are effective for overcoming key hurdles in PCR, proving to be superior by combining performance and adaptability, even in scenarios with limited legal data resources.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

### [295] [Fashion-AlterEval: A Dataset for Improved Evaluation of Conversational Recommendation Systems with Alternative Relevant Items](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18017)
*Maria Vlachou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes improvements for user simulators in Conversational Recommendation Systems by incorporating human judgment-based alternative item annotations, allowing simulated users to express preferences flexibly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing user simulators in CRS, which focus on a single target item and assume unlimited patience over numerous interaction turns.

Method: Fashion-AlterEval dataset introduces annotations capturing human judgments about alternative items, and two novel meta-user simulators are proposed to leverage these annotations, enabling dynamic user preferences and patience levels.

Result: Experiments show that using alternative item knowledge improves evaluation accuracy for CRS models, highlighting the advantage of adaptive and alternative-focused simulators in user satisfaction.

Conclusion: Incorporating alternative items and dynamic user behavior in simulators leads to improved CRS model performance and evaluation methods, benefiting how CRS systems are assessed in offline settings.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

### [296] [DR.EHR: Dense Retrieval for Electronic Health Record with Knowledge Injection and Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18583)
*Zhengyun Zhao,Huaiyuan Ying,Yue Zhong,Sheng Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents DR.EHR, dense retrieval models optimized for Electronic Health Record (EHR) retrieval, significantly advancing prior methods in addressing semantic gap challenges using a novel two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the challenge of retrieving EHRs due to semantic gap issues, where existing general-domain or biomedical-domain dense retrieval models lack adequate medical knowledge or suitable training corpora.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage training pipeline using MIMIC-IV discharge summaries. The first stage incorporates medical entity extraction and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second stage leverages large language models to generate diverse training data. It trains DR.EHR models with 110M and 7B parameters.

Result: DR.EHR models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on CliniQ benchmarks, outperforming existing dense retrieval systems across diverse query types and challenging semantic matches.

Conclusion: DR.EHR provides a robust solution to EHR retrieval challenges, excelling in semantic understanding and generalizing well to EHR QA tasks, thereby facilitating improved clinical applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

*Jaechul Roh,Zachary Novack,Yuefeng Peng,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Amir Houmansadr*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study identifies vulnerabilities in lyrics-to-song (LS2) generation models, demonstrating how phonetic perturbations in lyrics can cause models to regurgitate memorized audiovisual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the memorization vulnerabilities of Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation systems and understand implications on copyright, safety, and content provenance.

Method: The study introduces Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), employing homophonic substitutions in lyrics to test models' memorization and outputs across audio and visual domains.

Result: Models such as SUNO, YuE, and Veo 3 exhibit memorization, regenerating high-similarity audio and visual outputs linked to recognized training data, even under phonetic distortions.

Conclusion: Phonetic prompting exposes a severe vulnerability in transcript-conditioned multimodal systems, raising critical concerns about data safety and intellectual property rights in generative AI.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

### [298] [Trek-Based Parameter Identification for Linear Causal Models With Arbitrarily Structured Latent Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18170)
*Nils Sturma,Mathias Drton*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel latent-subgraph criterion for certifying causal effects' identifiability in linear structural equation models that include latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying causal effects often restrict latent variables to independent latent factors, which limits broader applicability. The authors aim to overcome these limitations.

Method: The paper proposes a graphical condition for identifiability and develops a sound and complete algorithm using integer linear programming to verify the criterion.

Result: The latent-subgraph criterion is shown to be sufficient for identifiability via rational formulas in the covariance matrix. The authors also highlight its adaptability to simpler measurement models.

Conclusion: This criterion broadens the toolkit for causal identification, adding flexibility to include latent variables, without conventional restrictions, and integrates well with other existing analytical methods.

Abstract: We develop a criterion to certify whether causal effects are identifiable in
linear structural equation models with latent variables. Linear structural
equation models correspond to directed graphs whose nodes represent the random
variables of interest and whose edges are weighted with linear coefficients
that correspond to direct causal effects. In contrast to previous
identification methods, we do not restrict ourselves to settings where the
latent variables constitute independent latent factors (i.e., to source nodes
in the graphical representation of the model). Our novel latent-subgraph
criterion is a purely graphical condition that is sufficient for
identifiability of causal effects by rational formulas in the covariance
matrix. To check the latent-subgraph criterion, we provide a sound and complete
algorithm that operates by solving an integer linear program. While it targets
effects involving observed variables, our new criterion is also useful for
identifying effects between latent variables, as it allows one to transform the
given model into a simpler measurement model for which other existing tools
become applicable.

### [299] [Zeroth-order log-concave sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18021)
*Yunbum Kook*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper investigates the zeroth-order query complexity for log-concave sampling using membership oracles. It presents a proximal sampler variant achieving improved query efficiency for generating samples with $q$-R\'enyi divergence, alongside an effective annealing scheme for warm-start initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of log-concave sampling methods, specifically for uniform sampling from convex bodies, by addressing challenges in initialization and query complexity.

Method: The authors propose a proximal sampler variant and an annealing scheme leveraging $q$-R\'enyi divergence to improve sampling initialization and convergence guarantees.

Result: The proximal sampler achieves favorable query complexity depending on $q$-R\'enyi divergence, while the annealing scheme initializes warm start effectively with reduced query overhead.

Conclusion: The approach leverages hypercontractivity and improved mixing guarantees to achieve efficient sampling under logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, with extensions to general log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles.

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

### [300] [Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17893)
*Milad Taghipour,Bane Vasic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper applies reinforcement learning to improve decoding performance for linear block codes and proposes several strategies to enhance and optimize the decoding process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to improve the performance of decoding techniques for linear block codes by leveraging reinforcement learning and addressing challenges like state complexity in Markov Decision Processes.

Method: The authors map the iterative decoding process to Markov Decision Processes, propose a truncated MDP to reduce state complexity, and introduce reinforcement-learning-based decoders (action-list decoding) using Deep-Q networks. They also employ feedback methods and utilize code automorphism groups to further enhance decoder performance.

Result: The proposed reinforcement learning-based decoding techniques demonstrated enhanced performance for Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) and successfully reduced complexity.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to improve linear block code decoding performance while reducing complexity, making the methods applicable to a broader range of coding scenarios.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

*Amirarsalan Moatazedian,Yauhen Yakimenka,Rémi A. Chou,Jörg Kliewer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper investigates a privacy-preserving framework involving data sanitization, where a privatizer ensures authorized reconstruction while minimizing unauthorized adversaries' estimation ability, with theoretical and experimental analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data privacy challenges by ensuring authorized reconstruction of sanitized data and minimizing reconstruction accuracy by unauthorized adversaries, especially under collaboration scenarios.

Method: A constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem is formulated. A training procedure alternates updates to the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries. Additionally, theoretical benchmarking is performed for Gaussian and binary data settings.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides optimal solutions for specific cases (Gaussian, binary). The minimax training approach achieves promising results in practical scenarios, balancing privacy and authorized reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances privacy in data-sharing, emphasizing collaborative reconstruction and theoretical benchmarking while maintaining reconstruction distortion thresholds.

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of AI/ML models in 5G RAN, challenges of wide-scale deployment, the standardization efforts from 3GPP Releases 16-20, and the foundation for AI-native transceivers aimed at 6G.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like model drift and vendor lock-in in AI/ML model integration in 5G RAN and prepare for the transition to AI-native transceivers essential for 6G.

Method: The paper analyzes the progression of 3GPP standards (Rel-16 to Rel-20) to design a five-block life-cycle management (LCM) architecture, standard interfaces, and mechanisms to facilitate interoperability and effective AI/ML model deployment.

Result: Standardized interfaces and monitoring mechanisms were developed for seamless AI/ML model integration across vendors, achieving greater transparency and interoperability.

Conclusion: The standardization efforts in 5G networks form a foundation for future AI-native transceivers, but challenges like environment drift detection and resource efficiency remain to be resolved for seamless 6G adoption.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

Motivation: To explore the creative potential of machines in generating meaningful mathematical conjectures and to engage both humans and AI in solving complex problems.

Method: The paper uses the automated system 'TxGraffiti' to generate conjectures based on symbolic pattern recognition, natural graph invariants, and heuristics, followed by empirical validation across many graphs.

Result: Four concise and empirically validated graph theory conjectures were presented, which remain unresolved despite human and AI efforts.

Conclusion: These conjectures serve as both mathematical challenges and a statement on the collaborative possibilities between humans and AI in the creative process of mathematical discovery.

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated
conjecturing system \texttt{TxGraffiti}. Each conjecture is concise, grounded
in natural graph invariants, and empirically validated across hundreds of
graphs. Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying
both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but
creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and
mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke
wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By
highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI
systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it
means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of
mathematical thought.

Motivation: Database systems are currently too complex for non-technical users, necessitating a solution to improve usability and reduce human errors.

automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like

strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language

purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling,
schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present
in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores using supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to predict multipactor susceptibility in RF and accelerator systems. Models like Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and multilayer perceptrons were evaluated for their accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multipactor susceptibility predictions are computationally intensive yet vital for RF and accelerator systems design. The paper aims to simplify these predictions using ML techniques.

Method: Simulation-driven datasets featuring six distinct secondary electron yield profiles were utilized. ML models like RF, ET, XGBoost, and MLPs were trained to predict electron growth rates. Various metrics assessed performance.

Result: Tree-based models performed better for generalization across various material domains, and enhancements in MLPs were achieved through specific loss function optimizations.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows promise for accelerating multipactor predictions but requires broader datasets and refinement in model design.

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in traditional polymer crystallization identification methods, which depend on single order parameters prone to sensitivity and systematic biases.

Method: The study develops a machine learning workflow that integrates geometric, thermodynamic-like, and symmetry-based descriptors. Using unsupervised clustering and supervised learning, the workflow determines the minimal order parameters required for accurate crystallinity labeling.

Result: The authors reduced feature sets to three order parameters and introduced the Crystallinity index (C-index), achieving over 0.98 AUC classification performance. The method enables real-time monitoring of polymer crystallization using machine learning.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow effectively selects optimal order parameters, reduces biases, and offers a robust data-driven strategy to monitor structural transformations during polymer crystallization stages.

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

### [307] [Rapid Modeling Architecture for Lightweight Simulator to Accelerate and Improve Decision Making for Industrial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17990)
*Takumi Kato,Zhi Li Hu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator, reducing modeling time by 78.3% while maintaining essential design details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of industrial system design decision-making in its early phases, which often suffers from inaccuracies due to limited information. Conventional simulation tools require excessive modeling time, hindering rapid decision-making.

Method: The researchers developed a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) for industrial simulation and incorporated it into a prototype simulator. The system's efficiency was tested through comparisons with traditional simulators in actual factory layout design scenarios.

Result: The RMA-based prototype reduced modeling time by 78.3% compared to conventional simulation tools, demonstrating significant time-saving benefits.

Conclusion: Rapid modeling with RMA improves industrial system design decision-making by significantly reducing modeling time while retaining critical details necessary for effective decision-making.

Abstract: Designing industrial systems, such as building, improving, and automating
distribution centers and manufacturing plants, involves critical
decision-making with limited information in the early phases. The lack of
information leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often
difficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the
designed system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time
required by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model
creation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid
Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that
mitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order
to accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based
on the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also
compared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator,
and as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time
compared to conventional simulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like GPT-4 have exhibited general capabilities in finance, but domain-specific needs such as multimodal reasoning and compliance necessitate specialized FFMs tailored for financial applications.

Method: The study categorizes FFMs into three types (FinLFMs, FinTSFMs, FinVLFMs) and reviews their architectures, training methods, datasets, and applications. It also identifies challenges and suggests directions for future research.

Result: The paper provides a structured taxonomy of FFMs, insights into their current capabilities and applications, and a list of challenges such as data availability and algorithmic scalability.

Conclusion: This survey offers a foundational understanding of FFMs, serving as both a reference for current technologies and a guide for future innovations, supported by a repository of FFM resources.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module to improve bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations in Digital Twin (DT) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized frameworks in Digital Twins (DTs) complicates the transition from academia to industry. There’s a need to address the "reality gap" between simulations and real-world operations for efficient lifecycle management.

Method: The paper integrates a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework, connecting data pipelines to components like historical repositories and simulation models. This allows for sim-to-real and real-to-sim knowledge transfer.

Result: A case study on a pedestrian bridge at Carnegie Mellon University demonstrates successful implementation. The full integration of the RGA module enables effective bidirectional knowledge transfer without compromising efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating an RGA module and data pipelines into DTs enhances their lifecycle management capability, bridging the reality gap for a smoother transition between simulations and real-world applications.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper compares GNN architectures (GCNs, GATs, GINs) applied to toxicological datasets and finds that GINs perform better in data-abundant scenarios, while GATs excel in data-scarce environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of exploration of different GNN architectures in AI-driven cheminformatics, specifically their applications in toxicological assays.

Method: The study preprocesses molecular graph data, applies class balance and stratification, then conducts Bayesian optimizations across 21 GNN-dataset combinations on toxicological assays to identify optimal architectures.

Result: Optimized GNNs attained AUC scores between 0.728-0.849; GINs outperformed others in data-abundant assays, while GATs performed better in data-scarce scenarios. Hyperparameter analysis showed that GCNs and GATs had more similar optimizations than GINs.

Conclusion: GINs are best suited to data-abundant environments, and GATs excel in data-scarce conditions, highlighting the importance of selecting the right GNN architecture based on dataset characteristics.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper presents CM-UNet, a model leveraging self-supervised pre-training to improve coronary artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, showing reduced reliance on extensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of coronary artery segmentation caused by limited annotated datasets, which hinder accurate diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease.

Method: The paper introduces CM-UNet, which utilizes self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer learning on limited annotated data to enhance segmentation performance.

Result: CM-UNet achieves better segmentation accuracy with only 18 annotated images, experiencing a 15.2% Dice score drop compared to the baseline models' 46.5% drop without pre-training.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning in CM-UNet significantly improves coronary artery segmentation accuracy, reduces annotation dependence, and has promising clinical implications for diagnosis and workflow enhancement.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

*Xinyuan Yan,Rita Sevastjanova,Sinie van der Ben,Mennatallah El-Assady,Bei Wang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The study develops a framework for semi-automatically analyzing linguistic properties in large language model (LLM) embeddings through topological structures called mapper graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the topological structures in LLM embeddings can reveal encoded linguistic properties, but manual exploration requires substantial effort.

Method: The paper creates a taxonomy for mapper graph elements (nodes, edges, etc.) and employs customizable LLM agents with perturbation techniques to automate annotations. This framework is integrated into a visual analytics tool.

Result: The framework successfully replicates findings from earlier research on BERT embeddings and discovers new linguistic properties of topological neighborhoods in embeddings.

Conclusion: Semi-automatic exploration via mapper graphs represents a scalable way to analyze LLM embeddings, enabling deeper insights into linguistic and syntactic structures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores the sequencing of personalized support in scenario-based learning (SBL) to enhance diagnostic reasoning, comparing instructions given before (I-PS) vs after (PS-I) problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Students in various domains often struggle with diagnostic reasoning due to cognitive biases, making effective strategies essential for learning.

Method: A between-groups design was implemented in PharmaSim, an online SBL environment simulating pharmacy interactions, to test instruction sequences (I-PS vs PS-I).

Result: Both approaches improve learning, but instruction provided post-problem-solving (PS-I) significantly enhances transfer task performance.

Conclusion: Personalized support in SBL is effective, and post-problem-solving instruction (PS-I) provides greater benefits for learning transfer.

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper discusses a two-stage fine-tuning process to enable scalable adaptation of automated driving for diverse environments and systems, addressing technical, legal, cultural, and ethical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated driving systems face challenges in scaling across different vehicle types, environments, traffic laws, and cultural norms, requiring flexible solutions for broad deployment.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning approach is proposed: first, adapting to environments via country-specific reward models that align technology with socio-political needs; second, employing vehicle-specific transfer learning for customization and design validation.

Result: The proposed concept integrates technological adaptation with socio-political considerations, paving the way for scalable implementation across diverse systems and environments.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a data-driven solution for efficient scalability of automated driving systems, addressing variations in technical, legal, cultural, and ethical requirements.

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

*Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This study challenges the point-source hypothesis for the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) using neural network-aided simulation methods. It finds the excess may better align with dark matter predictions or require an exceptionally high number of point sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the mysterious nature of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) detected by the Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope, which may indicate dark matter annihilation or dim point sources.

Method: The authors leveraged a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach to integrate both spatial and spectral data, overcoming prior analyses' limitations of using only spatial information.

Result: Results showed that incorporating energy data suggests the GCE is consistent with diffuse emission as expected from dark matter or would require an exceptionally high number of point sources (order of 10^5 or more), significantly more than previously estimated.

Conclusion: The analysis provides new evidence that either the GCE aligns with dark matter emission or, if due to point sources, the required population size is much larger than earlier studies suggested.

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

TL;DR: A transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding achieves low-energy consumption and adapts dynamically to per-user requirements. It performs well in zero-shot deployment with reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges of data availability and complexity in training DL-based precoding models for mMIMO systems while improving energy efficiency and flexibility.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based model focusing on energy-efficient transmitter precoding with per-user rate adaptation and introduces a data augmentation method using cosine similarity for training in data-scarce deployments.

Result: The model demonstrates superior zero-shot deployment performance compared to zero forcing, approximates weighted MMSE results with 8x less computational complexity, and enhances energy efficiency and versatility.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical framework for implementing DL-based solutions in mMIMO precoding, addressing data availability and complexity issues, while improving control over energy efficiency and fairness.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in multisensory integration research, especially concerning three or more sensory modalities, highlighting factors like cross-modal correspondence and stimulus timing.

Method: Analyzes the factors influencing MSI, such as congruence and cognitive load, and their application in designing study protocols.

Result: The paper provides insights into addressing complexity in MSI research by focusing on designing protocols that account for interactions between multiple modalities.

Conclusion: The research sheds light on the importance of considering multiple factors when studying MSI, offering guidance for studies involving three or more senses.

Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create
a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies.
Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the
interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and
characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the
integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must
account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive
load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities
multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied
to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

### [318] [Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943)
*Shu-Yuan Liu,Johan Engström,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for estimating brake onset in driving data to assess automated driving systems (ADS) performance without relying on vehicle control signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to measure response times in collision scenarios rely on manual annotation or control signals, which are impractical for large-scale data or ADS logs without vehicle signals.

Method: Developed a piecewise linear acceleration model-based algorithm for brake onset estimation, and validated it against manual annotations using naturalistic collision avoidance data.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated high accuracy with an R² confidence metric compared to manual annotations, showing strong classification performance for both ADS and human drivers.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, generalizable, and applicable to diverse road users and scenarios, though certain limitations are acknowledged.

Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated
driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not
limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver
response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human
driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and
a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual
annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal
movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data
where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for
the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding
road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques
for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are
not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a
piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that
can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal
time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake
onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence
metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification
performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both
ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.
Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,
generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly
configurable.

Motivation: To explore how different communication strategies impact collaborative problem-solving in LLM agents within AI-aided education.

Method: The study assessed four communication strategies in a dual-agent chat environment using the MATH dataset and the OpenAI GPT-4o model.

Result: Dual-agent setups outperformed single agents, with peer-to-peer collaboration yielding the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts significantly contributed to outcomes.

Conclusion: Multi-agent setups and effective communication strategies enhance problem-solving efficiency in educational AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer

acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered ambient scribe application that generates clinical SOAP notes and reduces clinician workload, demonstrating higher quality and wide adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address clinician burnout and the burden of administrative tasks by providing an AI-assisted tool to streamline documentation processes in healthcare.

Method: Developed an AI application integrated with the EHR system using Whisper for transcription, GPT-4o for SOAP note generation, and a fine-tuned BART model for enhancing conciseness.

Result: The AI-generated notes exceeded expert-written quality based on LLM evaluation, and 94% of surveyed clinicians reported reduced cognitive load and 97% reported reduced documentation burden.

Conclusion: AI systems can significantly ease documentation burdens, support clinicians, and enhance healthcare delivery quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to rethink workflows as AI evolves from automation to active creative collaboration.

Method: Human-AI co-creation via iterative cycles of proposal, critique, and revision using LLMs and diffusion models.

conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of
large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles
of proposal, critique, and revision.

*Alex Liu,Lief Esbenshade,Shawon Sarkar,Victor Tian,Zachary Zhang,Kevin He,Min Sun*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study analyzes educator-AI interactions on a generative AI platform, using a human-AI collaborative method, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs (e.g., Claude 3.5 Haiku) to enhance qualitative research and promote teacher preparedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how educators use generative AI tools to plan instruction, meet diverse learner needs, and engage in professional reflection at scale, and to address the gap in understanding such practices.

Method: The paper utilizes a human-AI collaborative methodology involving a four-phase coding pipeline: inductive theme discovery, codebook creation, annotation, and model benchmarking. It analyzes over 140,000 educator-AI messages and compares LLMs' performance in qualitative coding.

Result: The findings reveal educators primarily use AI for instructional enhancement (79.7%), content adaptation (76.1%), assessments and feedback (46.9%), tailored instruction (43.3%), and other responsibilities (34.2%). LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, reliably identify qualitative themes and excel in accuracy and structural reliability.

Conclusion: This study provides a transparent model for AI-assisted qualitative research, illustrates the potential of LLMs in supporting educator practices, and suggests implications for teacher training and professional development.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PosterMate, an AI-assisted tool that simulates audience personas for collaborative poster design feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective poster design requires diverse audience feedback, which is challenging to gather and reconcile.

Method: PosterMate utilizes AI to create persona agents from marketing documents, gathers feedback, and moderates discussions to synthesize perspectives.

Result: User studies and evaluations showed PosterMate captures overlooked viewpoints and ensures persona-driven feedback aligns with identities.

Conclusion: PosterMate has potential as a prototyping tool and facilitates collaborative design processes effectively.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable and interpretable approach to cognitive modeling, with applications in adaptive learning, HCI, and educational analytics.

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in visualizing high-dimensional data in a lossless, interpretable, and computationally efficient way while preventing occlusion issues.

Method: Proposing a framework that uses Concentric Coordinates, a generalization of Parallel Coordinates and Circular Coordinates, to visualize high-dimensional data.

Result: The framework supports lossless visualization of multi-dimensional data and enables better integration with machine learning algorithms and human interaction.

*Rameen Abdal,Or Patashnik,Ekaterina Deyneka,Hao Chen,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Sergey Tulyakov,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kfir Aberman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot framework for personalizing dynamic concepts in text-to-video generation, which eliminates the need for per-instance fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video methods require extensive per-instance fine-tuning for personalized dynamic concepts, making them less scalable.

Method: The authors propose a zero-shot approach using structured 2x2 video grids along with lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition. A Grid Fill module is integrated for ensuring coherence and identity preservation.

Result: The system achieves temporally coherent, identity-preserving results, generalizing to unseen dynamic concepts without requiring test-time optimization.

Conclusion: The framework is shown to deliver high-quality video synthesis and composition efficiently across diverse dynamic concepts and editing scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

*SeungJun Moon,Hah Min Lew,Seungeun Lee,Ji-Su Kang,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GeoAvatar introduces an adaptive Gaussian framework for 3D head avatar generation, focusing on better identity preservation and dynamic pose animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of balancing identity preservation with animation fidelity in 3D head avatar creation, as existing methods struggle with adapting Gaussian geometries across facial regions.

Method: The framework, GeoAvatar, utilizes an Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS) for unsupervised Gaussian segmentation, a novel mouth structure for dynamic animation, and a regularization loss tied to 3DMM faces.

Result: GeoAvatar demonstrates superior reconstruction and animation capabilities compared to cutting-edge methods, further supported by the introduction of a new dataset, DynamicFace.

Conclusion: The study presents GeoAvatar as a significant step forward in achieving high-quality 3D avatars that balance identity accuracy with expressive animations.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

*Zhen Han,Mattias Teye,Derek Yadgaroff,Judith Bütepage*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in high-quality, real-time facial animation using speech-driven models, focusing on on-device applications with reduced memory and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large, diverse datasets and the computationally intensive nature of existing facial animation models limit the development of robust, real-time animation systems for applications such as game development.

Method: The authors use hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. They leverage a high-performing teacher model to train smaller student models, comprising only convolutional and fully-connected layers.

Result: The resulting facial animation models achieve significant reductions in memory footprint (down to 3.4 MB) and audio context requirements (down to 81 ms) while maintaining high-quality animations.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time, on-device facial animations, making it feasible to deploy model-driven digital characters in resource-constrained environments such as gaming.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PS-GS, a method combining Gaussian Splatting and Multi-view Photometric Stereo for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D reconstruction by integrating inverse rendering with MVPS, addressing challenges in conventional methods reliant on fixed illumination.

Method: The PS-GS method initially reconstructs a 2D Gaussian splatting model, followed by deferred inverse rendering using full rendering equations and lighting-computing neural networks. It incorporates regularizations via photometric stereo normals and refines lighting through Gaussian ray-tracing.

Result: PS-GS demonstrated superior reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency in experiments on both synthetic and real datasets compared to previous works.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates the ill-posed nature of inverse rendering, making it valuable for applications like novel-view synthesis, relighting, and material/shape editing.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: To resolve discrepancies in theoretical and experimental studies of hydrogen in warm dense matter and provide accurate benchmarks for thermodynamic properties.

Method: The study employs three deep generative models (normalizing flow, autoregressive transformer, permutational equivariant flow) to minimize variational free energy, thereby modeling hydrogen nuclei and electron distributions.

Result: The method delivers precise results for the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of hydrogen, validating its findings by comparing with deuterium Hugoniot curve data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel approach to studying warm dense matter, addressing existing discrepancies and enhancing understanding of hydrogen's thermodynamic behavior.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.

Conclusion: This RL-based approach effectively navigates complex quantum state spaces and devises near-optimal circuits, presenting a scalable, resource-efficient solution for quantum circuit synthesis.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The authors propose Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. It achieves computational speedups in belief updates using quantum methods, demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate decision-making processes in partially observable environments by leveraging recent advancements in quantum computational techniques applied to reinforcement learning.

Method: The research introduces QBRL, a hybrid algorithm that employs quantum rejection sampling and amplitude amplification to perform belief updates more efficiently in model-based reinforcement learning. A detailed time complexity analysis is performed without relying on black-box assumptions, and numerical experiments are conducted to benchmark QBRL’s performance against classical methods.

Result: QBRL achieves sub-quadratic speedups in planning tasks for environments modeled as sparse Bayesian networks. Numerical experiments confirm the computational advantage, although its magnitude varies based on deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced methods offer significant potential to improve decision-making in partially observable environments, with QBRL demonstrating computational advantages under specific assumptions and settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dimensional analysis struggles with high-dimensional systems due to redundant dimensionless parameters, making it difficult to achieve meaningful physical descriptions.

Method: Hi-π leverages a hybrid physics-data-driven approach that integrates dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to automatically identify optimal, meaningful dimensionless parameters.

Result: The method successfully extracted intrinsic parameters like Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in Rayleigh-Bénard convection, Reynolds number and relative roughness in viscous pipe flow, and compressibility correction formulation in subsonic flow, showcasing its accuracy and flexibility.

Conclusion: Hi-π provides a robust and automated approach for simplifying high-dimensional physical systems by identifying key dimensionless parameters, with potential applications across various fields.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes advancements for LPWAN technology SNOW by enabling higher scalability using unique coding sequences, achieving 9x more scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the scalability problem in LPWANs to efficiently handle numerous sensors with low latency for emerging IoT and CPS applications.

Method: The authors utilize Gold code-based PN sequences to allow simultaneous data encoding and decoding by numerous asynchronous sensors on the same and across multiple subcarriers.

Result: The approach demonstrated approximately 9x improved scalability in SNOW, ensuring timeliness in data collection and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: This enhanced method in SNOW can support tens of thousands of sensors with extended battery life and enable IoT and CPS applications requiring rapid, data-driven decisions.

Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over
large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to
achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data
efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may
require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly
advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel
reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a
different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by
enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on
the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.
Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data
from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data
parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold
code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering
within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the
set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive
concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve
approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection
at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and
CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery
life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.

### [342] [From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18229)
*Zeqiang Zhang,Ruxin Chen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning (RL) deviates from equilibrium theory in economic models, promoting manipulative behaviors. To resolve this, a Mean-Field RL framework aligns agent behavior with competitive equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile discrepancies between agent behavior learned via RL and economic equilibrium theory in computational social science, and address biases in RL simulations for economic systems.

Method: The authors propose a calibrated Mean-Field RL framework with a representative agent embedded in a macroeconomic field, adjusting intertemporal costs, and iteratively converging to a fixed point with competitive equilibrium.

Result: The framework demonstrated convergence to a self-consistent fixed point where agent behavior matched competitive equilibrium policies, resolving biases inherent in traditional RL methods.

Conclusion: The calibrated Mean-Field RL serves as a theoretically sound and computationally practical tool for modeling learning agents in economic systems, aligning RL outcomes with equilibrium predictions.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how emerging technologies are discussed by influential social media figures to manage uncertainty and shape societal perceptions.

Method: The study uses text mining, BERTopic modeling, and emotion/sentiment analyses on posts from 400 prominent figures between 2021-2023.

Result: The research identifies 100 topics with optimistic themes like AI and IoT dominating, while some topics still elicit anxiety. It highlights KOLs' role in bridging societal challenges and technology-mediated futures.

Conclusion: Key opinion leaders influence public perceptions by framing emerging technologies either positively or anxiously, thus playing a crucial role in shaping societal narratives and debates.

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

TL;DR: This study investigates the robustness of biomedical foundation models (FMs) to non-biological technical features and introduces PathoROB for evaluation and improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks posed by biomedical FMs learning non-biological technical features, which could lead to clinical errors and hinder safe adoption.

Method: Developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with novel metrics and diverse datasets, to evaluate the robustness of FMs across 28 biological classes and multiple medical centers.

Result: Identified robustness deficits in all 20 evaluated FMs, revealing diagnostic errors caused by non-robust representations. Demonstrated partial improvements using more robust FMs and post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluation is crucial for safe clinical adoption of pathology FMs. Future FM development should prioritize robustness as a key design principle, with PathoROB serving as a framework for progress.

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of efficient approaches for parameter-efficient representations in 3D convolution operations, especially in fine-tuning DDPMs for MRI image generation.

Method: The proposed method, TenVOO, leverages tensor network modeling to represent 3D convolution kernels using lower-dimensional tensors, reducing the number of trainable parameters while preserving spatial dependencies during fine-tuning.

Result: TenVOO was evaluated on three brain MRI datasets (ADNI, PPMI, BraTS2021) using a DDPM pretrained on UK Biobank MRI scans. It outperformed existing methods in MS-SSIM and required only 0.3% of the original model's trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TenVOO is a highly efficient and accurate PEFT method for fine-tuning DDPMs in MRI generation, showcasing its potential in capturing spatial dependencies with minimal parameters.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural

Conclusion: While the model exhibited strengths in specificity and competition ranking, further improvement is needed for better overall predictive performance on glioblastoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,

TL;DR: The study developed Machine Learning models using hyperspectral imaging to predict nitrogen concentrations in grapevine leaves and canopies for better vineyard management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage nitrogen fertilization efficiently in vineyards by accurately estimating nitrogen concentration at both leaf and canopy levels due to soil nitrogen's variability.

Method: Hyperspectral imaging from wavelengths 400-1000nm was used with feature selection techniques and two ML models—Gradient Boosting and XGBoost—to predict nitrogen concentrations.

Result: R square values of 0.49 (canopy-level) and 0.57 (leaf-level) were achieved, indicating reasonable prediction accuracy using specific spectral bands.

Conclusion: The study showcased the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating hyperspectral imaging and ML methods for precise nitrogen monitoring in vineyards.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

Motivation: To address the limitations of time-consuming and suboptimal solutions in reconstructing atomic crystal structures using current MEP algorithms.

Method: MEP-Diffusion was developed as a diffusion model trained on a large crystal structure database and integrated into reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS).

Result: The approach resulted in a 90.50% improvement in SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrating MEP-Diffusion as a generative prior into MEP reconstruction methods significantly advances the quality and efficiency of atomic crystal structure imaging.

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

### [351] [Hierarchical Diffusion Framework for Pseudo-Healthy Brain MRI Inpainting with Enhanced 3D Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17911)
*Dou Hoon Kwark,Shirui Luo,Xiyue Zhu,Yudu Li,Zhi-Pei Liang,Volodymyr Kindratenko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical diffusion framework for pseudo-healthy brain MRI inpainting that improves realism and volumetric consistency using combined perpendicular 2D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current pseudo-healthy brain MRI inpainting methods that suffer from slice-wise discontinuities in 2D models or require extensive training data in fully 3D models.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage hierarchical diffusion framework: an axial model for coarse results and a coronal model for refining anatomical details, combined via adaptive resampling to ensure volumetric consistency and data efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both realism and volumetric consistency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a data-efficient and effective solution for volumetric consistent pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting, advancing the field with freely available code for broader use.

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

*Deepa Krishnaswamy,Cosmin Ciausu,Steve Pieper,Ron Kikinis,Benjamin Billot,Andrey Fedorov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks three existing abdominal MRI segmentation models alongside a new model, ABDSynth, which uses CT segmentation data to circumvent annotation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI segmentation faces challenges like signal variability and high annotation costs, unlike CT segmentation. The authors aim to address the lack of generalizable MRI models.

Method: The paper evaluates three state-of-the-art segmentation models and introduces ABDSynth, trained on CT segmentations. Testing is done on diverse datasets not used during training.

Result: MRSegmentator emerges as the top-performing model, showing superior accuracy and generalizability. ABDSynth, while slightly less accurate, requires less annotation effort, offering an alternative for resource-constrained setups.

Conclusion: MRSegmentator is recommended for accuracy and generalizability, whereas ABDSynth is a suitable option for limited budgets. Resources for benchmarking and model evaluation are publicly provided.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights
for ABDSynth.

*Hang Xu,Alexandre Bousse,Alessandro Perelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEcomp-MoD, a deep learning method for directly converting DECT projection data into material images, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current material decomposition methods in DECT primarily operate in the image domain as a post-processing step, leading to sub-optimal results due to the beam-hardening effect.

Method: The DEcomp-MoD method combines a spectral DECT model-based training loss with score-based denoising diffusion learned priors, directly processing sinogram data into material images using a model-based conditional diffusion process.

Result: Experiments on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance of DEcomp-MoD compared to unsupervised score-based models and supervised deep learning networks.

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD holds promise for clinical deployment, offering enhanced material decomposition directly from DECT projection data with improved accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

*Yilong Hu,Shijie Chang,Lihe Zhang,Feng Tian,Weibing Sun,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UniSegDiff improves lesion segmentation performance across various modalities and organs using a tailored framework for diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) are promising for lesion segmentation but face challenges in uneven attention distribution across timesteps, leading to less efficient training and inference.

Method: A staged training and inference strategy that dynamically adjusts prediction targets, combined with pre-training a feature extraction network, focusing on attention distribution across all diffusion timesteps.

Result: UniSegDiff significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in lesion segmentation across six organs and multiple imaging modalities.

Conclusion: This novel framework not only tackles inefficiencies in DPMs but also broadens the scope of unified lesion segmentation, setting new benchmarks for performance.

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: The paper proposes a solution to enhance multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology image diagnosis through a specialized dataset, a prompt argumentation strategy, and advanced training methods, resulting in significantly improved diagnostic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from existing challenges in gastrointestinal pathology with multimodal models, including noisy data, incomplete annotations, potential factual hallucinations, and lack of intermediate reasoning chains, leading to reduced trustworthiness in clinical settings.

Method: The authors created a large gastrointestinal pathology dataset with microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, developed a prompt argumentation strategy incorporating lesion classification and anatomical site information, and employed a post-training pipeline with supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The approach led to a substantial improvement in pathology report generation metrics, with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% better structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the proposed multimodal model and strategy improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical relevance, and reliability, establishing a strong advancement over previous approaches for gastrointestinal pathology analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the microclustering Ewens-Pitman model, optimizing it for random partitions with sub-linear clustering and linear cluster growth, and applies it for faster and effective Bayesian inference in entity resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in random partition models, particularly in entity resolution tasks, by introducing a model that balances computational efficiency and performance.

Method: They scale the strength parameter of the Ewens-Pitman model linearly with sample size and connect it with the Pitman-Yor process. They then develop efficient variational inference schemes to improve posterior computations.

Result: The proposed approach delivers a computational speed-up of three orders of magnitude compared to existing Bayesian entity resolution methods while performing competitively in terms of empirical results.

Conclusion: The microclustering Ewens-Pitman model successfully incorporates the microclustering property for balanced growth and efficiency, offering a significant advancement for practical entity resolution tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the microclustering Ewens--Pitman model for random partitions,
obtained by scaling the strength parameter of the Ewens--Pitman model linearly
with the sample size. The resulting random partition is shown to have the
microclustering property, namely: the size of the largest cluster grows
sub-linearly with the sample size, while the number of clusters grows linearly.
By leveraging the interplay between the Ewens--Pitman random partition with the
Pitman--Yor process, we develop efficient variational inference schemes for
posterior computation in entity resolution. Our approach achieves a speed-up of
three orders of magnitude over existing Bayesian methods for entity resolution,
while maintaining competitive empirical performance.

Conclusion: Using modern C++ constructs with appropriate runtime environments enhances HPC applications like OpenFOAM for both multi-core CPUs and GPUs while maintaining a unified codebase.

Abstract: The modern trend in High-Performance Computing (HPC) involves the use of

TL;DR: This paper introduces a nonconvex optimization framework for designing group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic problems, addressing scalability and sparsity challenges in large-scale systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and structure-aware control in large-scale linear-quadratic systems, extending classical frameworks to cover complex sparsity patterns.

Method: The framework uses nonconvex optimization with group l0-norm regularization and introduces a penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm with convergence guarantees.

Result: The framework supports distributed and sparse feedback LQ problems under a single approach, ensuring efficient solver design, theoretical guarantees, and global convergence to critical points.

Conclusion: This method overcomes the limitations of convex relaxations and restrictive assumptions, advancing direct controller synthesis in large-scale system design.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for optimized resource provisioning for 5G core functions to ensure SLA compliance and tackle challenges like DDoS attacks.

Method: The study includes analyses of chaotic workloads on user equipment registration, evaluation of resource profiling requirements, and the use of kernel-based monitoring to enhance security.

Result: The evaluation showed the necessity of diverse resource profiles and potential benefits of kernel-based monitoring for addressing security threats in large-scale 5G deployments.

Conclusion: Efficient resource provisioning and scalable monitoring are crucial for deploying 5G core network functions in complex, large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study discusses Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) through visual inputs, proposing the RECALLED approach. This includes pixel-level optimization and techniques for generating universal attack templates, leading to increased system resource usage and exposing vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCAs represent a critical security challenge for LVLMs, especially with their growing reliance on multimodal data, including visual inputs. Current studies overlook visual attack vectors, leaving LVLMs susceptible.

Method: The paper introduces RECALLED, using Vision Guided Optimization for adversarial visual input perturbations and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses for universal attack templates. These methods allow indefinite output generation and enhance RCA effectiveness.

Result: RECALLED was shown to raise service response latency by over 26%, increasing GPU utilization and memory consumption by 20%, exposing LVLM vulnerabilities to visual-input RCAs.

Conclusion: The findings call for urgent defense mechanisms against visual-input RCAs in LVLMs, providing a red-teaming framework for future security advancements.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the vulnerability of LoRA-based fine-tuned language models to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) and proposes a comprehensive framework, LoRA-Leak, for assessing privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA fine-tuned models are widely used, but their susceptibility to privacy attacks like MIAs has been understudied despite the reliance on pre-trained model information.

Method: The authors introduced LoRA-Leak, which integrates 15 MIAs (10 existing ones and 5 improved versions leveraging pre-trained models as reference) to evaluate privacy risks in various fine-tuning settings.

Result: LoRA-Leak reveals that LoRA-based fine-tuning remains vulnerable to MIAs, achieving 0.775 AUC in conservative settings. Dropout and excluding certain LM layers during fine-tuning effectively reduce privacy risks without major utility loss.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models exacerbate privacy issues under the fine-tuning paradigm, and adopting targeted defenses can help mitigate risks and protect data privacy for LM providers.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Result: LLMs improve detection accuracy and reduce false alarms in security systems but face issues in transparency, interpretability, and adaptability.

Conclusion: Further optimization of LLMs' structure and generalization ability is needed to build more intelligent and accurate information security systems.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive, often modifying model structures or parameters, which raises concerns about cost and behavioral shifts, limiting adoption and the practicality of watermarking solutions.

Method: The authors introduce NWaaS, a concept for nonintrusive watermarking focusing on X-to-Image models, and implement ShadowMark using a side channel approach with a key encoder and watermark decoder.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ShadowMark's robustness and applicability across diverse DNN architectures and tasks, effectively upholding fidelity and resisting attacks without compromising performance.

Conclusion: ShadowMark offers a practical and effective solution for DNN intellectual property protection, facilitating nonintrusive watermarking in real-world scenarios without the trade-offs of traditional methods.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.
