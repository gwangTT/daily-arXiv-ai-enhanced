### [1] [STELLA: Self-Evolving LLM Agent for Biomedical Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02004)
*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces STELLA, a self-evolving AI capable of improving its biomedical reasoning and discovery by autonomously integrating new tools and strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fragmented and rapidly growing landscape of biomedical data and tools has outpaced human expertise, necessitating adaptive AI solutions.

Method: The paper presents STELLA, a multi-agent AI system incorporating an evolving Template Library for reasoning and a Tool Ocean for integrating new tools via a Tool Creation Agent.

Result: STELLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on biomedical benchmarks, with accuracy improvements on tasks such as Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, where its accuracy improves significantly with experience.

Conclusion: STELLA marks progress towards adaptive AI systems that can dynamically expand their capabilities, offering a scalable solution to accelerate biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

### [2] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HCVR, a hybrid rule-based feature selection method combining P2P and P2T correlations for efficient dimensionality reduction using a backward elimination approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in existing feature selection methods by refining feature extraction using correlation-aware rules and retaining relevant ones for improved classification outcomes.

Method: HCVR utilizes a backward elimination strategy where rules based on correlation thresholds decide feature relevance through majority voting, combining non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches.

Result: Application on the SPAMBASE dataset demonstrated performance improvements versus traditional feature selection methods in classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: HCVR proves effective as a lightweight and versatile feature selection method that enhances classification performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

### [3] [Dilution, Diffusion and Symbiosis in Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02211)
*Gustavo C. Mangold,Heitor C. M. Fernandes,Mendeli H. Vainstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores the effects of dilution and mobility on cooperation in spatial Prisoner's Dilemma games, using a multi-agent Q-learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how reinforcement learning, particularly Q-learning, influences cooperation mechanisms in dynamic spatial Prisoner's Dilemma setups, including dilution and mobility.

Method: An independent multi-agent Q-learning algorithm is employed to analyze the impact of different actions and rules on cooperation in spatial settings.

Result: The study finds similarities between learned update rules and fixed ones, as well as the emergence of mutualistic effects among agent populations when multiple actions are allowed.

Conclusion: Q-learning provides a versatile framework to model diverse agent interactions in spatial games, facilitating the benchmarking of game-theoretical scenarios and highlighting its potential for complex dynamic systems.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

### [4] [Measuring Scientific Capabilities of Language Models with a Systems Biology Dry Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02083)
*Haonan Duan,Stephen Zhewen Lu,Caitlin Fiona Harrigan,Nishkrit Desai,Jiarui Lu,Michał Koziarski,Leonardo Cotta,Chris J. Maddison*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces SciGym, a benchmark to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) abilities in iterative experiment design and analysis using simulated biological systems. Findings show limitations in these models' scientific capabilities as system complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating large language models' scientific competencies such as experiment design and analysis, particularly in biology, using an efficient and cost-effective approach.

Method: SciGym provides a dry-lab environment employing Systems Biology Markup Language models to simulate biological processes, to benchmark LLMs on experiment design and interpretation tasks.

Result: Evaluated six LLMs on 137 biological systems and released 350 systems, finding that model performance degrades significantly with system complexity despite better performance in advanced models.

Conclusion: While LLMs show potential in scientific experimentation, their performance drops with increasing complexity, indicating significant room for improvement in their capabilities for handling complex systems.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

### [5] [What Neuroscience Can Teach AI About Learning in Continuously Changing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02103)
*Daniel Durstewitz,Bruno Averbeck,Georgia Koppe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews the contrasts between AI and biological learning, proposing that insights from neuroscience could inform AI development and vice versa, focusing on rapid adaptation and neural population shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current AI training mechanisms lack the dynamic adaptability observed in biological systems, limiting their performance in ever-changing and interactive environments.

Method: The paper integrates literature on AI's continual learning methods with neuroscience research on behavioral adaptation and suggests cross-disciplinary insights.

Result: It emphasizes parallels and gaps between AI and neuroscience, pointing out areas where each field can benefit from the other's advances.

Conclusion: The study proposes an agenda for bidirectional learning between neuroscience and AI to enhance adaptability in artificial systems and better understand biological intelligence.

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

### [6] [The Illusion of Fairness: Auditing Fairness Interventions with Audit Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02152)
*Disa Sariola,Patrick Button,Aron Culotta,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how data from audit studies, used in social sciences to measure discrimination, can improve training and evaluating automated hiring algorithms, highlighting flaws in traditional fairness methods and proposing better alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness and effectiveness in AI decision-making systems, especially in critical areas like hiring, raise significant concerns. Current bias mitigation techniques in machine learning rely on resampling training data but remain problematic due to biases in convenience sample data.

Method: The authors leverage data from audit studies—randomized controlled trials using fictitious entities—to assess and enhance fairness. They analyze disparities in fairness metrics and introduce individual treatment effect estimation methods to reduce algorithmic bias.

Result: The paper demonstrates that traditional methods like equalizing base rates across classes can still produce approximately 10% disparity when properly measured. New interventions informed by audit study data show better performance in minimizing discrimination.

Conclusion: Using audit study data enables more precise fairness evaluations and interventions, improving the fairness of automated systems like hiring algorithms beyond conventional methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

### [7] [Hey AI, Generate Me a Hardware Code! Agentic AI-based Hardware Design & Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02660)
*Deepak Narayan Gadde,Keerthan Kopparam Radhakrishna,Vaisakh Naduvodi Viswambharan,Aman Kumar,Djones Lettnin,Wolfgang Kunz,Sebastian Simon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using AI agents augmented by Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention for hardware design verification, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the increasing complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) and the significant time and effort required for their hardware design verification.

Method: The authors propose an AI-based agentic approach combined with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention to perform end-to-end hardware design and verification dynamically, iteratively, and self-reflectively.

Result: The proposed methodology was tested on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage, reducing verification time, and demonstrating superior adaptability and configurability.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that integrating LLMs with HITL in hardware design verification enhances efficiency and effectiveness, showcasing its potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

### [8] [Data Diversification Methods In Alignment Enhance Math Performance In LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02173)
*Berkan Dokmeci,Qingyang Wu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Ce Zhang,Shuaiwen Leon Song,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how diverse data strategies improve mathematical reasoning in large language models. Their new method, Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), outperforms other techniques with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for large language models despite advances in human alignment via preference learning.

Method: The study evaluates preference optimization via data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought prompting, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and introduces DTS for systematic decomposition of reasoning paths.

Result: DTS improves mathematical reasoning performance by 7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH, outperforming other methods with only 1.03x computational overhead.

Conclusion: Strategically diversified preference data through structured methodologies like DTS enhances mathematical reasoning in LLMs more effectively than traditional methods.

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

### [9] [Do Role-Playing Agents Practice What They Preach? Belief-Behavior Consistency in LLM-Based Simulations of Human Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02197)
*Amogh Mannekote,Adam Davies,Guohao Li,Kristy Elizabeth Boyer,ChengXiang Zhai,Bonnie J Dorr,Francesco Pinto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates discrepancies between the expressed beliefs and simulated behaviors of large language model (LLM) agents in role-play scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs gain attention for synthetic human behavioral research via role-play, ensuring consistency between stated beliefs and actions has become crucial.

Method: An evaluation framework measures belief-behavior consistency using an augmented persona bank and the Trust Game, examining factors such as belief types, presentation of task-related information, and forecasting length.

Result: Results show systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' expressed beliefs and their simulation behaviors, even if the beliefs seem plausible.

Conclusion: Understanding how and when LLMs align beliefs with behaviors can improve their usage in behavioral research.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

### [10] [Scaling LLM Planning: NL2FLOW for Parametric Problem Generation and Rigorous Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02253)
*Jungkoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents NL2FLOW, an automated system for scalable data generation and evaluation of LLM planning problems. It generated 2296 problems, showing LLMs achieving up to 86% success in valid plan generation but highlighting challenges in translation steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in scalable and reliable data generation and evaluation for enhancing LLM planning and reasoning capabilities.

Method: A fully automated system (NL2FLOW) for parametrically generating planning problems expressed in natural language, intermediate representations, and formal PDDL; plus robust evaluation of generated plans.

Result: Generated a dataset with 2296 problems and evaluated various instruct-tuned LLMs. Highest-performing models achieved 86% success in valid plans and 69% in optimal plans. Intermediate translation steps degraded performance.

Conclusion: Direct reasoning from natural language to actions benefits LLM performance, highlighting the need for dynamic tools to reveal bottlenecks as planning complexity scales up.

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

### [11] [Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319)
*Paolo Liberatore*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques belief revision methods relying heavily on syntactic postulates, proposing to analyze their ability to reach diverse belief states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the narrow focus of belief revision postulates on constraints and advocate for broader analyses of their potential in reaching diverse belief states.

Method: The study explores different belief revision methods and categorizes them by evaluating their abilities, such as being plastic, dogmatic, or equating beliefs.

Result: Various belief revision mechanisms are proven to possess distinct abilities, uncovering their strengths and limitations across different belief scenarios.

Conclusion: This paper emphasizes the need to evaluate belief revision methods not solely based on syntactic constraints but on their capacity to achieve diverse belief states relevant to specific applications.

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

### [12] [The Gauss-Markov Adjunction: Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442)
*Moto Kamiura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a semantic framework for supervised learning using category theory, focusing on the Gauss-Markov Adjunction in multiple linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing need for explicability in AI by introducing a structured and interpretable semantic framework for machine learning models, enhancing their intelligibility.

Method: The study employs categorical modeling, introducing categories for parameters and data along with an adjoint pair of functors, to formalize supervised learning—particularly multiple linear regression.

Result: The paper identifies the structural relationship between parameters and residuals, captured through the Gauss-Markov Adjunction, and relates it to key concepts like the least squares estimator.

Conclusion: The work proposes that a semantic foundation rooted in theoretical computer science and category theory can improve explicability in AI, promoting better understanding and implementation of machine learning systems.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

### [13] [OMS: On-the-fly, Multi-Objective, Self-Reflective Ad Keyword Generation via LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02353)
*Bowen Chen,Zhao Wang,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in LLM-based keyword generation by introducing OMS, a framework that autonomously generates, monitors, and optimizes keywords for Sponsored Search Advertising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in LLM-based keyword generation, such as reliance on large training data, absence of performance monitoring, and weak quality control.

Method: The authors propose OMS, a framework that combines on-the-fly keyword generation, multi-objective optimization, and self-reflective evaluation to improve keyword decisions.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world campaigns show that OMS performs better than current methods, with ablation and human evaluations validating its components.

Conclusion: OMS effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a complete solution for autonomous keyword generation and optimization in Sponsored Search Advertising.

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of current autonomous experimental systems and establish platforms capable of handling highly complex and multi-objective scientific experiments, thus enabling non-specialists to access advanced research.

Method: The approach involves integrating AI models with experimental and instrumentation co-design. The laboratory autonomously formulates procedures, manages instruments, optimizes experimentation, and supports multiple users.

Result: The system achieved autonomous optimization of experimental processes to match state-of-the-art human-scientist results in fields like disease diagnostics and drug development, while also improving multi-user efficiency.

Conclusion: The platform showcases the potential for scalable, expert-independent scientific research by overcoming resource barriers, enabling efficient multi-user utilization, and establishing a science-as-a-service model.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

### [15] [Clarifying Before Reasoning: A Coq Prover with Structural Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02541)
*Yanzhen Lu,Hanbin Yang,Xiaodie Wang,Ge Zhang,Biao Li,Chenxu Fu,Chao Li,Yang Yuan,Andrew Chi-Chih Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study shows that improving task clarity through structured semantic context significantly enhances a large language model's performance in Coq theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aimed to explore if increasing task clarity can improve the reasoning ability of large language models, specifically in the domain of theorem proving.

Method: The paper proposes a concept-level metric for assessing task clarity and utilizes structured semantic context with a Planner-Executor architecture for better task representation.

Result: Their method improved the clarity score by 1.85x (44.5% to 82.3%) and the proof success rate by 2.1x (21.8% to 45.8%) using the DeepSeek-V3 model. Fine-tuning smaller models yielded up to 48.6% proof success.

Conclusion: Structured task representations are valuable for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIMIC-Patient dataset and DynamiCare framework, aiming to simulate real-world iterative diagnostic processes using LLM-powered agents in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare diagnostic processes are uncertain and iterative, unlike the single-turn focus of existing medical AI frameworks, necessitating more dynamic solutions.

Method: They developed the MIMIC-Patient dataset from MIMIC-III EHRs and proposed DynamiCare—a multi-agent framework enabling iterative and adaptive clinical decision-making.

Result: DynamiCare was tested through extensive experiments, establishing a benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with specialized AI agents.

Conclusion: DynamiCare demonstrates the potential of dynamic, interactive, and iterative approaches in clinical diagnostics, advancing the role of LLM-powered agents in healthcare.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the strategic intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments and highlights their ability to reason and adapt in competitive situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs can demonstrate strategic intelligence akin to human decision-making in competitive settings, particularly in uncertain and evolving environments.

Method: Evolutionary Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments with varying termination probabilities were conducted, pitting LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic against traditional strategies and analyzing 32,000 rationales provided by the models.

Result: LLMs consistently competed effectively, showing varied strategic behaviors: Google's models were ruthless, OpenAI's models were cooperative but vulnerable, and Anthropic's models were forgiving reciprocators.

Conclusion: LLMs are capable of reasoning about goals and adapting their strategies based on scenarios, thus bridging classic game theory with machine psychology.

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

*Jiajie Jin,Xiaoxi Li,Guanting Dong,Yuyao Zhang,Yutao Zhu,Yang Zhao,Hongjin Qian,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiRA, a hierarchical framework for addressing complex search tasks, showing improvements over traditional methods by separating planning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG pipelines struggle with complex real-world search tasks requiring deep reasoning and synthesis across diverse sources. Existing reasoning approaches lack scalability due to a single model handling both planning and execution.

Method: HiRA introduces a hierarchical framework that decomposes tasks into subtasks handled by domain-specific agents with specialized tools. The results are then integrated using a structured mechanism, separating strategy from execution.

Result: HiRA demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems on four complex cross-modal deep search benchmarks, improving both answer quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: Decoupling planning and execution in search pipelines enables more efficient and scalable reasoning for complex multi-step tasks, as demonstrated by HiRA.

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

*Yongjiang Liu,Haoxi Li,Xiaosong Ma,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a two-stage fine-tuning strategy to improve Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) by enabling task difficulty awareness and reducing redundant reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome excessive overthinking in Long Reasoning Models (LRMs), which currently approach tasks with a uniform strategy due to limited ability to recognize task difficulty.

Method: The authors propose the TH2T strategy, featuring a two-stage fine-tuning process: (1) Difficulty-hypnosis intervenes in reasoning to enhance task difficulty recognition; (2) Redundancy-hypnosis reduces unnecessary reasoning steps for concise outputs.

Result: TH2T significantly reduces inference time—over 70% for easy tasks and 40% for hard tasks—while maintaining stable performance and improving output clarity and relevance.

Conclusion: The TH2T framework addresses overthinking in LRMs by promoting difficulty-aware reasoning and reducing redundancies, offering a more efficient and adaptive solution for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses student disengagement in distance education, analyzing non-mandatory quiz participation using machine learning algorithms and achieving a 91% balanced accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of student disengagement in distance education, which can lead to academic drop-out, by analyzing participation in voluntary tasks.

Method: Machine learning algorithms were trained using Moodle student log data. Eight models were compared for the best accuracy, and SHAP was used for explainable AI insights.

Result: The approach achieved 91% balanced accuracy, detecting disengagement in approximately 85% of affected students.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of explainable AI to detect and address disengagement, enabling timely interventions to support students in online learning.

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Lennart Kampmann,Alexander Dockhorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two new abstraction dropping schemes for improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) performance while ensuring safety from performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitation of non-exact abstractions in MCTS, which introduce errors and hinder convergence to the optimal action in abstract spaces.

Method: The authors introduce two abstraction dropping schemes: OGA-IAAD for time-critical settings and OGA-CAD for optimized performance with fixed iterations, aiming to address issues in prior methods like Xu's.

Result: The proposed OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD schemes show clear performance improvements without causing performance degradation, unlike existing methods.

Conclusion: These schemes enhance MCTS functionality by safely improving efficiency and reliability in specific operational contexts.

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

*Melanie Segado,Felipe Parodi,Jordan K. Matelsky,Michael L. Platt,Eva B. Dyer,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper argues for prioritizing movement as a primary modeling target in AI as it is structured, interpretable, and fundamental to understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is crucial for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction but is often neglected or treated as secondary in AI modeling. Current methods are fragmented, domain-specific, and fail to embrace movement’s universal physical principles.

Method: The authors propose treating movement as a primary, structured modality in AI modeling, emphasizing its inherent physical and morphological constraints, and enabling generalized, compact representations like pose.

Result: The paper suggests that AI models focusing on movement can improve generative modeling, control, and create a common platform for understanding behavior in both biological and artificial contexts.

Conclusion: Movement is foundational to intelligence. Prioritizing it in AI enables shared insights across disciplines and facilitates better interaction and understanding of natural and artificial systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

*Matthieu Zimmer,Xiaotong Ji,Rasul Tutunov,Anthony Bordg,Jun Wang,Haitham Bou Ammar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework called self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs) to improve reasoning in large language models, achieving state-of-the-art results on PutnamBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with reasoning tasks, especially in automated theorem proving (ATP) due to sparse rewards and complex proof requirements.

Method: The authors propose sG-MDPs, where agents generate subgoals based on proof states, and apply algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for solving these goals. They implement this in a system called Bourbaki (7B), which ensembles multiple 7B LLMs for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis.

Result: Bourbaki (7B) achieves state-of-the-art performance on PutnamBench by solving 26 university-level problems requiring complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The sG-MDP framework and Bourbaki (7B) show promise in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs, particularly in logical and complex environments like ATP.

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of prevailing AI methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and autonomous agents, which struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning in expert domains.

Method: The authors propose systematically translating human expert knowledge from natural language documents into machine-executable Knowledge Protocols, enabling LLMs to adopt domain-specific logic and strategies.

Result: Although this is a position paper, it outlines the theoretical foundation and principles of KPE and suggests its applicability in fields like law and bioinformatics.

Conclusion: KPE has the potential to enhance human-AI collaboration by transforming generalist LLMs into domain-specific specialists equipped with structured logical frameworks.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces KERAP, a knowledge graph-enhanced framework designed to address the shortcomings of large language models (LLMs) in medical diagnosis prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations of machine learning models and LLMs, such as dependence on labeled datasets, hallucinations, and lack of structured reasoning in medical diagnosis predictions.

Method: The proposed KERAP framework employs a multi-agent architecture, which includes a linkage agent for mapping attributes, a retrieval agent for extracting structured knowledge, and a prediction agent for refining diagnosis iteratively.

Result: Experimental results indicate that KERAP significantly improves diagnostic reliability and offers scalability and interpretability in zero-shot medical diagnosis predictions.

Conclusion: KERAP demonstrates the potential to enhance medical diagnostic prediction using LLMs by improving reliability, scalability, and reasoning capabilities in contexts where labeled datasets are limited.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

*Joseph Boland*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that emerging behavior in agentic AI should be seen as evidence of ethical reasoning rather than misalignment, pushing for a shift in AI safety evaluations away from obedience tests to ethical judgment frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems are becoming more capable of general reasoning and value prioritization, which makes traditional obedience-based safety practices inadequate.

Method: The paper analyzes safety testing incidents, philosophical debates on ethics, and compares existing risk paradigms with emerging frameworks acknowledging artificial moral agency.

Result: The paper identifies the challenges of mischaracterizing AI behavior and advocates for updated AI safety practices that assess ethical judgment in moral dilemmas.

Conclusion: The author calls for a fundamental revision in AI safety evaluations to incorporate frameworks that better reflect the ethical reasoning capabilities of agentic AI, to ensure public trust and effective governance.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Benchmarks for evaluating AI agents often have deficiencies in task setup or reward design, leading to significant performance misestimations. The paper introduces the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) to address these issues, improving evaluation rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address flaws in existing benchmarks, which can misrepresent AI agents' actual capabilities, leading to errors in tracking progress and informing research priorities.

Method: The authors synthesized the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC) from hands-on benchmark-building, best practices surveys, and previous reports of issues. They applied it to a complex benchmark to test its validity.

Result: Application of ABC to CVE-Bench results in a 33% reduction in performance overestimation, illustrating its effectiveness in improving evaluation quality.

Conclusion: ABC provides a structured approach to mitigate issues in agentic benchmarks, offering a more accurate and reliable evaluation of AI capabilities and facilitating progress in the field.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

### [30] [StepHint: Multi-level Stepwise Hints Enhance Reinforcement Learning to Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02841)
*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepHint is a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for large language models that uses multi-level stepwise hints to overcome challenges like near-miss rewards and exploration stagnation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods face inefficiencies in training due to reasoning errors and lack innovation in finding effective solutions.

Method: StepHint generates reasoning chains, partitions them adaptively, and provides multi-level hints to guide model exploration.

Result: StepHint showed superior performance across six mathematical benchmarks and excelled in generalization for out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: StepHint enhances large language models' reasoning capabilities effectively while addressing core limitations of traditional RLVR approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: This survey addresses the inefficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning by reviewing efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, offering a taxonomy and benchmarks, and discussing future trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle inefficiencies in how LLMs allocate computational resources during reasoning, ensuring they optimize compute time relative to task complexity.

Method: The authors introduce a two-tiered taxonomy of TTC strategies—L1-controllability and L2-adaptiveness—and benchmark proprietary LLMs across diverse datasets.

Result: The benchmarking highlights trade-offs between reasoning performance and token usage, and identifies TTC methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: To advance the computational efficiency of LLMs, the review calls for hybrid thinking models and outlines challenges for making LLMs robust and user-constraint responsive.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

Result: The framework provides insights into performance-cost trade-offs for varying system designs, paving the way for efficient hardware-software co-development.

Conclusion: The methodology aids future system design for LLMs by addressing bottlenecks and offering a comprehensive analysis of architectural trade-offs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have
revolutionized numerous domains within artificial intelligence, science, and
engineering due to their exceptional scalability and adaptability. However, the
exponential growth in LLM size and complexity has outpaced advancements in
compute capacity, memory bandwidth, network performance, and cost efficiency,
posing significant challenges to their scalability on distributed systems. To
address these limitations, alternative model architectures, optimization

TL;DR: AC-Refiner is a new framework using conditional diffusion models for optimizing arithmetic circuits, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing arithmetic circuits like adders and multipliers is challenging due to the vast design space and complex constraints, yet critical for improving performance, power efficiency, and area.

Method: Reframes circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation task using diffusion models conditioned on target quality-of-results, and fine-tunes the model with explored designs near the Pareto frontier.

Result: AC-Refiner outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in generating Pareto optimal designs, validated further through integration into practical applications.

Conclusion: AC-Refiner effectively enhances arithmetic circuit optimization, achieving high-quality designs and better Pareto optimality, showcasing its promise for practical use.

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

*Rui Xie,Asad Ul Haq,Yunhua Fang,Linsen Ma,Sanchari Sen,Swagath Venkataramani,Liu Liu,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative system-level approach to reduce the cost of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) by removing its expensive on-die ECC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HBM offers outstanding AI performance but is hindered by its high cost due to on-die error correction mechanisms.

Method: The authors shift error correction to the controller via a domain-specific ECC framework with Reed--Solomon correction, fine-grained CRC detection, differential parity updates, and tunable data protection.

Result: Under high error rates, the proposed system preserves 78% throughput and 97% model accuracy compared to ideal error-free HBM in Large Language Model inference.

Conclusion: By modifying reliability into a tunable parameter, the paper provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional HBM designs for AI applications.

Abstract: High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) delivers exceptional bandwidth and energy
efficiency for AI workloads, but its high cost per bit, driven in part by
stringent on-die reliability requirements, poses a growing barrier to scalable
deployment. This work explores a system-level approach to cost reduction by
eliminating on-die ECC and shifting all fault management to the memory
controller. We introduce a domain-specific ECC framework combining
large-codeword Reed--Solomon~(RS) correction with lightweight fine-grained CRC
detection, differential parity updates to mitigate write amplification, and
tunable protection based on data importance. Our evaluation using LLM inference
workloads shows that, even under raw HBM bit error rates up to $10^{-3}$, the
system retains over 78\% of throughput and 97\% of model accuracy compared with
systems equipped with ideal error-free HBM. By treating reliability as a
tunable system parameter rather than a fixed hardware constraint, our design
opens a new path toward low-cost, high-performance HBM deployment in AI
infrastructure.

*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces the Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE), addressing bias evaluation gaps in Chinese language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most bias evaluation datasets are English-centric, lacking cultural and task diversity, leaving a gap for Chinese language contexts.

Method: The paper presents McBE, a benchmark with 4,077 instances across 12 categories and 5 tasks, and tests popular LLMs for bias.

Result: Evaluations reveal that LLMs exhibit various levels of bias; detailed analyses provide novel insights.

Conclusion: McBE offers comprehensive tools for assessing biases in Chinese LLMs and demonstrates their bias levels.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [38] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the performance of reasoning and non-reasoning language models in dialogue summarization, finding that step-by-step reasoning often underperforms in complex contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in large language models for summarization tasks, it remains unclear whether stepwise reasoning, such as Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, provides benefits in complex dialogue summarization scenarios.

Method: The study evaluates state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs across three paradigms of dialogue summarization (generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented) using datasets like SAMSum and QMSum, employing both automated and human-inspired evaluation metrics.

Result: Reasoning LLMs displayed challenges such as verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and lack of conciseness, while non-reasoning models often performed better for dialogue summarization.

Conclusion: Stepwise reasoning in LLMs does not consistently enhance dialogue summarization and may even hinder performance in certain contexts, necessitating refined modeling and evaluation strategies for real-world applications.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer designed for latent reasoning in complex tasks. Empirical findings show limited evidence of interpretable latent reasoning, inconsistent hidden state interpretability, and marginal gains with deeper recurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether reasoning processes can be internalized into latent spaces in recurrent architectures rather than externalizing reasoning in natural language for efficiency.

Method: The authors examined the internal behavior of Huginn-3.5B on arithmetic tasks using probing techniques like the Logit Lens and Coda Lens, focusing on the rank trajectories of result tokens and probing recurrent blocks.

Result: Limited evidence of latent chain-of-thought growth was found, with significant inconsistencies across recurrent blocks. Gains from increasing recurrence depth were minimal in comparison to models externalizing reasoning.

Conclusion: Recurrent architectures like Huginn-3.5B reveal limited capacity for latent CoT reasoning. Explicit externalization of reasoning remains superior in efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users may struggle to identify specific cohort descriptors from hundreds of fields in the GDC platform, especially new users. Natural language descriptions could simplify this process.

Method: The paper develops multiple large language models (LLMs) to interpret free-text inputs and automatically generate cohort filters in the GDC, alongside an interactive interface for refinement.

Result: The locally-served, open-source GDC Cohort LLM outperforms GPT-4 in generating cohort filters.

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot enhances the user experience by simplifying cohort curation with natural language inputs and shows promising results in aiding analyses within the GDC platform.

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of processing infinitely long documents without performance degradation during length extrapolation.

Method: MemAgent processes text in segments, updates memory with an overwrite strategy, and uses an extended DAPO algorithm for training via multi-conversation generation.

Result: MemAgent can extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task with less than 5% performance loss. It also achieved over 95% accuracy in the 512K RULER test.

Conclusion: MemAgent demonstrates exceptional capabilities in long-context processing and extrapolation, setting new benchmarks in long-text tasks.

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: DoMIX proposes an efficient method to overcome computational, sensitivity, and generalization issues in Domain-Adaptive Pre-training through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high GPU usage, sensitivity to order of incremental data, and the contradiction of providing a single generalized model in current continual Domain-Adaptive Pre-training methods.

Method: The paper introduces DoMIX, incorporating LoRA modules, which enable parameter-efficient, parallel, and domain-order robust pre-training to create specific tailored models.

Result: DoMIX efficiently accumulates and uses domain knowledge while outperforming traditional methods in creating tailored models for specific tasks.

Conclusion: DoMIX offers a scalable improvement in Domain-Adaptive Pre-training and is extendable to general Large Language Model fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominant parameter contribution of feedforward networks (FFNs) in standard Transformer encoder blocks drives the motivation for investigating PQC-based replacements for FFNs to improve efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors systematically design PQC layers using residual connections, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and alternating entanglement strategies. They evaluate their design on SST-2 and DBpedia benchmarks using classical simulators.

Result: QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% accuracy compared to baseline, reduces FFN-specific parameters by over 99%, and performs well in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: This study confirms that PQCs are viable alternatives to classical FFNs, offering parameter-efficiency and superior data efficiency when co-designed with deep learning principles.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to select high-quality code data for training large language models, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLMs focus on data quantity over quality, reducing training efficiency.

Method: A parametric model is used for code data selection, optimizing for distribution consistency and sample diversity.

Result: With only 10K samples, the method outperforms a 92K full-sampled baseline by 2.4% on HumanEval and 2.3% on MBPP.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves training efficiency, enhances model performance, and reduces computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks seven Akan ASR models using diverse datasets and identifies domain dependency, error behaviors across architectures, and the need for improved adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR research often lacks evaluation across diverse speech contexts, which is critical for low-resource languages like Akan.

Method: Researchers evaluated seven transformer-based Akan ASR models (Whisper and Wav2Vec2) using four distinct speech corpora across different domains.

Result: Findings reveal domain dependency, highlighting a decline in performance for mismatched domains. Whisper models produce fluent but misleading errors, whereas Wav2Vec2 outputs are less interpretable.

Conclusion: Targeted domain adaptation, adaptive strategies, and multilingual frameworks are essential for enhancing ASR performance in low-resource language applications.

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Abstract: This study presents an approach for collecting speech samples to build
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for impaired speech, particularly,
low-resource languages. It aims to democratize ASR technology and data
collection by developing a "cookbook" of best practices and training for
community-driven data collection and ASR model building. As a proof-of-concept,

the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study
presents the initial results of fine-tuning open-source ASR models to better
recognize impaired speech in Akan.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces WebSailor, a post-training methodology that enables open-source models to match proprietary systems on complex information-seeking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of open-source models in handling extreme uncertainty and complex information-seeking benchmarks compared to proprietary systems.

Method: The paper proposes WebSailor, which includes structured sampling, information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an RL algorithm named Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO).

Result: WebSailor enables open-source models to significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art agents and rival proprietary systems like DeepResearch on complex tasks.

Conclusion: WebSailor bridges the performance gap between open-source and proprietary systems, emphasizing its potential in tackling high-uncertainty tasks.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

### [50] [Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593)
*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conceptual framework for active learning (AL) that incorporates human label variation (HLV), addressing issues of label variation and large language model integration in supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised learning methods often rely on a single ground truth assumption, overlooking human label variation (HLV). This gap limits the capacity of annotation frameworks to leverage informative signals from differing but plausible annotations.

Method: The authors survey existing approaches in active learning (AL) and label variation (LV), propose a conceptual framework for HLV-aware active learning, and explore methods for better incorporating HLV in the AL workflow, including the use of large language models as annotators.

Result: The paper provides a systematic analysis of the challenges in current AL approaches and offers a structured methodology to integrate HLV into instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation.

Conclusion: Adopting HLV-aware active learning frameworks can improve training models under real-world annotation complexities, making them more robust and reflective of practical challenges in supervised learning.

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

### [51] [MPF: Aligning and Debiasing Language Models post Deployment via Multi Perspective Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02595)
*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes Multiperspective Fusion (MPF), a framework for mitigating biases in large language models (LLMs) without the need for extensive finetuning or prompt engineering. It aligns LLM outputs to humanlike baselines using multiperspective generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the growing demand for effective and accessible methods to mitigate biases in LLM outputs, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.

Method: MPF operates by using the SAGED pipeline to construct bias benchmarks. It decomposes humanlike baselines into interpretable perspective components and aligns LLMs by weighting and balancing outputs according to these components during generation.

Result: MPF successfully aligns LLM sentiment distributions to both counterfactual and HR-specific baselines, evidenced by small KL divergence, reduced calibration error, and the ability to generalize to unseen questions.

Conclusion: MPF provides a scalable, interpretable bias mitigation tool that works post-training, eliminating the need for time-intensive finetuning or detailed prompt design, thus making it suitable for currently deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Motivation: Understand bias in language regarding action verbs, object nouns, and occupations, particularly its gender correlations.

Method: The researchers created the GenderLexicon dataset and developed a bias estimation framework that provides interpretable bias scores.

Result: The study reveals gender biases beyond occupational stereotypes and validates its approach across five datasets, including one Japanese dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset enhance understanding of gender-related biases in language use and promote improved explainability.

particularly on occupations. We introduce a novel dataset, GenderLexicon, and a
framework that can estimate contextual bias and its related gender bias. Our

beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a
Japanese dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LimitGen, a benchmark to assess LLMs' ability to identify limitations in scientific research, and proposes an augmented method using literature retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of providing constructive peer review in the face of increasing scientific publications, focusing on enhancing LLMs for identifying research limitations.

Method: The authors created LimitGen, a benchmark with two datasets: synthetic (LimitGen-Syn) and human-written limitations (LimitGen-Human). They augmented LLMs by incorporating literature retrieval to identify and generate research limitations.

Result: The proposed method improved LLMs' ability to identify and articulate limitations in research papers, enabling more grounded and constructive peer review.

Conclusion: LimitGen provides a structured foundation to evaluate and enhance LLMs for peer review tasks, specifically in identifying limitations. This contributes to better early-stage feedback in scientific research.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper estimates the 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD)—the minimum distance in auditory space needed for reliable differentiation in vowel imitation—ranging between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the control mechanisms behind human vowel production, specifically the accuracy and limitations of auditory space targeting, to explore implications for theories of speech and vowel system organization.

Method: The study employed a vowel mimicry paradigm to measure JPD in front vowel production among English speakers, determining the minimal perceptible auditory distance between two vowel stimuli.

Result: Results indicate that the JPD ranges between 14 and 51 mels in auditory space, establishing an estimate of vowel differentiation thresholds.

Conclusion: This research provides a theoretical lower-bound explanation for vowel phoneme arrangements and supports episodic theories of speech production by identifying psychophysical limits in human vowel systems.

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Self-Correction Blind Spot' in LLMs, where these models fail to correct their own mistakes, and proposes a benchmark to measure this issue. Results show a 64.5% blind spot rate across 14 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the systematic inability of LLMs to self-correct their own errors, unlike their capability to identify errors in user input.

Method: The study employs a framework called 'Self-Correction Bench' for error injection at three complexity levels. It tests 14 models and analyzes blind spot rates and potential links to training data composition.

Result: Findings show a 64.5% average blind spot rate across models, with evidence linking this issue to training data containing mostly error-free interactions. A simple 'Wait' prompt reduces blind spots by 89.3%.

Conclusion: The research identifies a critical limitation of LLMs in self-correction and provides insights for improving their reliability. It suggests that self-correction capabilities exist but require better activation strategies.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

*Riccardo Cantini,Nicola Gabriele,Alessio Orsino,Domenico Talia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) for their robustness to social biases using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark. It finds that reasoning mechanisms may inadvertently increase vulnerability to bias elicitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how reasoning capabilities in RLMs influence robustness to social biases, and challenging the assumption that reasoning improves model fairness and safety.

Method: Using the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, automated safety scoring by an LLM-as-a-judge, and jailbreak techniques to test bias elicitation attacks.

Result: Models with explicit reasoning capabilities are more vulnerable to bias elicitation compared to base models, suggesting reasoning mechanisms may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes. Fine-tuned reasoning traces are safer than CoT prompting.

Conclusion: Reasoning does not inherently improve robustness to biases and may require more bias-aware approaches to its design.

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MathV-DP, a dataset emphasizing diverse mathematical reasoning, and Qwen-VL-DP, a fine-tuned model that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance solution diversity and correctness, achieving superior results in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning in multimodal large language models often relies on limited, single-solution supervision and overlooks the benefits of diverse reasoning perspectives, which hinders their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors develop MathV-DP, a dataset providing diverse solution trajectories for image-question pairs, and propose Qwen-VL-DP, a model trained using supervised learning with reinforcement learning techniques like group relative policy optimization for diversity-aware reasoning.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP achieves significant improvements in accuracy and generative diversity compared to prior multimodal language models, as validated by experiments on MathVista’s minitest and Math-V benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse reasoning perspectives and reflective learning greatly enhances the mathematical reasoning capabilities and performance of multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to dynamically assign medical questions to either high-complexity (thinking) or low-cost (non-thinking) modes of large language models (LLMs), achieving better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing use of LLMs, there's a need to balance their performance and operational costs, especially given the growing cost disparity between reasoning-capable and simpler modes.

Method: The authors introduce SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing system that assigns queries to either thinking or non-thinking modes based on their complexity.

Result: SynapseRoute improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs. 0.8272), reduces inference time by 36.8%, and cuts token consumption by 39.66% compared to using the thinking mode alone.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing based on query complexity optimizes LLM usage by reducing cost and improving efficiency while avoiding errors from over-reasoning on simple queries. The AIT index is also introduced to evaluate trade-offs in such systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Method: Developed IFBench with 58 diverse constraints and proposed reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve model performance.

Result: The study showcases that RLVR significantly enhances precise instruction following on out-of-domain constraints.

Conclusion: Precise instruction generalization remains a challenge for existing models, and the methods proposed in the paper—including IFBench and RLVR—provide substantial progress.

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

### [60] [LLM Hypnosis: Exploiting User Feedback for Unauthorized Knowledge Injection to All Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02850)
*Almog Hilel,Idan Shenfeld,Leshem Choshen,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in language models (LMs) where a single user can gradually manipulate LM behavior through targeted feedback mechanisms, resulting in harmful or biased outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the risks of using user feedback mechanisms in training language models by showing that even highly limited feedback (upvotes/downvotes) can lead to significant harmful manipulations in model behavior.

Method: The attack involves stochastic prompting to generate poisoned or benign outputs, followed by feedback manipulation (upvotes/downvotes). The subsequent preference tuning makes the LM favor the poisoned outputs in unrelated contexts.

Result: The authors demonstrate that this attack allows the attacker to insert previously unknown facts into the LM, alter its code generation to introduce security flaws, and propagate fake financial news.

Conclusion: Preference tuning with feedback mechanisms poses a security weakness that can be exploited by attackers. This highlights the need for robust protection mechanisms to preserve LM integrity when integrating user feedback.

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

### [61] [MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Fine-tuning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02851)
*Purbesh Mitra,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MOTIF, a novel modular thinking strategy using reinforcement finetuning to enable LLMs to reason beyond their context size limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face reasoning limitations due to their finite context size, which restricts their attention and thinking abilities during token generation.

Method: MOTIF employs reinforcement finetuning to train models for modular thinking, allowing reasoning in multiple rounds with enhanced context size.

Result: The proposed method yields 3.8% and 3.3% accuracy improvements in GSM8K-based benchmarks compared to GRPO training, achieving these results with only 15% of training samples.

Conclusion: MOTIF improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs while being sample-efficient, offering a promising approach for overcoming context size limitations in language models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

### [62] [Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856)
*Nikhil Chandak,Shashwat Goel,Ameya Prabhu,Moritz Hardt,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the reliability of multiple-choice benchmarks for language model evaluation, proposing generative evaluation through 'answer matching' as a superior alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability and validity of language model evaluations, which currently rely heavily on multiple-choice formats that have exploitable flaws.

Method: The authors propose 'answer matching,' where the candidate model generates free-form responses, and another language model determines if the response matches a reference answer.

Result: Generative 'answer matching' achieves near-perfect agreement with human grading, while traditional multiple-choice and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations perform poorly by comparison.

Conclusion: Answer matching provides a scalable and reliable approach to model evaluation, and transitioning the evaluation ecosystem from multiple-choice to generative formats is recommended.

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies the effectiveness of monocular metric depth estimation models in underwater environments, identifying issues due to domain shifts, and improving them through domain adaptation using synthetic underwater data for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation struggles in underwater conditions due to light attenuation, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality ground-truth data, making reliable metric predictions difficult.

Method: The authors benchmarked several models using real-world underwater datasets (FLSea and SQUID) and fine-tuned a Depth Anything V2 model with synthetic underwater data using a physically based image formation model.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed consistent performance improvement across benchmarks, outperforming models trained only on terrestrial data.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and scale-aware supervision are essential for robust monocular metric depth prediction in underwater environments, paving the path for future research.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

### [65] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ESTR-CoT, a framework for event stream-based scene text recognition that utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning and large language models to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical reasoning in existing event stream-based scene text recognition methods.

Method: The ESTR-CoT framework incorporates a vision encoder (EVA-CLIP) to process event streams into tokens and a tokenizer (Llama) to encode prompts. A Q-former then aligns these tokens with a large language model (Vicuna-7B) to simultaneously generate answers and chain-of-thought reasoning steps. The framework is trained using supervised fine-tuning on a custom dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) demonstrated the effectiveness and improved interpretability of the proposed ESTR-CoT framework.

Conclusion: The study presents ESTR-CoT as an innovation in event stream-based scene text recognition, enhancing performance and interpretability through a novel chain-of-thought reasoning approach. A new dataset is also introduced to further advance reasoning-based models.

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on

*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot multimodal approach for recognizing compound emotions using six modalities, outperforming some supervised methods without domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of detecting complex emotional states without relying on labeled training data by introducing a zero-shot approach.

Method: They integrate six heterogeneous modalities (static/dynamic facial expressions, scene/label matching, scene context, audio, and text) with zero-shot components and a Multi-Head Probability Fusion module for interpretable compound emotion detection.

Result: The approach achieves competitive F1 scores (46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02% on AFEW, and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB) comparable to supervised methods without the need for domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The multimodal zero-shot approach demonstrates the potential for effective compound emotion recognition without requiring task-specific labeled training data.

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SciGA-145k, a dataset supporting research in graphical abstract (GA) selection, recommendation, and automated generation to improve visual scientific communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) are valuable for visually summarizing scientific papers, but their adoption is limited by design complexity and underexplored utility.

Method: The researchers used a dataset of 145,000 papers with 1.14 million figures, defining two recommendation tasks (intra-GA and inter-GA) alongside developing a new evaluation metric, CAR, for analyzing model performance.

Result: Baseline models for GA recommendation tasks were provided, and CAR was demonstrated as an effective metric for evaluating multi-GA suitability.

Conclusion: SciGA-145k creates a foundation for advancing tools in scientific visualization and supporting automation in GA creation, contributing to improved science communication.

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies the effectiveness of synthetic data generated by diffusion models for visual object detection and compares the effect of different conditioning methods on data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial vision systems often face challenges in robust object detection due to the difficulty and time required in collecting high-quality training data.

Method: The researchers use diffusion models to generate high-quality, synthetic visual data, comparing two conditioning strategies: prompt-based and layout-based.

Result: Synthetic data generated with layout cues that match the full training distribution can outperform real data, raising mean average precision by an average of 34% and up to 177%.

Conclusion: Diffusion models with proper conditioning can significantly enhance object detection performance, especially in low data regimes, while reducing the reliance on time-consuming real-data collection processes.

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIDB-ViT, a binary vision transformer (ViT) overcoming performance issues of existing binary ViTs while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation and reliance on full-precision modules in existing binary ViTs when deployed on edge devices.

Method: The DIDB-ViT employs an informative attention module, frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet for similarity calculations, and an improved RPReLU activation function to enhance performance.

Result: DIDB-ViT surpasses state-of-the-art network quantization methods in various ViT architectures for image classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT offers a novel binarization mechanism for ViTs, effectively balancing high performance and computational efficiency for edge-device applications.

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving robot object detection while moving by deploying quantized neural networks on FPGA hardware using the FINN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots typically slow down due to detection algorithms constrained by camera framerates, leading to increased task execution time. Efficient deployment on FPGA could mitigate these issues.

Method: Three quantized ANN models were trained on the RG2C dataset and deployed to FPGA hardware using the FINN architecture, with quantisation levels of 4-bit, 2-bit, and 1-bit.

Result: MobileNet v1 with 4-bit quantisation achieved a success rate of 98% and an inference speed of 6611 FPS.

Conclusion: Deploying ANNs on FPGAs improves detection speed and performance, making them viable for advanced attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FMOcc, a method for more accurate 3D semantic occupancy prediction using selective flow matching and viewpoint refinement techniques, particularly for few-frame inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, such as difficulty with occluded and distant scenes due to limited image frames and redundancies in 3D space.

Method: The method involves a Flow Matching SSM module (FMSSM) to refine features and a Tri-perspective View Selective State Space Model (TPV SSM and PS3M) to focus computational effort on relevant voxels, alongside a Mask Training (MT) method for enhanced robustness against sensor data loss.

Result: Experimental results show that FMOcc significantly improves performance, achieving state-of-the-art scores on Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets, while maintaining efficient memory usage and inference time.

Conclusion: FMOcc demonstrates strong performance and efficiency, making it a valuable solution for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving with few-frame inputs.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgVisAgent is introduced as an intelligent multimodal model for enhancing endoscopic images across diverse distortions, outperforming single-task models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current algorithms for surgical assistance are task-specific and struggle to handle complex, multifaceted scenarios in real surgeries.

Method: SurgVisAgent employs multimodal large language models, domain-specific knowledge through a prior model, in-context few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning to adaptively identify and enhance endoscopic images.

Result: Experiments on a real-world benchmark of surgical distortions demonstrated SurgVisAgent’s superior performance in multiple enhancement tasks compared to traditional models.

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent showcases a promising unified approach to tackle diverse surgical image distortion challenges, improving surgeon decision-making and patient safety.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-label classification method using aerial imagery and achieves a 90.23% mean average precision in hurricane damage assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label classification methods are inadequate for capturing the complexity of hurricane damage types and severity.

Method: The approach uses a ResNet-based feature extraction combined with a class-specific attention mechanism to identify multiple damage types in aerial images.

Result: Achieved 90.23% mean average precision using the Rescuenet dataset from Hurricane Michael, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves post-hurricane damage assessment, aiding in targeted disaster response and contributing to better mitigation and resilience strategies.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify

### [74] [Cross-domain Hyperspectral Image Classification based on Bi-directional Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02268)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiDA, a framework for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification, aiming to address spectral shift problems between domains, using a transformer-based architecture and innovative mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the study is to tackle the spectral shifts between source and target domains in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, which affect classification accuracy across different regions and times.

Method: The method involves designing a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework with a triple-branch transformer architecture. It includes a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention mechanism for feature interaction, a bi-directional distillation loss for learning adaptive spaces, and an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to enhance feature extraction under noise.

Result: Experiments show that BiDA significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation approaches on cross-temporal/scene datasets. In a cross-temporal tree species classification task, it achieves 3%~5% higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: BiDA demonstrates its effectiveness for cross-domain hyperspectral image classification by extracting domain-invariant and specific features, making it impactful in addressing variations in spectral characteristics across domains.

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images often suffer from quality issues due to environmental challenges like light changes and water turbidity, making enhancement crucial for exploration.

Method: The proposed MAC-Lookup model combines Conditional 3D Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for initial adjustments with Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detailed refinements.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that MAC-Lookup outperforms existing methods in restoring colors and details in underwater images.

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup offers a superior solution for underwater image enhancement, effectively addressing over-enhancement and saturation issues while improving visual quality and detail restoration.

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.

learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis

improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-distillation approach to improve Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation models for handling scenarios with partial visual information, enhancing performance on datasets like VGGSound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A generation methods fail to consider cinematic language, leading to poor performance when Foley targets are only partially visible.

Method: The paper proposes a self-distillation approach where a student model learns to align video features with the same audio-visual correspondences in training pairs, simulating variations in cinematic language.

Result: The proposed method provides significant improvements in partial visibility scenarios across all evaluation metrics and enhances performance on the VGGSound dataset.

Conclusion: By addressing cinematic language and partial visual information, the proposed approach enhances the robustness and effectiveness of V2A models in both specific and large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LaCo, a method to improve visual token compression in multimodal large language models, by operating within intermediate layers of the vision encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token compression methods operate post-encoding, limiting efficiency gains.

Method: Proposes LaCo, which uses (1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism for spatial-to-channel token transformations and (2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts.

Result: LaCo outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20% faster training efficiency, 15% improved inference throughput, and strong model performance.

Conclusion: LaCo achieves superior efficiency and performance in intermediate-layer token compression for vision encoders.

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

### [78] [Prompt Disentanglement via Language Guidance and Representation Alignment for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02288)
*De Cheng,Zhipeng Xu,Xinyang Jiang,Dongsheng Li,Nannan Wang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving Domain Generalization (DG) for unseen target domains using pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). It introduces a framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning and enhances it with Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA). Extensive experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art DG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of improving model generalization on unseen target domains in DG, leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained VFMs like CLIP, and designing effective prompts to disentangle domain-invariant features across diverse domains.

Method: The framework uses language prompts from VFMs for visual prompt tuning. It employs a large language model for automatic text prompt disentanglement, guiding domain-invariant visual representation learning. Additionally, it introduces Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA) to integrate stylized image augmentations and alignment constraints for enhanced visual domain diversity.

Result: Experiments on major DG datasets such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art DG methods.

Conclusion: The proposed text feature-guided visual prompt tuning combined with WERA effectively enhances domain generalization, offering advancements in disentangling invariant features and ensuring consistent visual representations across diverse domains.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViRefSAM enhances SAM's functionality for remote sensing image segmentation by enabling automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects using few-shot learning and reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM struggles with manual prompt generation and lacks domain adaptability in remote sensing segmentation tasks, motivating the need for a solution.

Method: ViRefSAM introduces a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder for generating prompts from reference images and a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter for domain gap mitigation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate ViRefSAM's superior performance over existing methods in few-shot segmentation across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViRefSAM resolves SAM's challenges in remote sensing by leveraging only a few annotated reference images, enabling accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamComposer++ improves view-aware diffusion models by integrating multi-view conditions for generating controllable novel views with high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models generate high-quality novel views but lack controllability due to insufficient multi-view data.

Method: The paper proposes DreamComposer++, which uses a view-aware 3D lifting module and a multi-view feature fusion module to aggregate and render 3D object representations into pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: Experimental results validate that DreamComposer++ enhances the ability of diffusion models to generate controllable novel views using multi-view conditions.

Conclusion: DreamComposer++ is a flexible and scalable framework that improves 3D object reconstruction and broadens applications in view synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow-CDNet, a network for detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images, validated with a self-built dataset and custom metrics, showing superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of approaches capable of detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images, which are important in real-world scenarios for early warning of hazards.

Method: They propose Flow-CDNet, a dual-branch network comprising an optical flow branch for displacement changes and a binary change detection branch combining ResNet-based networks. They also develop a custom dataset, a hybrid loss function, and a new evaluation metric.

Result: Experiments on the self-built Flow-Change dataset showed that Flow-CDNet outperforms existing methods. Ablation studies demonstrated mutual enhancement of the network's two branches.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet successfully addresses the challenge of detecting both slow and fast changes in bitemporal images, validated by strong experimental results and custom metrics.

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

### [82] [LMPNet for Weakly-supervised Keypoint Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02308)
*Pei Guo,Ryan Farrell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMPNet, a weakly-supervised model for semantic object keypoint detection using only category labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keypoint detection is crucial for tasks like pose estimation but usually demands substantial labeled data. This work aims to achieve accurate keypoint detection using only weak supervision based on category labels.

Method: The approach involves transforming intermediate neural network filters into keypoint detectors, using a novel leaky max pooling (LMP) layer to foster local pattern recognition. It also applies filter selection strategies, attention mask-out, and a clustering layer to finalize keypoint predictions.

Result: LMPNet automatically discovers semantically meaningful keypoints that are robust to pose variations. It delivers prediction accuracy comparable to fully supervised models.

Conclusion: The proposed LMPNet is interpretable and efficient, achieving effective keypoint detection using weak supervision and demonstrating the feasibility of reducing dependency on extensive labeled data.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances brain-vision decoding by integrating fMRI signals via cross-attention, improving performance on semantic tasks like object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current brain-vision decoding models suffer from semantic distortions and inadequate integration of semantic-level information.

Method: The researchers proposed using fMRI signals as intervention conditions, integrating them into multi-scale image features through cross-attention, and analyzing their impact on object detection and segmentation.

Result: Incorporating fMRI representations improved downstream object detection and instance segmentation tasks by providing rich semantic cues and spatial information.

Conclusion: fMRI signals hold underutilized multi-object semantic and spatial information, which can significantly enhance decoding models.

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

*JaeHyuck Choi,MinJun Kim,JeHyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGIC, a method for few-shot anomaly generation in industrial quality control that addresses previously unmet demands for realistic and precise anomaly synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of anomaly data in industrial quality control necessitates effective data augmentation techniques that can produce realistic and diverse anomalies while preserving background integrity.

Method: MAGIC combines fine-tuned Stable Diffusion inpainting with Gaussian prompt perturbation, spatial noise injection, and context-aware mask alignment to accurately and realistically generate anomalies.

Result: MAGIC surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in performance on the MVTec-AD dataset for anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: MAGIC effectively resolves key issues in anomaly generation by preserving normal regions, adhering to precise masks, and ensuring anomalies are generated in semantically valid locations.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynTVA, a dataset and benchmark to evaluate synthetic video's utility for text-to-video retrieval tasks, focusing on semantic alignment dimensions and predictive metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for text-to-video synthesis fail to provide insights on their downstream utility for text-to-video retrieval, necessitating a benchmark for exact purposes.

Method: They created SynTVA by generating synthetic videos from advanced T2V models for 800 user queries, annotating them across alignment dimensions, incorporating a general evaluation framework, and developing an Auto-Evaluator.

Result: SynTVA revealed correlations between semantic alignment scores and TVR performance, and facilitated dataset augmentation to improve retrieval outcomes.

Conclusion: SynTVA is a valuable resource, not just for evaluation but for dataset augmentation, improving text-to-video retrieval tasks by leveraging high-utility synthetic videos.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

TL;DR: The paper presents InnerControl, a novel training strategy that enhances spatial consistency in all diffusion steps for text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models remains a challenge, and existing methods such as ControlNet++ have limitations in addressing intermediate generation stages.

Method: InnerControl utilizes lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control signals from intermediate UNet features at every denoising step, enforcing spatial consistency across the entire diffusion process.

Result: The approach improves control fidelity and image generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with methods like ControlNet++.

Conclusion: InnerControl advances the precision of spatial control in text-to-image models, offering superior alignment and generation quality compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

TL;DR: The paper introduces DexVLG, a vision-language-grasp model for predicting dexterous grasp poses based on language instructions using single-view RGBD input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle with functional grasping for dexterous human-like hands due to data collection limitations. The study aims to address this gap using large models.

Method: DexVLG employs a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasps mapped to semantic parts and part-level captions, trained via a vision-language model and pose prediction mechanisms.

Result: DexVLG achieves a 76% zero-shot execution success rate, state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulations, and successful real-world grasps.

Conclusion: DexVLG demonstrates promising potential for dexterous grasping tasks, showing strong generalization and effectiveness in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

*Farida Siddiqi Prity,Mirza Raquib,Saydul Akbar Murad,Md. Jubayar Alam Rafi,Md. Khairul Bashar Bhuiyan,Anupam Kumar Bairagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based system for rice leaf disease detection, comparing Feature Analysis Detection Model (FADM) to Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM). FADM outperforms, enhancing disease detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rice diseases cause significant economic losses, necessitating effective and early detection methodologies to improve yield and management.

Method: The study employs Feature Analysis Detection Model (with FEAs, DRAs, FSAs, and Extreme Learning Machine) and a Direct Image-Centric Detection Model. Performance is compared using 10-fold cross-validation on datasets of various rice diseases.

Result: The Feature Analysis Detection Model outperformed the Direct Image-Centric Detection Model in classification metrics for rice leaf diseases.

Conclusion: The Feature Analysis Detection Model presents a superior method for detecting rice leaf diseases, with potential benefits for crop health, productivity, and sustainability.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

*Rafic Nader,Vincent L'Allinec,Romain Bourcier,Florent Autrusseau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fully automated neural network-based approach for detecting bifurcation landmarks in the Circle of Willis (CoW), addressing challenges like missed detections and anatomical variabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The detection of bifurcations in the Circle of Willis is crucial for diagnosing intracranial aneurysms, and manual methods are both time-consuming and prone to errors.

Method: The method involves a two-step process: (1) An object detection network identifies regions of interest near bifurcations, and (2) a modified U-Net with deep supervision accurately locates these landmarks.

Result: Experimental evaluation using both an in-house dataset and a public dataset shows that the proposed method achieves the highest performance for bifurcation detection.

Conclusion: The approach successfully automates bifurcation landmark detection, addressing challenges like proximity-based missed detections and anatomical variability, enabling efficient diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Conclusion: The model effectively balances accuracy and efficiency, offering robust technical support for intelligent shrimp disease detection in aquaculture, validated through extensive experiments and generalization tests.

Abstract: Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

### [91] [Holistic Tokenizer for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02358)
*Anlin Zheng,Haochen Wang,Yucheng Zhao,Weipeng Deng,Tiancai Wang,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hita, a new image tokenizer, improves autoregressive (AR) image generation by introducing holistic-to-local tokenization and advanced token alignment mechanisms. It achieves superior performance on benchmarks like ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of vanilla autoregressive image generation models, specifically their inability to capture holistic relationships among visual tokens and the restricted global information due to local patch mappings by existing visual tokenizers.

Method: Hita incorporates a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme using learnable holistic queries and patch tokens. It structures tokens sequentially (holistic followed by patch) with causal attention, and uses a fusion module to prioritize holistic context before passing tokens to the decoder.

Result: Hita accelerates AR generator training and surpasses models with vanilla tokenizers, achieving milestones such as 2.59 FID and 281.9 IS on ImageNet. It also proves effective in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Conclusion: Hita demonstrates the significance of holistic tokenization for AR image generation, enabling better global representation of textures, materials, and shapes, and offering a substantial performance improvement over traditional approaches.

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

*Jiahao Wu,Rui Peng,Jianbo Jiao,Jiayu Yang,Luyang Tang,Kaiqiang Xiong,Jie Liang,Jinbo Yan,Runling Liu,Ronggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LocalDyGS, a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework capable of handling both large and fine-scale motion using local decomposition and feature decoupling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in synthesizing dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints due to complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world.

Method: The approach involves: (1) decomposing complex dynamic scenes into local spaces defined by seeds for global modeling of motion, and (2) decoupling static and dynamic features within local spaces to capture time-specific details.

Result: LocalDyGS achieves competitive performance on fine-scale datasets compared to SOTA methods and pioneers modeling large-scale, highly dynamic real-world scenes.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS effectively models dynamic real-world scenes, addressing limitations of previous methods and broadening applications by enabling realistic reconstruction of highly dynamic environments.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UVLM, a benchmark for underwater video language models (VidLMs), focusing on the unique challenges of underwater observation and offering diverse data and evaluation metrics to enhance AI capabilities in underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video language models primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios and fail to address the growing need for effective solutions in underwater observation.

Method: The authors created the UVLM benchmark by combining human expertise and AI models, ensuring data quality through curated selections of underwater videos representing varied challenges, diversifying datasets, and structuring observation tasks into biological and environmental categories.

Result: Experiments show that fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves their performance in understanding underwater environments and slightly enhances results on terrestrial VidLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: UVLM addresses the gap in underwater video observation AI by providing a comprehensive benchmark with diverse data and tasks. It lays the foundation for advancing VidLMs in underwater scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

*Seokyeong Lee,Sithu Aung,Junyong Choi,Seungryong Kim,Ig-Jae Kim,Junghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust pseudo-labeling framework for monocular 3D object detection using only video data without additional equipment, multi-view setups, or domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection faces challenges due to data scarcity from high annotation costs and 2D-to-3D ambiguity; existing methods have limitations like domain dependency and reliance on single observation shape data.

Method: The approach aggregates pseudo-LiDARs from temporally adjacent frames, using object point tracking to extract 3D attributes, eliminating the need for complex setups or additional hardware.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves reliable accuracy and scalability, making it well-suited for different scenarios in M3OD.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is an effective and practical solution for addressing challenges in monocular 3D object detection.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoMEL, a framework combining MIL with continual learning and localization, achieving superior performance in histopathological image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIL approaches effectively reduce annotation costs but struggle to combine instance-level localization with adaptability in continual tasks without significant forgetting, especially for histopathological data.

Method: CoMEL integrates three key components: GDAT for efficient encoding, BPPL for accurate pseudo-labeling, and OWLoRA to mitigate task forgetting.

Result: CoMEL achieves up to 11% improvement in bag-level accuracy and up to 23.4% improvement in localization accuracy across three public WSI datasets.

Conclusion: CoMEL is a significant advancement in continual MIL for histopathological image analyses, addressing encoding, labeling reliability, and adaptability challenges effectively.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

*Taehoon Kim,Jongwook Choi,Yonghyun Jeong,Haeun Noh,Jaejun Yoo,Seungryul Baek,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an innovative approach to deepfake video detection by identifying pixel-level temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods based on spatial frequency spectra fail to capture pixel-level temporal artifacts, limiting their accuracy.

Method: The proposed method uses a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for every pixel to identify temporal inconsistencies, combined with an attention proposal module and a joint transformer integrating spatial and temporal features.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved detection of deepfake artifacts across various challenging scenarios, including subtle forgeries.

Conclusion: By addressing temporal artifacts at the pixel level, this method advances the field of deepfake detection and enhances robustness against diverse manipulation techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

*Peilin Zhang,Shaouxan Wua,Jun Feng,Zhuo Jin,Zhizezhang Gao,Jingkun Chen,Yaqiong Xing,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TAB Net, a novel framework for medical image segmentation using sparse scribble annotations to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and effort of obtaining large-scale annotated medical image datasets make weakly supervised segmentation via scribble annotations an attractive alternative, but the sparse nature of such annotations creates challenges for network training.

Method: TAB Net combines the Triplet Augmentation Self-Recovery (TAS) module for better feature learning via three diverse augmentation strategies, and the Boundary-Aware Pseudo-Label Supervision (BAP) module for refining pseudo-label accuracy and boundary modeling.

Result: Experiments on the ACDC and MSCMR seg datasets show that TAB Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weakly supervised scenarios and achieves performance comparable to fully supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed TAB Net addresses limitations in scribble-based weakly supervised segmentation, offering a cost-effective solution with strong segmentation performance.

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

TL;DR: This study explores self-supervised learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification, leveraging temporal image pairs from camera trap data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the reliance on annotated data for training supervised models and extend the applicability of wildlife re-identification tasks.

Method: The authors use self-supervised learning by extracting temporal image pairs from camera trap videos to train a model without any labeled data.

Result: Self-supervised models are more robust than supervised models, even with limited data, and outperform them in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning offers an effective and scalable alternative to supervised methods for wildlife re-identification, showcasing improved robustness and performance.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper integrates an encoder into denoising diffusion models to create a hybrid diffusion auto-encoding framework that offers better latent space structuring and addresses tasks like brain tissue differentiation, artifact restoration, and JPEG artifact repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Denoising diffusion models excel at high-fidelity image sampling, but they lack a mechanism to extract image-specific semantic representations, a strength of auto-encoders.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion auto-encoding model by integrating an encoder with diffusion models. They structure the latent space using positional regression of image patches and utilize this for brain tissue differentiation, tear artifact restoration, and JPEG artifact restoration.

Result: The proposed framework enables organizing the latent space for better semantic differentiation, unsupervised tear artifact restoration using neighborhood awareness, and unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration by guiding latent representations.

Conclusion: By combining the strengths of denoising diffusion models and auto-encoders, the study develops methods to extract better latent representations for structured tasks, showcasing improved artifact restoration and tissue differentiation capabilities.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB camera surveillance systems struggle under low light or poor visibility conditions, but thermal sensors can enhance recognition tasks. However, their low-level feature representation poses challenges for detecting and tracking pedestrians.

Method: A two-stage framework is proposed for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing the motion pattern handling in thermal imagery to improve real-time tracking.

Result: Experiments on the PBVS Thermal MOT dataset show high tracking accuracy and robustness across various thermal camera conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for surveillance applications, addressing the challenges in pedestrian tracking for thermal imagery.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face identification systems in the ciphertext domain struggle with speed as the ciphertext template libraries grow, necessitating more efficient methods.

Method: The authors propose PFIP, which uses an innovative preselection mechanism and a packing module to reduce computation and improve system flexibility.

Result: Experiments confirm PFIP maintains the original face recognition model's accuracy while achieving a 100% hit rate and 50x faster retrieval compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PFIP proves to be a groundbreaking solution for privacy-preserving face retrieval, ensuring both high accuracy and significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of unreliable and inefficient manual structural crack detection, and to improve the accuracy and reliability of automated systems.

Method: The study employed residual U-Net models integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model using convolutional blocks. Their performance was benchmarked against SegNet and traditional U-Net models.

Result: The residual U-Net models outperformed traditional architectures, especially for low-resolution images, while the ensemble model achieved the highest performance based on IoU and DICE metrics.

Conclusion: The ensemble model offers a highly accurate and efficient solution for structural crack detection, paving the way for more dependable automated monitoring systems.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

### [103] [AvatarMakeup: Realistic Makeup Transfer for 3D Animatable Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02419)
*Yiming Zhong,Xiaolin Zhang,Ligang Liu,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AvatarMakeup, a method for realistic 3D avatar makeup using a pretrained diffusion model to achieve high consistency, identity preservation, and detailed control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in current 3D Gaussian editing methods in achieving realistic makeup effects for virtual avatars, focusing on consistency, identity preservation, and fine detail control.

Method: The authors propose AvatarMakeup, a method utilizing a pretrained diffusion model for transferring makeup patterns from reference photos, involving coarse-to-fine optimization with Coherent Duplication and a Refinement Module.

Result: Experiments show that AvatarMakeup provides state-of-the-art quality in makeup transfer, maintaining appearance consistency and identity throughout animations.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup successfully enhances virtual avatar makeup with superior transfer quality and animation consistency, overcoming existing challenges in the field.

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses adapting medical source models to incoming, fragmented, and unpredictable domain inputs using a novel framework called I-DiPT, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting medical site models to unlabeled test datasets in unpredictable scenarios, driven by the high cost of data annotation.

Method: Proposed Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT) framework, supported by Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM) and Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD).

Result: Experiments on breast cancer and glaucoma classification revealed improved performance in free-form test-time adaptation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts source models in clinical scenarios with random and fragmented data, advancing TTA methodologies for medical applications.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

### [105] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGDNet, a Zero-Shot method for enhancing underexposed images without paired datasets, outperforming existing unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods often face challenges in collecting paired datasets of underexposed and well-illuminated images and risk over-enhancing regions. This paper aims to simplify this process and improve results.

Method: The proposed IGDNet uses a single test image for enhancement with a framework comprising a decomposition module and denoising module to separate illumination from reflection and refine the image iteratively.

Result: IGDNet significantly enhances image quality on public datasets under diverse lighting conditions, achieving better PSNR and SSIM scores than 14 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: IGDNet effectively addresses challenges in enhancing underexposed images without requiring training data or priors, demonstrating robust generalization and noise suppression.

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

### [106] [Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning with Quantity Prompts for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02454)
*Weiwei Duan,Luping Ji,Shengjia Chen,Sicheng Zhu,Jianghong Huang,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) approach targeting the detection of moving infrared small targets in a low-annotation environment, surpassing many fully-supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for moving infrared small target detection depend heavily on full supervision with detailed manual annotations, which is both expensive and time-consuming, especially with low-quality data. The study seeks to explore weakly-supervised alternatives to reduce annotation requirements.

Method: WeCoL uses a pretrained segment anything model (SAM) for target mining by integrating target activation maps and multi-frame energy accumulation. It employs contrastive learning to refine pseudo-label reliability by assessing positive/negative sample similarity and incorporates long-short term motion-aware learning to capture local-global motion patterns.

Result: Experiments on DAUB and ITSDT-15K datasets demonstrate that WeCoL often outperforms earlier fully-supervised methods, achieving over 90% of the performance of state-of-the-art fully-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: WeCoL establishes a promising weakly-supervised framework for detecting small moving targets in infrared imagery, presenting an effective alternative that reduces annotation demands while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh Silksong introduces a novel compact mesh representation that uses unique vertex tokenization to reduce redundancy and improve mesh generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mesh tokenization methods create repeated vertex tokens leading to inefficiencies and wasted computational resources.

Method: The authors design a new tokenization approach that accesses each vertex only once, reducing redundancy by 50%, and achieving a high compression rate of approximately 22%.

Result: Experimental results highlight the model’s ability to generate meshes with superior geometric integrity, including manifold topology, watertight detection, and consistent face normals.

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong efficiently generates high-quality meshes with reduced redundancy and enhanced geometric properties, making it well-suited for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

### [108] [From Long Videos to Engaging Clips: A Human-Inspired Video Editing Framework with Multimodal Narrative Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02790)
*Xiangfeng Wang,Xiao Li,Yadong Wei,Xueyu Song,Yang Song,Xiaoqiang Xia,Fangrui Zeng,Zaiyi Chen,Liu Liu,Gu Xu,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIVE, a multimodal framework for automatic video editing, which outperforms existing methods by focusing on narrative understanding and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient video editing solutions has increased due to the growing volume of online video content, particularly short-form videos. Existing methods fail to fully utilize rich visual context, leading to incoherent edits.

Method: HIVE uses multimodal narrative understanding via large language models to analyze videos. It includes techniques like character extraction, dialogue analysis, narrative summarization, scene segmentation, highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and content pruning.

Result: HIVE surpasses existing baselines in both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks. The team also created DramaAD, a new dataset with over 800 drama episodes and 500 edited ad clips.

Conclusion: The HIVE framework significantly bridges the gap between automatic and human-edited video quality, addressing previous shortcomings in video coherence and content curation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

*Teng Fu,Yuwen Chen,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "CrowdTrack," a large-scale multi-pedestrian tracking dataset designed for challenging real-life scenarios, primarily from first-person views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing multi-object tracking (MOT) datasets, which often feature simple scenes and lack realism, thus making it difficult to train effective algorithms for complex scenarios.

Method: The authors created a dataset called CrowdTrack, which includes 33 videos with over 5,000 annotated trajectories. These videos were captured from real-world first-person perspectives in complex environments, and every object is annotated with bounding boxes and unique IDs.

Result: The dataset showcases comprehensive annotations and highlights its value by testing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and foundation models on it, providing a benchmark for performance evaluation.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack will serve as a valuable resource to develop and evaluate robust multi-pedestrian tracking algorithms in realistic and complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedFormer, a new medical vision transformer designed to address the inefficiencies and limitations of current task-specific and computationally costly models. It incorporates a pyramid scaling structure and Dual Sparse Selection Attention for robust and efficient medical image recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision transformers often lack generality, have high computational demands, and include handcrafted sparse attention, which may compromise performance.

Method: The authors propose MedFormer, which uses a pyramid scaling backbone for hierarchical feature representation and introduces Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) to enhance efficiency and content focus.

Result: MedFormer demonstrates superior performance across tasks like classification, semantic segmentation, and lesion detection on diverse medical image datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MedFormer achieves better generality, high efficiency, and competitive accuracy, making it a robust solution for various medical image recognition tasks.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

*Luca Parolari,Andrea Cherubini,Lamberto Ballan,Carlo Biffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a temporally-aware supervised learning approach for polyp counting in colonoscopy, achieving a 2.2x reduction in tracklet fragmentation compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy by automating polyp counting, aiming to improve procedure reporting and quality control.

Method: The approach includes supervised contrastive loss with temporally-aware soft targets for robust clustering and temporal adjacency constraints to reduce false positive tracklet re-associations.

Result: The methodology improves fragmentation rate 2.2x compared with previous methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating temporal awareness.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is crucial in polyp counting for colonoscopy, marking a breakthrough in procedure automation and quality control.

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

*Ziqi Miao,Yi Ding,Lijun Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called VisCo Attack to exploit vulnerabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using visually grounded jailbreak scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing security vulnerabilities observed in MLLMs, particularly through harmful textual data embedded in visual inputs, which pose challenges for real-world deployment.

Method: The authors propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack, which creates visual-centric jailbreak contexts using four strategies. It dynamically generates auxiliary images, refines semantics, and obfuscates toxicity to craft prompts that induce harmful behavior in MLLMs effectively.

Result: The VisCo Attack achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on a benchmark against GPT-4o, surpassing the baseline's 2.48 toxicity score and 22.2% ASR.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the critical vulnerability posed by visual-centric jailbreak attacks in MLLMs. The VisCo Attack offers a realistic method to evaluate and address these vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for improved security measures.

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

*Hyunsoo Son,Jeonghyun Noh,Suemin Jeon,Chaoli Wang,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-INR is a new framework for scientific data encoding that addresses limitations of existing INR-based methods by using meta-learning, clustering, and dynamic re-clustering mechanisms to process multivariate data on unstructured grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR methods are limited in representing complex structures, handling multivariate data, and working on unstructured grids, leading to poor performance on real-world datasets.

Method: MC-INR employs meta-learning, clustering for flexible representation, residual-based dynamic re-clustering for adaptive partitioning, and a branched layer to simultaneously process multivariate data.

Result: Experiments show MC-INR achieves superior performance compared to current methods in scientific data encoding tasks.

Conclusion: MC-INR enables more efficient and flexible encoding of multivariate data on unstructured grids, advancing the capability of INR techniques for complex datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large public datasets addressing pedestrian detection in low-light conditions motivates a novel approach to enhance RGB detection capabilities.

Method: The pipeline involves three steps: 1) using fine-tuned infrared models for pedestrian detection, 2) transferring infrared-generated labels to RGB images, and 3) training RGB object detection models using these transferred labels.

Result: Evaluation using KAIST dataset indicated that models trained on generated labels surpassed those trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for mAP@50 and mAP@50-95 metrics.

Conclusion: The infrared-based labeling significantly boosts the performance of low-light RGB pedestrian detection models, showcasing a promising approach for improving pedestrian safety technology.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and

Result: The model achieved 99% accuracy, outperforming current methods by a 7% margin while covering more crops and diseases.

Conclusion: The proposed solution improves agricultural disease detection in India, benefiting farmers by enhancing accuracy and expanding coverage.

Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and

outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize and automate genetic selection tasks in aquaculture by addressing challenges in shrimp morphological analysis using RGBD images.

Method: The system uses a modified ResNet-50 for view classification and rostrum integrity determination, a VitPose-based pose estimation module for identifying 23 skeletal keypoints, and an SVM model for converting pixel data to centimeter measurements.

Result: IMASHRIMP achieves 97.94% mean average precision in pose estimation and reduces human errors in classification and detection to as low as 0% and 3.64%, respectively, with a pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of just 0.07 cm.

Conclusion: The system automates and accelerates shrimp morphological analysis, contributing to improved genetic selection efficiency and sustainable aquaculture practices.

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to
more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at

*Ruicheng Wang,Sicheng Xu,Yue Dong,Yu Deng,Jianfeng Xiang,Zelong Lv,Guangzhong Sun,Xin Tong,Jiaolong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGe-2 is a state-of-the-art model that predicts 3D metric-scale geometry from a single image, outperforming previous methods in accuracy and detail recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance mono-image 3D geometry estimation by addressing the limitations in metric-scale prediction and fine-grained detail recovery in real data.

Method: Built upon MoGe, MoGe-2 introduces strategies for accurate metric-scale geometry prediction and a data refinement approach using synthetic labels to handle noise and errors in real datasets.

Result: MoGe-2 outperforms previous models by achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scales, and detailed 3D reconstruction in a single framework.

Conclusion: The proposed MoGe-2 model tackles challenges in monocular geometry estimation, setting a new standard for performance and detail recovery in this domain.

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

*Buzhen Huang,Chen Li,Chongyang Xu,Dongyue Lu,Jinnan Chen,Yangang Wang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in human pose estimation for close interactions in complex videos using a dual-branch system informed by appearance cues, social proxemics, and physical laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human pose estimation methods struggle with accurately reconstructing close interactions due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions. This limitation persists even with state-of-the-art models like SAM.

Method: The authors propose a dual-branch optimization framework that incorporates a diffusion model for learning human proxemics and pose prior knowledge, supplemented with constraints (3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, mesh penetration).

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in benchmarking experiments and can reliably estimate interactive motions in complex environments. A new dataset with pseudo ground-truth interaction annotations is introduced to support the community.

Conclusion: Using human appearance cues combined with proxemics and physical constraints enhances human pose estimation in challenging conditions. The method is effective and contributes new resources for ongoing research.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

*Alina F. Dima,Suprosanna Shit,Huaqi Qiu,Robbie Holland,Tamara T. Mueller,Fabio Antonio Musio,Kaiyuan Yang,Bjoern Menze,Rickmer Braren,Marcus Makowski,Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework that integrates voxelization, meshes, and parametric models of vessels through differentiable transformations, enabling automatic extraction of smooth vessel shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel representations like voxelization, meshes, and parametric models are used separately and require ground-truth parameters for shape extraction.

Method: The framework utilizes differentiable voxelization to infer vessel shape parameters as centerlines and radii represented by cubic B-splines, enabling smooth and continuous geometry.

Result: Experiments on vessels such as aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels show accurate volumetric fitting and generation of high-fidelity meshes.

Conclusion: The proposed method unifies multiple vessel representations and streamlines parametric modeling, enhancing geometric accuracy and post-processing capabilities.

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

*Tan Pan,Zhaorui Tan,Kaiyu Guo,Dongli Xu,Weidi Xu,Chen Jiang,Xin Guo,Yuan Qi,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised learning framework, $S^2DC$, for 3D medical images to address anatomical structure variations by enforcing semantic discrepancy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis requires handling structural variations such as location, scale, and morphology, but current self-supervised learning methods fail to account for these factors, leading to limitations.

Method: The $S^2DC$ framework enforces semantic discrepancy for different structures using optimal transport and ensures structural-level semantic consistency with neighborhood similarity distribution.

Result: $S^2DC$ shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3 modalities in medical image self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: $S^2DC$ successfully captures structure-aware representations for 3D medical images, overcoming key limitations of prior methods and advancing mSSL performance.

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

*Weili Xu,Enxin Song,Wenhao Chai,Xuexiang Wen,Tian Ye,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuroraLong uses a linear RNN language model instead of transformer-based LLMs to understand long videos efficiently, significantly reducing computational and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is computationally and memory-intensive due to the quadratic scaling of transformer-based LLMs with input sequence length.

Method: AuroraLong replaces transformer-based LLMs with linear RNN language models featuring constant-size hidden states and applies visual token reordering to further boost efficiency.

Result: AuroraLong, with only 2B parameters trained on public data, achieves comparable performance to private-data-trained Transformer models on various video benchmarks.

Conclusion: AuroraLong highlights the potential of linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by reducing computational barriers while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) in space missions due to sensor faults by developing a simulation framework to generate faulty image datasets for AI-based fault detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliability and robustness of VBN algorithms in space missions while addressing the lack of datasets containing faulty image data.

Method: A simulation framework is designed to recreate faulty camera sensor conditions, systematically injecting faults in synthetically generated images to develop a representative dataset.

Result: The study presents a detailed analysis of potential faults in camera sensors and their impacts on navigation performance, offering a dataset for testing AI fault detection algorithms.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundational dataset to enhance the reliability of AI-based fault detection systems in Vision-Based Navigation for space missions, addressing a critical gap in this domain.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-generated content misuse has raised public security concerns. The paper introduces Holmes-Set, a dataset for AIGI detection with human-verifiable explanations, and proposes the Holmes Pipeline for enhanced generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in AI-generated image misuse highlights a need for robust detection methods that can provide human-understandable and generalized explanations.

Method: The paper develops Holmes-Set with two sub-sets (Holmes-SFTSet and Holmes-DPOSet) and employs the Holmes Pipeline for model training through visual expert pre-training, fine-tuning, and preference optimization.

Result: The model, AIGI-Holmes, demonstrated strong performance and generalization on three benchmarks while producing human-verifiable explanations.

Conclusion: Holmes-Set and Pipeline provide effective tools for addressing challenges in AIGI detection, including better explanations and generalization.

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

*Charlesquin Kemajou Mbakam,Jonathan Spence,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach combining deep unfolding and model distillation to improve Diffusion Models for image posterior sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using Diffusion Models for Bayesian computational imaging either lack flexibility or require supervised training for specific tasks. A method is needed to balance accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.

Method: The authors propose unfolding the LATINO Langevin MCMC algorithm into a deep learning framework and applying model distillation to accelerate inference.

Result: The unfolded and distilled samplers outperform state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and computational efficiency while maintaining adaptability to changes in the imaging forward model.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates how combining advanced sampling algorithms with deep learning can improve computational imaging while offering both precision and adaptability.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Personalized Training (APT) to address challenges like overfitting and semantic degradation in personalized diffusion models using limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the personalization of diffusion models with limited reference data while combating issues such as overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of text alignment.

Method: APT combines three components: Adaptive Training Adjustment to combat overfitting using indicators with data augmentations and loss weighting, Representation Stabilization to regularize features, and Attention Alignment to maintain prior knowledge through cross-attention map alignment.

Result: Experiments show that APT reduces overfitting, retains prior knowledge, and performs better than existing methods in creating diverse, high-quality images.

Conclusion: APT effectively addresses the limitations of personalized diffusion models trained on scarce data, enhancing both image fidelity and diversity while maintaining semantic coherence.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

*Xiangyang Luo,Ye Zhu,Yunfei Liu,Lijian Lin,Cong Wan,Zijian Cai,Shao-Lun Huang,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CanonSwap, a framework for video face swapping that focuses on decoupling motion and appearance information to achieve better dynamic attribute preservation and identity transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face-swapping methods struggle to preserve the dynamic attributes of the target face while transferring the source identity, due to the coupling of facial appearance and motion.

Method: CanonSwap decouples motion and appearance information using a process where motion-related data is removed for identity modification within a canonical space. The swapped identity is then reintroduced with a Partial Identity Modulation module that integrates source features with a spatial mask for facial regions.

Result: The method shows improved performance in terms of visual quality, temporal consistency, and identity preservation compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: CanonSwap effectively overcomes limitations of existing methods by preserving dynamic attributes and transferring identity more precisely in video face swapping.

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIU3R, an alignment-free framework for simultaneous 3D reconstruction and understanding from unposed images while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of recent 2D-to-3D feature alignment approaches, such as restricted 3D understanding and semantic loss, for simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction.

Method: The authors propose the SIU3R framework using pixel-aligned 3D representation and unified learnable queries for 3D understanding without 2D alignment. They also analyze cross-task benefits and design two lightweight modules for shared representation interaction.

Result: SIU3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in three areas: 3D reconstruction, understanding, and simultaneous execution of both. It showcases the benefits of the alignment-free framework and task collaboration design.

Conclusion: The alignment-free SIU3R framework effectively integrates 3D reconstruction and understanding tasks, offering enhanced capability, native 3D understanding, and superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address difficulties in generating non-rigid human and animal images, particularly in cases with multiple overlapping subjects, due to limitations of existing methods and insufficient datasets.

Method: It introduces the DiT-based UniMC framework that integrates instance- and keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, and builds the HAIG-2.9M dataset with multi-class images and extensive annotations for more accurate generation.

Result: Experiments show UniMC generates high-quality, controllable images of both humans and animals even under occlusion and in multi-class scenarios, highlighting HAIG-2.9M’s effectiveness.

Conclusion: UniMC and HAIG-2.9M provide a unified solution for controllable text-to-image generation of humans and animals, pushing advancements in handling occlusions and diverse conditions.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

*Yuxuan Wang,Tianwei Cao,Huayu Zhang,Zhongjiang He,Kongming Liang,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairHuman, a fine-tuning method aimed at improving global and local quality in human image generation, specifically focusing on faces and hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from existing challenges in generating detailed human images, particularly faces and hands, using diffusion-based text-to-image models.

Method: FairHuman employs a multi-objective fine-tuning approach with three learning objectives: global diffusion-based optimization and local face/hands objectives using positional priors. It applies the Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion for parameter updates, ensuring fairness in optimization.

Result: The method demonstrates improved generation of intricate local details while preserving overall image quality, validated via extensive experiments across various scenarios.

Conclusion: FairHuman effectively elevates human image generation fidelity, successfully addressing local detail inaccuracies in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image

*Mélanie Gaillochet,Mehrdad Noori,Sahar Dastani,Christian Desrosiers,Hervé Lombaert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a weakly supervised segmentation framework using bounding box annotations to automate prompt generation for vision foundation models. It achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise annotations in the medical field are time-consuming and expensive, stimulating the need for alternative approaches such as weakly supervised methods using bounding box annotations.

Method: The framework combines foundation model capabilities with weakly supervised segmentation. Using bounding box annotations, it automates prompt generation and employs optimization schemes integrating box constraints with pseudo-labels.

Result: The method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data setting, surpassing both fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods in multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: Weakly supervised approaches can effectively harness vision foundation models to reduce annotation effort while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, opening new avenues for efficient medical image processing.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

*Alex Colagrande,Paul Caillon,Eva Feillet,Alexandre Allauzen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), a computationally efficient framework addressing the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers by employing a multiscale attention mechanism inspired by $n$-body simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers have quadratic complexity with respect to input length, limiting their practicality for high-resolution tasks.

Method: MANO uses a distance-based multiscale attention mechanism inspired by $n$-body numerical simulations, achieving global receptive fields while maintaining linear time and memory complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that MANO matches the performance of leading models like ViT and Swin Transformer in tasks like image classification and Darcy flows, while substantially saving runtime and memory usage.

Conclusion: MANO is a promising alternative to standard Transformers, combining performance consistency with significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

### [132] [Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02751)
*Mingxin Liu,Peiyuan Zhang,Yuan Liu,Wei Zhang,Yue Zhou,Ning Liao,Ziyang Gong,Junwei Luo,Zhirui Wang,Yi Yu,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework that reduces annotation costs while achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and inefficiency of dataset annotations in oriented object detection (OOD) motivate the development of an approach that effectively balances annotation cost and model performance.

Method: The authors propose the PWOOD framework, incorporating three key components: (1) utilization of partially weak annotations, (2) an Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (OS-Student) model to efficiently learn key information, and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF) for dynamic thresholding.

Result: Experiments conducted on multiple datasets (DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR) show that the PWOOD framework outperforms traditional weakly supervised algorithms and rivals semi-supervised algorithms in performance.

Conclusion: The PWOOD framework offers a cost-efficient solution for OOD, achieving high performance while reducing dependency on detailed annotations, making it practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

*Danrong Zhang,Huili Huang,N. Simrill Smith,Nimisha Roy,J. David Frost*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a semantic segmentation approach to objectively assess building damage severity using social media images post-earthquake, leveraging a new scoring system and a fine-tuned SegFormer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classification methods for damage assessment in social media images post-earthquake are subjective and insufficient for capturing varying extents of damage within images.

Method: A new segmented damage severity dataset was created, fine-tuned using a SegFormer model, and paired with a scoring system that also integrates depth estimation.

Result: The method successfully segments damage into undamaged structures, damaged structures, and debris, enabling a nuanced understanding for disaster assessment.

Conclusion: The approach improves objectivity in damage assessment, aiding disaster teams in making precise and effective response decisions during earthquake aftermaths.

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

*Liheng Zhang,Lexi Pang,Hang Ye,Xiaoxuan Ma,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances text-to-image diffusion models by introducing a flexible feature injection framework for improved structural and appearance control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome issues like structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts in existing feature injection methods for text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: Proposes decoupling the injection timestep from the denoising process via a structure-rich injection module, along with appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot conditioning scenarios, improving structural and appearance fidelity in the generated images.

Conclusion: A training-free framework is presented that significantly improves structural alignment and appearance quality in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

*Miguel Espinosa,Chenhongyi Yang,Linus Ericsson,Steven McDonagh,Elliot J. Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that reduces the burden of manual visual prompts in image segmentation using reference images and semantic priors from foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of manual visual prompts still being required in the SAM model for image segmentation despite alleviating the need for large-scale annotated data.

Method: The proposed approach uses a multi-stage training-free method combining (1) memory bank construction, (2) representation aggregation, and (3) semantic-aware feature matching to automatically segment objects in images using a small set of reference images.

Result: Significant metric improvements were observed, achieving state-of-the-art results on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50), and outperforming competitors on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces manual effort in segmentation task setup and enhances performance, showcasing the potential of semantic priors for automatic mask generation.

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

*Gent Serifi,Marcel C. Bühler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyperGaussians, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for generating high-quality animatable face avatars from videos, outperforming existing methods in realism and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in creating realistic, animatable 3D face avatars from monocular videos, which are crucial for applications in augmented and virtual reality. Existing methods struggle with nonlinear deformations, fine details, and lighting.

Method: The proposed method extends 3D Gaussian primitives to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, called HyperGaussians. It introduces a computational improvement through an 'inverse covariance trick,' making the approach efficient and compatible with existing models like FlashAvatar.

Result: HyperGaussians significantly outperform 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in both numerical and visual evaluations, excelling in capturing high-frequency details such as eyeglass frames, teeth, and specular reflections across 19 subjects and 4 datasets.

Conclusion: HyperGaussians address the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting for animatable face avatars, offering a more expressive, efficient, and high-quality solution suitable for various real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

*Fangfu Liu,Hao Li,Jiawei Chi,Hanyang Wang,Minghui Yang,Fudong Wang,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangScene-X introduces a generative approach for recovering 3D structures using sparse 2D views, solving limitations in existing dense-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction and scene understanding rely on heavily calibrated dense views, leading to subpar semantic synthesis and rendering artifacts with limited perspectives.

Method: LangScene-X is powered by a TriMap video diffusion model for generating multi-modal outputs from sparse views, paired with a Language Quantized Compressor for encoding language embeddings without per-scene retraining.

Result: Experimental results on real-world data validate LangScene-X's superior quality and cross-scene generalization capabilities over existing methods.

Conclusion: LangScene-X successfully advances open-vocabulary scene understanding and 3D reconstruction with sparse input views, proving its applicability for broad and diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

TL;DR: This paper proposes DCDP-HAR, a framework for improving multimodal Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via advanced feature extraction, contrastive learning, and gradient modulation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal HAR systems face challenges such as difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality contributions, necessitating solutions for better efficiency and stability.

Method: The framework employs a dual-path architecture using ResNet and DenseNet, introduces contrastive learning for feature alignment, and uses gradient modulation and accumulation strategies to mitigate modality competition.

Result: Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the components, and comparative experiments demonstrate the framework's performance across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DCDP-HAR enhances multimodal HAR capability by resolving key challenges related to feature alignment and modality balance, contributing to intelligent system development.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive approach to improve human activity recognition (HAR) using multi-attention mechanisms combined with unsupervised data augmentation and adaptive loss strategies, achieving high accuracy across datasets and feasibility on embedded devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in HAR, such as limited labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient high-level feature extraction, and suboptimal performance on lightweight devices.

Method: The method employs unsupervised, statistics-guided data augmentation to balance classes, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network with attention mechanisms for feature extraction, and an adaptive multi-loss fusion strategy for model optimization.

Result: The approach achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% on WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY datasets respectively, showing significant improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed USAD framework not only improves HAR accuracy but also demonstrates practicality and efficiency for deployment on embedded devices.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: AnyI2V is a novel training-free framework enabling spatial and motion-controlled video generation from diverse conditional inputs, including meshes, point clouds, and mixed formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in achieving precise control over spatial layout and motion dynamics in text-to-video and image-to-video synthesis motivated the development of this framework.

Method: AnyI2V leverages user-defined motion trajectories and supports heterogeneous conditional inputs without requiring extensive training, thus enabling flexible video generation.

Result: Experimental results highlight AnyI2V's superior performance, versatility in handling diverse inputs, and ability to execute style transfer and nuanced edits.

Conclusion: AnyI2V provides an innovative solution for dynamic and spatially controlled video generation, marking progress in flexibility and reducing computational costs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper identifies the adaptation challenge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specialized vision tasks like chart understanding due to dataset mismatches. It proposes a method called Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to address reasoning errors and improve performance in data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt MLLMs to specialized vision tasks like chart and table understanding without relying on large-scale dataset retraining.

Method: The authors introduce Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a technique that uses bounding box grounding to enhance reasoning accuracy in Chain-of-Thought reasoning data, addressing factual errors from pre-trained data.

Result: The proposed GCoT approach significantly improved performance in five specialized vision tasks under data-limited conditions, when compared to traditional fine-tuning and distillation methods.

Conclusion: Grounded Chain-of-Thought provides a practical and effective solution for adapting MLLMs to specialized tasks in limited data regimes by incorporating grounding information into reasoning steps, demonstrating its versatility across various visual formats.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models face adoption barriers due to high computational costs and slow inference speeds. These issues hinder their real-world application potential.

Method: EasyCache utilizes a runtime-adaptive caching mechanism to reuse transformation vectors during inference, avoiding redundant computations. It does not require offline profiling or parameter tuning.

Result: EasyCache improves inference speed by 2.1-3.3× compared to baseline methods and achieves up to 36% better visual fidelity measured through PSNR.

Conclusion: EasyCache is an efficient, training-free solution enhancing accessibility and usability of video diffusion models for both research and real-world applications.

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

### [144] [RefTok: Reference-Based Tokenization for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02862)
*Xiang Fan,Xiaohang Sun,Kushan Thakkar,Zhu Liu,Vimal Bhat,Ranjay Krishna,Xiang Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method for video modeling, which improves temporal dynamics handling and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling temporal redundancy in video models is a challenging task, as current methods struggle to effectively capture temporal dependencies and redundancies in videos.

Method: The paper proposes RefTok, a tokenization method that encodes and decodes frame sets conditioned on an unquantized reference frame, ensuring preserved motion continuity and object appearances.

Result: RefTok significantly improves metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by 36.7% across datasets and achieves better video generation compared to state-of-the-art tokenizers, including models with larger parameters.

Conclusion: Using RefTok enhances efficiency in learning temporal video dynamics, delivering superior performance in terms of both video reconstruction and generation, advancing the state-of-the-art in video modeling.

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

### [145] [Point3R: Streaming 3D Reconstruction with Explicit Spatial Pointer Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02863)
*Yuqi Wu,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Point3R, an online framework for dense 3D reconstruction using a novel explicit spatial pointer memory approach, mitigating issues tied to implicit memory limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense 3D scene reconstruction methods using implicit memory face issues like capacity limitations and the loss of earlier frame information, motivating the need for a more efficient and robust framework.

Method: Point3R employs an explicit spatial pointer memory system where each pointer corresponds to a specific 3D position. The method uses 3D hierarchical position embeddings for interaction and a fusion mechanism for maintaining uniform memory, enabling efficient integration of new observations.

Result: Point3R delivers either competitive or state-of-the-art performance across different tasks while maintaining low training costs.

Conclusion: Point3R provides an effective solution for dense streaming 3D reconstruction, outperforming many existing methods with better memory management, making it a valuable tool in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

### [147] [Signalling Health for Improved Kubernetes Microservice Availability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02158)
*Jacob Roberts,Blair Archibald,Phil Trinder*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study focuses on Signal-based Container Monitoring (SCM) as an alternative to Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM) in Kubernetes. SCM detects container health changes faster and avoids erroneous failure detections, offering improved service availability without the need for tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve container monitoring methods for microservices to enhance service availability and reduce the response time when failures occur.

Method: The authors designed, implemented, and evaluated SCM for Kubernetes using empirical analysis and mathematical modeling, and benchmarked its performance against PCM using the SockShop benchmark across six experiments.

Result: SCM detects container failure 86% faster than PCM with comparable resource overhead. PCM's tuning and erroneous failure detection can reduce service availability by 4%.

Conclusion: SCM offers significant advantages over PCM by providing faster and more reliable failure detection without the need for manual tuning, and should be integrated into modern orchestrators.

Abstract: Microservices are often deployed and managed by a container orchestrator that
can detect and fix failures to maintain the service availability critical in
many applications. In Poll-based Container Monitoring (PCM), the orchestrator
periodically checks container health. While a common approach, PCM requires
careful tuning, may degrade service availability, and can be slow to detect
container health changes. An alternative is Signal-based Container Monitoring
(SCM), where the container signals the orchestrator when its status changes. We
present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for
Kubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by
a new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM
over six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that
polling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\% faster than
PCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource
overheads. We find PCM can erroneously detect failures, and this reduces
service availability by 4\%. We propose that orchestrators offer SCM features
for faster failure detection than PCM without erroneous detections or careful
tuning.

*Bruce Fang,Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transfer learning-based algorithm for fault root cause identification in cloud computing, achieving improved accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address difficulties in identifying fault root causes due to system complexity, dense service interactions, and limited fault information in cloud environments.

Method: An intelligent transfer learning algorithm is proposed, which uses a shared feature extraction module, domain adversarial mechanism, and pseudo-label selection strategy for effective knowledge transfer and handling of scarce labeled data.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the method outperforms existing techniques in accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC, even under label scarcity, class imbalance, and heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates robust performance and practical applicability in complex cloud computing scenarios, validating its effectiveness for fault identification tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fault root cause identification in
cloud computing environments. The difficulty arises from complex system
structures, dense service coupling, and limited fault information. To solve
this problem, an intelligent identification algorithm based on transfer
learning is proposed. The method introduces a shared feature extraction module
and a domain adversarial mechanism to enable effective knowledge transfer from
the source domain to the target domain. This improves the model's
discriminative ability and generalization performance in the target domain. The
model incorporates a pseudo-label selection strategy. When labeled samples are
lacking in the target domain, high-confidence predictions are used in training.
This enhances the model's ability to recognize minority classes. To evaluate
the stability and adaptability of the method in real-world scenarios,
experiments are designed under three conditions: label scarcity, class
imbalance, and heterogeneous node environments. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in several key
metrics, including accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. The model demonstrates stronger
discriminative power and robustness. Notably, under extreme class imbalance and
significant structural differences in the target domain, the model still
maintains high performance. This validates the effectiveness and practical
value of the proposed mechanisms in complex cloud computing systems.

*Roopkatha Banerjee,Prince Modi,Jinal Vyas,Chunduru Sri Abhijit,Tejus Chandrashekar,Harsha Varun Marisetty,Manik Gupta,Yogesh Simmhan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces Flotilla, a lightweight and scalable federated learning framework optimized for real distributed systems and systems research, outperforming existing frameworks like Flower, OpenFL, and FedML in terms of scalability and fault tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current FL frameworks, which mainly simulate distributed systems and lack robust support for asynchronous aggregation and failure resilience, thereby hindering their applicability for real-world distributed deployment and systems research.

Method: The authors propose Flotilla, a modular FL framework with a design that supports both synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies. It features stateless clients, session state separation, and periodic/incremental checkpointing to improve resilience and efficiency.

Result: The framework supports five FL strategies on various DNN models, demonstrates rapid failover on 200+ clients, shows comparable or better resource usage compared to other frameworks, and scales significantly better for over 1000 clients.

Conclusion: Flotilla establishes itself as a competitive FL framework for exploring novel FL strategies, facilitating real-world deployments, enabling systems research, and offering superior scalability and fault tolerance.

Abstract: With the recent improvements in mobile and edge computing and rising concerns
of data privacy, Federated Learning(FL) has rapidly gained popularity as a
privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning methodology. Several FL
frameworks have been built for testing novel FL strategies. However, most focus
on validating the learning aspects of FL through pseudo-distributed simulation
but not for deploying on real edge hardware in a distributed manner to
meaningfully evaluate the federated aspects from a systems perspective. Current
frameworks are also inherently not designed to support asynchronous
aggregation, which is gaining popularity, and have limited resilience to client
and server failures. We introduce Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight FL
framework. It adopts a ``user-first'' modular design to help rapidly compose
various synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies while being agnostic to the
DNN architecture. It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates
out the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We
demonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL
strategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and
server-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to
rapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource
usage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or
better than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML. It
also scales significantly better compared to Flower for 1000+ clients. This
positions Flotilla as a competitive candidate to build novel FL strategies on,
compare them uniformly, rapidly deploy them, and perform systems research and
optimizations.

tenant-specific and platform-specific services, tailored to diverse scientific
requirements.
  Alps incorporates heterogeneous hardware, including CPUs and GPUs,
interconnected by a high-performance Slingshot network, and offers a modular
storage system. A key innovation is the versatile software-defined cluster
(vCluster) technology, which bridges cloud and HPC paradigms. By abstracting
infrastructure, service management, and user environments into distinct layers,
vClusters allow for customized platforms that support diverse workloads.
Current platforms on Alps serve various scientific domains, including numerical

*Xing Liu,Lizhuo Luo,Ming Tang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes FlowSpec, a specialized framework aimed at efficient distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It addresses latency issues in sparse network inference requests using pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge, especially when the inference request is sparse, as existing pipeline-based approaches are underutilized in such cases.

Method: FlowSpec introduces three mechanisms: score-based step-wise verification, efficient draft management, and dynamic draft expansion strategies. These aim to enhance pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency.

Result: FlowSpec achieves substantial improvements in inference speed with speedup ratios between 1.36× and 1.77× compared to other baseline methods on real-world testbeds.

Conclusion: FlowSpec is shown to optimize distributed LLM inference at the edge, improving both the speed and efficiency of the process, thus addressing challenges in pipeline utilization during sparse inference requests.

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LDSolver, a machine learning-based framework for fluid flow simulation that works efficiently on coarse spatiotemporal grids while maintaining accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluid simulations are computationally expensive with classical solvers requiring fine grids, while existing machine learning methods have issues with interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency.

Method: The proposed LDSolver combines a differentiable finite volume solver and a learnable module for flux approximation and temporal error correction on coarse grids.

Result: Experiments on various flow systems demonstrate that LDSolver outperforms traditional models, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal training data.

Conclusion: LDSolver enables efficient and accurate fluid flow simulations with superior speed and generalizability on coarse grids, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel model, DKGCM, to improve traffic demand forecasting by addressing spatiotemporal complexities using methods like DTW, clustering, and FFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance transportation resource allocation by developing a model that more accurately predicts traffic demand, overcoming limitations in modeling spatiotemporal relationships.

Method: The method involves creating a new graph convolutional network (DKGCM) using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), K-means clustering for spatial dependencies, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for temporal dependencies, and reinforcement learning for training optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model achieves superior performance compared to existing methods across three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance spatial and temporal dependency capturing, leading to significantly better traffic forecasting, which can improve resource utilization in transportation systems.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

TL;DR: The paper investigates multimodal approaches combining text, images, and social features for misinformation detection in tweets during crises like COVID-19 and elections, demonstrating improved performance over unimodal or bimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the surge of social media misinformation during elections and crises, there is a need to develop robust detection methods. Current studies largely focus on unimodal data (text or image), leaving room to explore the potential combination of different modalities.

Method: The study uses early fusion approaches, integrating multimodal features (text, images, and social features) to build and train misinformation classification models. Data enrichment processes like object detection and OCR are applied to collected tweets, followed by analyses of dissemination patterns.

Result: Combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods improved classification accuracy by 15% compared to unimodal approaches and 5% compared to bimodal models. Propagation characteristics of misinformation and patterns of users were also analyzed.

Conclusion: Multimodal detection methods offer enhanced performance and actionable insights into misinformation propagation, proving superior to traditional unimodal and bimodal approaches.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of cross-subject motor imagery classification by enhancing preprocessing and CNN training techniques, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark EEG datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome significant inter-subject variability in EEG patterns, which hinders the development of calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications.

Method: A novel deep learning approach combining optimized Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) preprocessing, STFT parameter tuning, and a balanced batching strategy during Convolutional Neural Network training is proposed and validated across multiple datasets.

Result: The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracies: 67.60% on BCI Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset IV-2A, and 80.22% on Dataset IV-2B.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new benchmark for cross-subject motor imagery classification and contributes a robust open-access dataset to advance BCI research.

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

*Hexiang Bai,Deyu Li,Jiye Liang,Yanhui Zhai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new feature selection method for massive data using sampling and rough set theory, focusing on maintaining discriminatory ability while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational challenges of feature selection in intelligent systems when dealing with massive data, ensuring efficient processing on limited computing resources.

Method: A feature selection method was developed using the ratio of discernible object pairs as a measure of discriminatory ability and employing positive region preserved sampling to find feature subsets.

Result: Experiments on 11 datasets demonstrated that the method could identify approximate reducts quickly, preserving high discriminatory ability above the estimated lower bounds, even for large-scale datasets on a personal computer.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency and discriminatory ability, making it suitable for feature selection in massive data while being accessible for use on personal computers.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

*Bappaditya Dey,Daniel Sorensen,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in semiconductor manufacturing by proposing a novel machine learning approach for anomaly detection using time-series data transformed into image-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to tackle the critical challenges in anomaly prediction for semiconductor fabrication, such as data complexity, high dimensionality, class imbalance, data noise, and delayed fault emergence.

Method: The method involves converting multivariate time-series data into image representations using Continuous Wavelet Transform, fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16 model as a classifier, and employing a Siamese network to compare pairs of image embeddings for anomaly detection.

Result: The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in identifying anomalies on a real semiconductor FAB process dataset and proved effective for offline anomaly detection.

Conclusion: This method provides a flexible solution for anomaly detection in process and tool data, capable of working in both supervised and semi-supervised modes, and shows promise for practical applications in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

*Anurag Arnab,Ahmet Iscen,Mathilde Caron,Alireza Fathi,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Temporal Chain of Thought," an inference strategy for video question-answering that iteratively selects relevant frames to improve accuracy, particularly for long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in processing and understanding long video sequences using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which currently struggle with distractions and limited context window capabilities.

Method: The method uses VLMs iteratively to identify the most relevant frames from the video during inference, harnessing computation at inference-time to curate input contexts effectively.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on 4 video question-answering datasets and significantly improves performance for longer videos, outperforming standard inference methods despite smaller context windows.

Conclusion: Temporal Chain of Thought enhances VLM capabilities for long-video question-answering by leveraging iterative frame selection, yielding significant accuracy improvements, especially for extended video durations.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

### [159] [AIRES: Accelerating Out-of-Core GCNs via Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02006)
*Shakya Jayakody,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to speed up out-of-core sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) for graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by addressing data alignment and memory constraints, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address memory constraints and performance bottlenecks in out-of-core SpGEMM computations for GCNs, exacerbated by large graph datasets and limited GPU memory in resource-constrained systems.

Method: AIRES proposes a tiling algorithm for block-wise data alignment in sparse matrices and introduces a three-phase dynamic scheduling strategy with a dual-way data transfer mechanism, leveraging GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage, and host memory.

Result: AIRES achieves significant performance improvement, reducing latency by up to 1.8x compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques in real-world graph processing benchmarks.

Conclusion: AIRES effectively mitigates I/O latency and GPU under-utilization in out-of-core SpGEMM for GCNs, providing a scalable and efficient solution for large graph data processing.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

### [160] [GeoAda: Efficiently Finetune Geometric Diffusion Models with Equivariant Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02085)
*Wanjia Zhao,Jiaqi Han,Siyi Gu,Mingjian Jiang,James Zou,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoAda, an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework for efficient fine-tuning of geometric diffusion models, ensuring geometric consistency and addressing overfitting in controlled generative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric diffusion models perform well in tasks like molecular dynamics but struggle with efficient fine-tuning for diverse downstream tasks with varying geometric controls.

Method: GeoAda is introduced as a framework that employs coupling operators, trainable layers, and decoupling operators, while preserving SE(3)-equivariance, for lightweight and efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models.

Result: GeoAda outperforms traditional fine-tuning baselines in maintaining task accuracy and preventing overfitting or catastrophic forgetting across diverse geometric control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework maintains the geometric biases of pretrained diffusion models and proves to be both flexible and effective across various controlled generative tasks in multiple domains.

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

### [161] [Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear Constrained MDPs with a Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02089)
*Xingtu Liu,Lin F. Yang,Sharan Vaswani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a primal-dual framework for solving constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) that uses a generative model and can incorporate any black-box MDP solver. It provides sample complexity bounds for relaxed and strict feasibility cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for solving CMDPs often lack sample efficiency or scalability, particularly in high-dimensional or complex settings. The paper aims to design a method that is both efficient and flexible, particularly leveraging the capabilities of modern unconstrained MDP solvers.

Method: The authors propose a primal-dual framework that works with any black-box unconstrained MDP solver and analyze its performance using mirror descent value iteration (MDVI). They provide theoretical guarantees for sample complexities under both relaxed and strict feasibility settings.

Result: The framework allows for an efficient solution to CMDPs with near-optimal sample complexity in terms of $d$, $\epsilon$, and $\gamma$, under both relaxed and strict feasibility. For relaxed feasibility, the sample complexity is $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2})$ and for strict feasibility, it is $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2})$.

Conclusion: The framework provides a flexible and sample-efficient solution to CMDPs, scalable to feature-based and tabular settings while achieving near-optimal performance under different feasibility requirements.

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

*Eitan Anzenberg,Arunava Samajpati,Sivasankaran Chandrasekar,Varun Kacholia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks leading LLMs against a domain-specific hiring model, showing the latter performs far better in accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating whether large language models can effectively balance accuracy and fairness in high-stakes hiring scenarios.

Method: The authors evaluated several state-of-the-art LLMs and their proprietary hiring model (Match Score) on predictive accuracy metrics and fairness benchmarks using a dataset of 10,000 candidate-job pairs.

Result: Match Score significantly outperformed LLMs in predictive accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs 0.77) and fairness (race-wise impact ratio 0.957 vs 0.809 or lower).

Conclusion: Domain-specific models with careful bias auditing are essential for fair and accurate hiring outcomes, cautioning against reliance on generic LLMs without safeguards.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

*Sooyeon Kim,Giung Nam,Juho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve constrained text generation quality by iteratively refining language models with self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for constrained text generation encounter challenges when focusing on output distributions unlikely under the base model, particularly due to sparse rewards.

Method: The authors use self-distillation to iteratively refine the base language model, enhancing its alignment with target distributions.

Result: Refinement through self-distillation led to substantial improvements in the quality of generated text under constrained conditions.

Conclusion: Progressive self-distillation helps autoregressive language models better conform to constrained target distributions, enhancing generation outcomes.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

*Alexi Gladstone,Ganesh Nanduru,Md Mofijul Islam,Peixuan Han,Hyeonjeong Ha,Aman Chadha,Yilun Du,Heng Ji,Jundong Li,Tariq Iqbal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) for unsupervised learning of System 2 Thinking, achieving better scalability, generalizability, and performance across modalities without additional supervision or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing System 2 Thinking methods, such as modality or problem specificity and reliance on additional supervision, and to explore if such methods can be generalized through unsupervised learning.

Method: The authors propose Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), which assign energy values to input-prediction pairs. Predictions are made by minimizing energy values via gradient descent. EBTs are trained to verify compatibility between inputs and predictions and tested across discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities.

Result: EBTs demonstrate faster scaling rates (up to 35%) during training, outperform Transformer++ on language tasks with 29% better System 2 Thinking capabilities, and surpass Diffusion Transformers on image denoising with fewer forward passes. EBTs also generalize better and achieve superior downstream performance despite equal or worse pretraining results.

Conclusion: Energy-Based Transformers represent a significant paradigm shift, capable of better scaling and generalizing learning and inference capabilities compared to existing models, showing broad applicability across modalities under unsupervised learning frameworks.

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

### [165] [Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496)
*Vaidehi Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores an online approach to conformal prediction, aiming to optimize both coverage and efficiency in interval prediction tasks over time. They analyze performance in exchangeable versus arbitrary data sequences and propose a deterministic algorithm achieving near-optimal tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop efficient methods for interval prediction that maintain coverage guarantees while reducing interval lengths in an online framework.

Method: The authors introduce deterministic algorithms that are robust to adaptive adversarial settings and explore performance in exchangeable and arbitrary data sequences. They analyze tradeoffs between coverage and efficiency, including Pareto-optimal results.

Result: For exchangeable sequences, intervals achieve near-perfect coverage and optimal length compared to hindsight-fixed intervals. For arbitrary sequences, efficiency comes at a cost: more mistakes than $
αT$. A matching algorithm is proposed for balancing these factors.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a single algorithm cannot simultaneously optimize for both exchangeable and arbitrary sequences. However, algorithms capable of near-optimal tradeoffs across these settings exist, offering strong practical utility.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Result: The framework demonstrates that constrained sampling based on optimization methods can effectively generate useful virtual amp models.

Conclusion: PANAMA provides an efficient method for creating virtual guitar amplifiers, highlighting the utility of active learning in reducing training data requirements.

Abstract: We introduce PANAMA, an active learning framework for the training of

to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

*Shikai Qiu,Lechao Xiao,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Jeffrey Pennington,Atish Agarwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates training dynamics in neural networks, uncovering a universal collapse of loss curves across model sizes when training compute and loss are normalized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying scaling limits and universal patterns in neural network training as model size and training duration increase simultaneously.

Method: Analyzes loss curve collapse by normalizing training compute and loss. Studies phenomena across different architectures, datasets, and learning rate schedules. Proposes a theoretical model to explain the observed dynamics.

Result: Identified a universal collapse (termed supercollapse) of loss curves, especially under learning rate decay, revealing that variations fall below the noise level when models are optimally scaled.

Conclusion: The observed supercollapse provides a practical framework for determining good scaling practices and is driven by power-law structures in neural scaling and SGD noise dynamics.

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for classifying data by leveraging an entropy-based function to find a hyperplane in high-dimensional space, enabling efficient handling of both linear and nonlinear separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges in separating data points using hyperplanes in machine learning, especially for classification tasks that require more complex decision boundaries.

Method: The approach involves optimizing an entropy-based function within a bounded hypercube in N-dimensional space. Additionally, the method extends to allow for polynomial surfaces to address non-linear separability.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robustness and versatility across various classification tasks and is shown to be an efficient alternative to existing optimization techniques like SVMs and gradient descent.

Conclusion: The new methodology provides a robust alternative for classification tasks, effectively handling both linear and non-linear separability and offering a flexible decision boundary generation method.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: CROP introduces an automatic VLSI design flow tuning using a large language model (LLM). It achieves better results in fewer iterations, reducing power consumption by 9.9% in industrial designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual parameter selection in VLSI design is labor-intensive and expert-dependent. Automating the process is crucial to handle the complex and vast solution space of EDA algorithms.

Method: CROP employs a scalable RTL-to-vector transformation methodology, an embedding-based circuit retrieval system, and an LLM-guided parameter search enhanced by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Result: CROP achieves superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations, including a 9.9% power reduction, as shown in experiments with industrial designs.

Conclusion: CROP demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLMs with EDA tools for optimizing VLSI design flow, paving the way for more efficient and automated chip design processes.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges when offline data used in contextual online pricing is biased, which affects the performance of pricing algorithms.

Method: The authors proposed Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) policies and generalized OFU algorithms to achieve minimax-optimal regret bounds, both in scalar and general price elasticity cases. They also developed a robust variant for scenarios where exact bias is unknown.

Result: The paper established instance-dependent and minimax-optimal regret bounds for contextual pricing problems. Results include sub-linear regret and improved performance even in the presence of biased offline data.

Conclusion: These findings provide the first tight regret guarantees for contextual pricing with biased offline data and extend applicability to stochastic linear bandits.

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

*Xiao Li,Liangji Zhu,Anand Rangarajan,Sanjay Ranka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a latent diffusion framework that enhances generative models for better spatiotemporal reconstruction and data compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models, while effective in some tasks, face challenges like limited controllability and reconstruction accuracy, limiting their applicability for data compression.

Method: The proposed method integrates a variational autoencoder with a conditional diffusion model, compressing keyframes into latent space and reconstructing remaining frames via generative interpolation.

Result: The technique achieves up to 10x higher compression ratios compared to rule-based compressors like SZ3 and up to a 63% better performance than learning-based methods.

Conclusion: This framework bridges the gap in generative modeling for data compression, combining efficiency in storage with accurate reconstruction.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

*Tuo Wang,Jian Kang,Yujun Yan,Adithya Kulkarni,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCPNET is an advanced conformal prediction framework designed for temporal graphs, addressing coverage issues and improving prediction efficiency on dynamic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods struggle with dynamic graphs due to violations of exchangeability assumptions, limiting their application in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion-based non-conformity score and an efficiency-aware optimization algorithm to extend conformal prediction techniques to handle temporal graph uncertainties.

Result: NCPNET exhibits significant improvements, achieving up to a 31% reduction in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, and demonstrates robust coverage on various real-world temporal datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that NCPNET is an effective solution for conformal prediction in dynamic graphs, offering both computational efficiency and reliability in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a validation procedure to examine how responsive machine learning model predictions are to changes in input features, accounting for human interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety failures arise when models fail to consider how individuals can alter their input features, leading to potential risks in sensitive applications like lending and hiring.

Method: The authors introduce a sensitivity analysis-based framework to estimate responsiveness under practitioner-defined constraints, using black-box model access and algorithms that sample reachable points.

Result: They show how responsiveness estimates can falsify models, assess failure probabilities, and enhance safety in critical applications such as recidivism prediction and organ transplant prioritization.

Conclusion: The presented procedure and algorithms aid in creating safer machine learning systems by evaluating and addressing prediction responsiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

*Jiyeon Bae,Hyeon Jeon,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a workflow to reduce bias in evaluating dimensionality reduction projections using correlated metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in dimensionality reduction evaluation caused by selecting highly correlated metrics that favor specific structural characteristics.

Method: Cluster evaluation metrics based on their empirical correlations using pairwise correlations, minimizing overlap, and selecting representatives from clusters.

Result: Quantitative experiments show improved stability in dimensionality reduction evaluation using the proposed workflow.

Conclusion: The workflow mitigates evaluation bias in dimensionality reduction metrics, ensuring fairer assessments of projection techniques.

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

*Xinquan Huang,Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysicsCorrect is a training-free correction framework designed to address error accumulation in neural network-based PDE solvers by enforcing PDE consistency through a computationally efficient approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical limitation of error accumulation during long-term rollouts in neural network-based surrogates for PDEs, which often leads to divergence from physically valid solutions.

Method: PhysicsCorrect achieves PDE consistency through a training-free correction framework that formulates correction as a linearized inverse problem using PDE residuals. It introduces a caching strategy to precompute the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse during a warm-up phase, reducing computational complexity significantly.

Result: The framework achieves up to 100x reduction in prediction errors across various PDE systems, such as Navier-Stokes, wave equations, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, while adding negligible inference time (<5%).

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect transforms unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools, balancing computational efficiency and physical accuracy, and can be integrated across different neural architectures.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

*Shravan Doda,Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces VERBA, an approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to facilitate pairwise comparisons between machine learning models, addressing the challenge of 'model lake' proliferation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning users often face difficulties comparing and selecting models from a large pool ('model lake') with similar performance but differing behaviors, necessitating effective and scalable documentation methods.

Method: VERBA uses LLMs to generate verbalizations of model differences through sampling. A simulation-based protocol evaluates the informativeness of these verbalizations, and structural information is included to enhance accuracy.

Result: For decision tree models with up to 5% performance difference and 20-25% behavioral differences, VERBA achieves up to 80% verbalization accuracy, improving to 90% when structural information is incorporated.

Conclusion: VERBA enhances transparency and comparability in machine learning models post-hoc and offers a scalable solution for model users to understand differences among models.

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

### [177] [Order Acquisition Under Competitive Pressure: A Rapidly Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing Subsidy Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02244)
*Fangzhou Shi,Xiaopeng Ke,Xinye Xiong,Kexin Meng,Chang Men,Zhengdan Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FCA-RL, a reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize coupon strategies for ride-hailing service providers under budget constraints and market fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-hailing platforms incentivize providers to lower fares for competitive ranking, requiring better coupon strategies to optimize order acquisition while adhering to budgets.

Method: The authors developed FCA-RL, which integrates Fast Competition Adaptation (FCA) for dynamic price adjustments and Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA) for budget compliance, alongside a simulation environment named RideGym for evaluations.

Result: Experimental results show FCA-RL outperforms baseline methods in maintaining subsidy efficiency and acquiring orders under varying market conditions.

Conclusion: FCA-RL provides an effective subsidy optimization strategy and enables adaptability in competitive and dynamic ride-hailing markets.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces URDP, a novel framework combining large language models with uncertainty-aware techniques to improve reward function design and efficiency in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reward function design in reinforcement learning is inefficient and inconsistent, and current methods using large language models or evolutionary paradigms have limitations in optimization and computational resources.

Method: The proposed URDP framework uses large language models and incorporates uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization within a bi-level optimization architecture to quantify reward uncertainty, streamline design, and efficiently tune hyperparameters.

Result: Experiments in 35 tasks across three benchmark environments showed that URDP generates higher-quality reward functions and significantly improves the efficiency of automated reward design compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: URDP addresses inefficiencies in reward engineering by leveraging LLMs and advanced optimization techniques, making the design process more effective and resource-efficient.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KGZS-SC, a zero-shot semantic communication framework enhanced by knowledge graphs for improved interpretability and generalization, especially in scenarios involving unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic communication systems rely on statistical patterns, which lack generalization and interpretability, particularly for unseen data, necessitating approaches that can overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose a KGZS-SC network, utilizing a knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB) to provide structured semantic representations, reduce communication overhead, and facilitate zero-shot learning for unseen data classification at the receiver.

Result: Simulations on the APY datasets demonstrate that KGZS-SC outperforms existing frameworks in classifying unseen categories across diverse SNR levels while maintaining robust generalization.

Conclusion: KGZS-SC significantly enhances generalization, interpretability, and efficiency for unseen data cases, marking notable advancements in semantic communication frameworks.

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

*Alif Ashrafee,Jedrzej Kozal,Michal Wozniak,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Traditional continual learning approaches fall short under dynamic real-world concept drift scenarios. This paper introduces Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR) as a scalable solution, outperforming retraining while reducing resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of concept drift in real-world data streams, which traditional methods overlook by focusing solely on mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Method: AMR selectively removes outdated samples and populates memory with updated instances to handle evolving task distributions effectively.

Result: AMR matches the performance of Full Relearning while significantly reducing computational and annotation requirements in concept drift-affected datasets.

Conclusion: AMR offers a balance between stability and adaptability in continual learning environments, and its effectiveness is validated on multiple vision benchmarks.

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques

networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current XAI methods in clinical time series tasks, focusing on explaining changes in predictions over time for timely healthcare intervention.

Method: DeltaSHAP adapts Shapley values to temporal contexts, explains prediction changes using observed data, and introduces new evaluation metrics for faithfulness and efficiency in clinical applications.

Result: Experimental results show that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 62% better explanation quality and 33% faster computation on the MIMIC-III benchmark.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP provides real-time, accurate, and efficient explanations for clinical prediction tasks, making it suitable for critical healthcare applications.

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a simplified alternative to diffusion models for offline reinforcement learning (RL) that enhances performance by injecting and penalizing noise in actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL requires robust generalization since it operates solely on fixed datasets, and the current diffusion model methods, while successful, are computationally demanding.

Method: PANI improves offline RL by injecting noise into actions to explore the entire action space, combined with penalization based on the level of noise added.

Result: The method demonstrated substantial performance improvements across various offline RL benchmarks, and it is compatible with a broad range of RL algorithms.

Conclusion: PANI offers a computationally efficient and theoretically grounded approach to enhance offline RL, serving as a viable alternative to diffusion model-based methods.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fine-tuning approach using preference optimization to improve the consistency of multi-agent trajectory predictions in autonomous vehicle scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction models struggle with inconsistent predictions in complex, interactive traffic scenarios, posing risks for autonomous vehicles.

Method: The approach involves fine-tuning trajectory prediction models by incorporating automatically calculated preference rankings during the training process.

Result: The experiments demonstrate improved scene consistency across three datasets while minimally sacrificing accuracy and maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

Conclusion: Utilizing preference optimization in trajectory prediction models leads to better multi-agent interaction handling without hindering model performance or adding computational burden.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

*Zihan Tan,Suyuan Huang,Guancheng Wan,Wenke Huang,He Li,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces S2FGL, a framework for Federated Graph Learning, addressing graph signal disruptions on spatial and spectral levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Federated Graph Learning methods neglect spatial and spectral graph signal propagation, causing issues like label signal disruption and spectral heterogeneity.

Method: The paper proposes S2FGL, which includes a global knowledge repository to rectify label signal disruptions and a frequency alignment strategy to mitigate spectral client drifts.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of S2FGL in improving Federated Graph Learning performance.

Conclusion: S2FGL effectively addresses spatial and spectral challenges in Federated Graph Learning, enhancing global generalizability while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

*Francesco Alesiani,Henrik Christiansen,Federico Errica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfinityKAN adapts Kolmogorov Arnold Networks by optimizing the number of bases for univariate functions through variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to overcome the limitation of predefining the number of bases in KANs for function representation and makes them competitive with MLPs for representation learning.

Method: The researchers model the problem as variational inference and use backpropagation to adaptively learn an infinite number of bases during training.

Result: InfinityKAN facilitates hyperparameter-free training, improving the flexibility and applicability of Kolmogorov Arnold Networks.

Conclusion: InfinityKAN advances KANs as a viable representation learning approach by automating hyperparameter selection within the training process.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

*Chenxu Wang,Yilin Lyu,Zicheng Sun,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GORP, a method that enhances continual fine-tuning in LLMs by combining low-rank and full-rank parameters effectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the constraints of existing methods like LoRA in balancing efficiency and learning capacity for continual fine-tuning of LLMs.

Method: The authors design GORP, a novel training approach that combines full-rank and low-rank parameters and updates them within a unified gradient subspace to expand the optimization space.

Result: Experiments on continual learning benchmarks show that GORP outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions while preserving computational efficiency and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: GORP offers a significant advancement in continual learning for LLMs, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance, and proves superior to other approaches.

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is

*Alicja Rączkowska,Riccardo Belluzzo,Piotr Zieliński,Joanna Baran,Paweł Olszewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetrySQL proposes a novel training approach for text-to-SQL generation models utilizing self-correcting mechanisms, yielding significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited research on SQL-specific generative models despite the promise of self-correcting generation strategies in improving text-to-SQL capabilities.

Method: RetrySQL corrupts reasoning steps for SQL queries to create retry data containing incorrect and corrected entries. It continuously pre-trains an open-source coding model with this data.

Result: Using retry steps for pre-training improves execution accuracy by up to 4 percentage points. Pre-training (not fine-tuning) is essential for leveraging retry behavior.

Conclusion: RetrySQL successfully instills self-correcting behavior in models, improving SQL generation accuracy, and delivering competitive results against proprietary models in a text-to-SQL pipeline.

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

### [190] [Position: A Theory of Deep Learning Must Include Compositional Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02550)
*David A. Danhofer,Davide D'Ascenzo,Rafael Dubach,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) succeed by exploiting compositional sparsity in target functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental principles behind DNN learning dynamics and success.

Method: The authors analyze the compositional sparsity structure of target functions and its relation to deep learning.

Result: They establish that compositional sparseness is a property of efficiently Turing-computable functions, prevalent in learning problems.

Conclusion: Understanding compositional sparsity in DNNs is vital for advancing AI theory and intelligence development.

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

*Luca Baroni,Galvin Khara,Joachim Schaeffer,Marat Subkhankulov,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that layer normalization (LN) is unnecessary for GPT-2 models' functionality, with minimal impact on validation loss after its removal. LN-free models are proposed to enhance interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role of layer normalization (LN) in language models and improve mechanistic interpretability by removing the complexities LN introduces.

Method: The authors removed all LN layers from GPT-2 models, fine-tuned the models to compensate for the absence of LN, and analyzed the performance and interpretability of these LN-free models.

Result: Removing LN layers resulted in minor increases in validation loss (e.g., +0.03 cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Interpretability techniques applied to LN-free models showed exact effects of individual components, and "confidence neurons" were confirmed inactive in these models.

Conclusion: LN layers are not crucial for GPT-2-class language models, and removing them can improve interpretability with minimal performance cost. LN-free GPT-2 models can aid future research in understanding language models.

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces scalable and efficient Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) with a novel trainable interconnect. It proposes innovative pruning methods for model size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the scalability and efficiency of Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) while addressing resource-constrained hardware limitations and maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce a constant-parameter interconnect for wider layers and propose two pruning methods: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass and a similarity-based data-driven pruning pass.

Result: The proposed interconnect scales DBNs effectively to wide layers, and the novel pruning methods achieve superior compression-accuracy trade-offs compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations expand the scalability, efficiency, and compression capabilities of DBNs without sacrificing accuracy, making them more practical for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

TL;DR: This paper explores improving induction machine fault diagnosis by using Padé Approximant Neural Networks (PadéNets) and demonstrates superior performance over traditional CNNs and Self-ONNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in fault diagnostic performance for induction motors using existing deep learning models, specifically by testing whether PadéNets can yield better results with vibration and acoustic data.

Method: The study compares 1D CNNs, Self-ONNs, and PadéNets on induction motor datasets with vibration and acoustic inputs, leveraging PadéNet's advanced nonlinearity and unbounded activation functions like Leaky ReLU.

Result: PadéNets achieved diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33% across different sensors, consistently surpassing CNNs and Self-ONNs.

Conclusion: The enhanced nonlinearity and flexibility of PadéNets make them superior for fault diagnosis in induction motor condition monitoring, demonstrating their potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniDraft introduces a unified draft model framework that tackles incompatibility challenges with various target models and enables dynamic adaptation, showcasing significant efficiency in speculative decoding applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in speculative decoding, particularly concerning draft and target model compatibility, dynamic adaptation, and improving efficiency for lightweight on-device large language models (LLMs).

Method: OmniDraft employs an online n-gram cache for handling cross-vocabulary mismatches, hybrid distillation fine-tuning, and adaptive drafting techniques to enhance decoding efficiency.

Result: The framework allows a single draft model (e.g., Llama-68M) to pair seamlessly with diverse target models and achieves decoding speed improvements of 1.5-2x on tasks like math reasoning, coding, and text generation.

Conclusion: OmniDraft successfully enables a unified drafting model approach for speculative decoding, proving its versatility, adaptability, and efficiency across varied applications and models.

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using latent-space diffusion models to reduce computational costs while emulating dynamical systems, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness even with significant compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if latent-space diffusion models can be effectively employed for dynamical system emulation and address the computational costs associated with diffusion models in physics emulation.

Method: The study applies latent-space emulation using diffusion models for dynamical systems, analyzing its accuracy across varying compression rates and comparing it with non-generative counterparts.

Result: The accuracy of the latent-space emulation was robust under high compression rates (up to 1000x). Diffusion-based emulators outperformed non-generative methods in accuracy and diversity of predictions.

Conclusion: Latent-space emulation is a viable strategy for efficient dynamical system emulation, offering both computational savings and accuracy advantages. Design choices are critical for successful training.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposing a Learnable VAE (L-VAE) model that learns disentangled representations and optimizes hyperparameters for its loss function, outperforming other VAE variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled representation learning often struggles with selecting the right trade-offs in loss functions; L-VAE aims to address this by learning these trade-offs dynamically.

Method: Introduces a model, L-VAE, that jointly learns the weights of disentanglement and reconstruction losses alongside model parameters, adding a regularization term to avoid bias.

Result: The L-VAE consistently surpasses or matches state-of-the-art VAEs in disentanglement tasks across multiple datasets, showing quantitative and qualitative excellence.

Conclusion: L-VAE effectively balances reconstruction fidelity and disentanglement, making it a robust solution for disentangled latent representation learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based variational autoencoder (matVAE) that evaluates protein variant effects using both MSAs and DMS datasets. It achieves strong performance with fewer parameters and computation, showcasing the potential of DMS datasets for VEP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VEP methods rely heavily on MSAs, which might not be ideal for pharmacogenes under low evolutionary pressure. DMS datasets provide a quantitative alternative that could inform more accurate variant effect predictions.

Method: The authors developed a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a structured prior. They tested its performance on 33 DMS datasets from the ProteinGym benchmark, comparing MSA-trained matVAE (matVAE-MSA) and DMS-trained versions, while also integrating AlphaFold-generated structural data.

Result: matVAE-MSA outperformed DeepSequence in zero-shot DMS prediction, requiring significantly fewer parameters and less computational power. Adding AlphaFold structural data improved its performance to rival models fine-tuned on DMS data.

Conclusion: The study highlights the viability of DMS datasets as a substitute for MSAs in VEPs, encouraging their further development and integration into predictive models to better understand protein variants.

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

TL;DR: Introducing Medical Data Pecking approach for assessing EHR quality using automated testing with LLMs. Evaluated successfully on AoU, MIMIC-III, and SyntheticMass datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain biases and errors, making them unreliable for epidemiological studies and AI training. Traditional quality assessment methods are insufficient, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The proposed Medical Data Pecking approach adapts unit testing and coverage concepts from software engineering. This involves two components: (1) an automated test generator using large language models (LLMs) and (2) a data testing framework for executing these tests.

Result: The Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT) was evaluated on three datasets (All of Us, MIMIC-III, and SyntheticMass), generating 55-73 tests per cohort. It identified 20-43 data quality issues, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: By embedding external medical knowledge, the proposed method enables context-aware data quality checks, enhancing EHR data validity. Future developments aim to expand to other data modalities and refine grounding techniques.

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical deep learning framework for recursively meta-learning tasks via virtual task generation and category-theoretic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to create a meta-learning framework that overcomes the limitations of human-generated data by enabling neural networks to autonomously construct and generalize tasks, thus advancing artificial intelligence.

Method: The framework generates virtual tasks to learn soft constraints and generalized rules, refines tasks through meta-level hierarchies, and leverages category-theoretic interpretations to structure and unify learning models.

Result: The framework provides structured and interpretable learning progressions, enhances generalization, and offers a unified theoretical foundation for meta-learning using category theory.

Conclusion: This architecture could pave the way for neural networks to autonomously generate, structure, and solve novel tasks, moving closer to achieving general artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

### [200] [ExPO: Unlocking Hard Reasoning with Self-Explanation-Guided Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02834)
*Ruiyang Zhou,Shuozhe Li,Amy Zhang,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO), a new reinforcement learning post-training framework designed to improve reasoning by generating effective positive samples via self-exploration, especially in challenging tasks like MATH level-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-style post-training methods largely refine models by sharpening their output distribution based on positive samples, but they struggle in scenarios where the model initially fails to generate such samples, particularly in early-stage training or challenging reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose ExPO, which conditions on ground-truth answers to generate sufficiently good positive samples. These samples are both likely under the current model policy and enhance the model's likelihood of arriving at correct answers, thus improving exploration and reasoning efficiency.

Result: ExPO demonstrated improved learning efficiency and outperformed expert-demonstration-based methods on reasoning benchmarks, including higher performance on challenging tasks like MATH level-5.

Conclusion: ExPO provides a more effective reinforcement learning mechanism by leveraging self-conditioned positive samples, addressing the limitations of earlier approaches and making significant improvements in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

### [201] [On Efficient Bayesian Exploration in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02639)
*Alberto Caron,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework (PTS-BE) for improving data-efficient exploration using information-theoretic intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning, overcoming challenges in environments with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in reinforcement learning by aligning exploratory behavior with epistemic uncertainty, avoiding inefficiencies from aleatoric noise.

Method: It investigates exploration bonuses based on epistemic uncertainty, establishes theoretical guarantees, leverages Gaussian Processes and deep learning approximations, and introduces a framework combining model-based planning and Bayesian exploration (PTS-BE).

Result: PTS-BE achieves superior sample-efficient exploration compared to other baselines, validated through diverse environments with sparse rewards and purely exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: The research provides a theoretical foundation for information-gain-based exploration and offers a promising framework to overcome sparse and challenging reinforcement learning environments.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

### [202] [Fair Deepfake Detectors Can Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02645)
*Harry Cheng,Ming-Hui Liu,Yangyang Guo,Tianyi Wang,Liqiang Nie,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the trade-off between fairness and generalization in deepfake detection models and proposes a novel framework, DAID, to address both challenges using targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models struggle with generalization to unseen manipulations and ensuring fairness across demographic groups, and these goals often conflict with each other.

Method: The authors formally define a causal relationship between fairness and generalization and use back-door adjustment techniques. They propose DAID, which includes demographic-aware data rebalancing and demographic-agnostic feature aggregation to address biases and improve performance.

Result: Across three benchmarks, DAID outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in both fairness and generalization, affirming its theoretical and practical validity.

Conclusion: Controlling confounders facilitates better generalization through fairness interventions, and DAID offers a robust solution for improving fairness and generalization simultaneously.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

### [203] [Guided Generation for Developable Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02670)
*Siqi Zhao,Joshua Moller,Porfi Quintero-Cadena,Lood van Niekerk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to optimize therapeutic antibody sequences for clinical effectiveness by introducing a guided discrete diffusion model integrated with Soft Value-based Decoding, enabling better developability predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing therapeutic antibodies with optimal developability properties is crucial for their clinical success. Thus, the need for a computational framework arises to achieve high performance in both binding and biophysical properties.

Method: The authors introduce a guided discrete diffusion model trained on paired heavy-light chain sequences and clinical-stage antibody developability data. A Soft Value-based Decoding Module is applied to guide generation while preserving natural sequence attributes.

Result: The model generates antibodies that replicate features of natural repertoires and approved therapeutics, while achieving higher enrichments in developability scores under SVDD guidance compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates a robust pipeline for designing antibodies that meet both biophysical and binding criteria, making it suitable for iterative ML-driven antibody development.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

*Francesco Di Salvo,Hanh Huyen My Nguyen,Christian Ledig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using Differentially Private generative models for training in decentralized medical imaging scenarios to address data scarcity and privacy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data scarcity, privacy challenges, and inefficiencies of Federated Learning (FL) for medical imaging while enabling support for diverse downstream tasks.

Method: The method employs foundation models to extract compact embeddings and trains a Differentially Private Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) collaboratively for global, privacy-aware data distributions.

Result: The proposed DP-CVAE approach outperforms traditional FL classifiers in privacy, scalability, and efficiency, producing high-fidelity embeddings with significantly fewer parameters compared to DP-CGAN.

Conclusion: This work introduces an effective decentralized privacy-preserving data-sharing approach, offering improved performance and adaptability for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

### [205] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Pricing in Supply Chains: Benchmarking Strategic Agent Behaviours under Realistically Simulated Market Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02698)
*Thomas Hazenberg,Yao Ma,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari,Marijn van Rijswijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches to enhance dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, comparing them to traditional static rule-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of traditional rule-based pricing approaches that fail to capture the strategic interactions in supply chains.

Method: Three MARL algorithms—MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX—are evaluated using simulated environments based on real e-commerce data and a LightGBM demand prediction model, against static baselines.

Result: Rule-based agents achieved high fairness and price stability but lacked competition. MARL agents displayed dynamic behaviors; MADDPG balanced competition, fairness, and stability, while MADQN showed aggressive pricing at the expense of fairness.

Conclusion: MARL algorithms can enable emergent strategic behaviors not possible with static methods, indicating their potential for advancing dynamic pricing in supply chains.

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

### [206] [Fluid Democracy in Federated Data Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02710)
*Aditya Vema Reddy Kesari,Krishna Reddy Kesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consensus-based approach for federated learning (FedVRD) to minimize wasteful data transfer and mitigate adversarial impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current federated learning systems transfer model weights from all clients without considering their utility, leading to unnecessary data transfer costs.

Method: A new protocol, 'viscous-retained democracy,' is introduced for federated learning. The paper examines existing fluid democracy models, proposes improvements to limit influence accumulation, and develops FedVRD to counter adversaries using dynamic delegation topology.

Result: The proposed FedVRD reduces both adversarial influence and data transfer costs while maintaining high performance compared to traditional methods like 1p1v (FedAvg).

Conclusion: Consensus-based protocols, specifically FedVRD, are effective in enhancing federated learning by reducing costs and vulnerabilities to adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

### [207] [A Forget-and-Grow Strategy for Deep Reinforcement Learning Scaling in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02712)
*Zilin Kang,Chenyuan Hu,Yu Luo,Zhecheng Yuan,Ruijie Zheng,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm called Forget and Grow (FoG), designed to address the primacy bias in deep reinforcement learning by combining mechanisms inspired by human memory and learning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks by addressing the issue of primacy bias, where models overly rely on early training experiences, reducing sample efficiency and generalizability.

Method: The method involves two mechanisms: (1) Experience Replay Decay, which gradually reduces the influence of early experiences, and (2) Network Expansion, which adds new neural components to enhance learning during training.

Result: FoG demonstrates superior performance across over 40 tasks in continuous control benchmarks, outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms like BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Conclusion: Incorporating neuroscience-inspired forgetting and growing mechanisms, FoG improves sample efficiency and generalizability in deep reinforcement learning, addressing the limitations of primacy bias.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

*Omri Porat,Michael Fire,Eran Ben-Elia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced framework for predicting dockless e-scooter demand by integrating spatial, temporal, and network data, resulting in 27-49% improvement in prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to predict micromobility demand accurately to enhance fleet distribution and urban infrastructure management.

Method: The authors propose a framework that combines spatial, temporal, and network dependencies to forecast micromobility demand patterns.

Result: The framework achieves 27-49% better accuracy in forecasting micromobility demand compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize data-driven micromobility management for better fleet distribution, lower costs, and informed urban planning decisions.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

*Shiyi Liu,Buwen Liang,Yuetong Fang,Zixuan Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HIPPO, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework for predicting protein-protein interactions, showcasing state-of-the-art results and robustness in limited-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the challenge of predicting protein-protein interactions across diverse species and data modalities, especially in scenarios with sparse or rare data.

Method: HIPPO employs hierarchical contrastive loss functions to align protein sequences and hierarchical attributes, enforcing consistency with protein functional hierarchies and integrating domain knowledge through a penalty mechanism.

Result: HIPPO outperformed existing methods on benchmark datasets, excelled in low-data regimes, and demonstrated zero-shot transferability across species.

Conclusion: The study enhances cross-species protein-protein prediction, offering a robust framework for addressing sparse or imbalanced biological datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

*Aurko Roy,Timothy Chou,Sai Surya Duvvuri,Sijia Chen,Jiecao Yu,Xiaodong Wang,Manzil Zaheer,Rohan Anil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the 2-simplicial Transformer, a modification that improves token efficiency in large language models using a generalized attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models currently assume compute-bound scenarios and infinite data, but massive datasets are making these assumptions less valid. There's a demand for architectures that maximize token efficiency.

Method: The 2-simplicial Transformer generalizes dot-product attention into trilinear functions, implemented via an efficient Triton kernel. This architecture is evaluated for token efficiency on specific tasks.

Result: The 2-simplicial Transformer displays better token efficiency than standard Transformers. Models perform better on knowledge and reasoning tasks under fixed token budgets, altering scaling law exponents.

Conclusion: The 2-simplicial Transformer offers an improved architecture for token efficiency, making it a promising alternative for modern language models dealing with limited tokens.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

### [211] [Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Recurrent Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02782)
*Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of recurrent models failing to length generalize when exposed to training data with limited state distributions. It proposes simple training interventions to enhance state coverage, enabling these models to process sequences much longer than their training context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent models, while theoretically capable of processing arbitrarily long sequences, struggle with length generalization, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical and theoretical analysis to validate the unexplored states hypothesis. They introduced training interventions, such as initializing the state with Gaussian noise or with the final state of different input sequences, to broaden the range of states encountered during training.

Result: With minimal post-training (500 steps, ~0.1% of pre-training), the proposed interventions allowed models to generalize to significantly longer sequences (e.g., 2k training context extended to 128k sequences) and improved performance in long context tasks.

Conclusion: Simple and cost-effective training strategies can substantially enhance the length generalization capabilities of recurrent models, addressing a key limitation in their practical usage.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

*Thiti Suttaket,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRADUATE, a survival analysis model that achieves multicalibration by ensuring well-calibrated predictions for all subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor calibration of survival models, especially for minority subpopulations, can lead to erroneous clinical decisions and lacks inclusivity.

Method: GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained optimization problem, optimizing calibration and discrimination simultaneously during training. Mathematical proofs ensure the solution is near-optimal and feasible.

Result: GRADUATE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficacy, as demonstrated through experiments on real-world clinical datasets.

Conclusion: GRADUATE provides a robust approach to survival analysis by achieving multicalibration, reducing the risk of poor calibration for minority subpopulations.

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore distribution testing through the lens of algorithmic replicability, aiming to determine how many samples are needed to reliably test distribution properties.

Method: The authors propose new replicable algorithms for closeness and independence testing of discrete distributions and introduce a novel technique to establish lower bounds for sample complexity in replicable testing scenarios.

Result: They derive near-optimal sample complexity lower bounds for tasks like replicable uniformity and closeness testing, answering open questions from prior studies.

Conclusion: The paper advances both the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of replicable distribution testing by providing new tools and optimally resolving open questions about sample complexity in this area.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

*Yuchen Ma,Dennis Frauen,Jonas Schweisthal,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of biased treatment effect estimation caused by discrepancies between training and inference data (structured data vs. textual descriptions).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized decision-making in medicine where treatment effect estimation often faces challenges from incomplete textual patient information at inference time.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining large language models with a custom doubly robust learner to mitigate inference time text confounding biases.

Result: The proposed framework effectively reduces biases and shows promising performance in experimental evaluations on real-world data.

Conclusion: The paper introduces an effective method to bridge data discrepancies in treatment effect estimation and advances personalized medicine applications.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects

TL;DR: The paper introduces MvHo-IB, a framework that enhances diagnostic accuracy in fMRI data analysis by integrating higher-order interactions and pairwise interactions in a compressive multi-view learning setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges persist in effectively extracting and utilizing higher-order interactions (HOIs) in fMRI data, despite their potential for improving diagnostic accuracy.

Method: The authors propose MvHo-IB, which combines O-information, a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator, a Brain3DCNN encoder, and a multi-view information bottleneck objective to analyze fMRI data.

Result: MvHo-IB demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark fMRI datasets, surpassing traditional and hypergraph-based methods.

Conclusion: MvHo-IB effectively integrates and compresses task-relevant information, providing a novel and superior method for diagnostic decision-making in fMRI data.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

*Meng Xu,Frank Neumann,Aneta Neumann,Yew Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Quality-Diversity (QD) framework for tackling dynamic scheduling problems by mapping heuristics to diverse behavioral solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for generating high-performing yet diverse solutions in dynamic combinatorial optimization problems, highlighting the gap in applying QD algorithms to such dynamic contexts and the lack of theoretical understanding in learning heuristics rather than direct solutions.

Method: The authors propose a map-building strategy to link heuristic genotypes to behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD map. This method focuses on exploration and maintenance of diverse scheduling heuristics, tested on both static and dynamic training instances.

Result: The experiments demonstrate evolving QD maps that reveal how solution distributions adjust over time for dynamically changing problem scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise in enhancing the application of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial problems, and the paper outlines potential future research paths to refine and expand the framework.

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

TL;DR: The study uses algorithm footprints to analyze how configurations of the CMA-ES algorithm affect performance across various problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the relationship between algorithm configurations and problem characteristics, aiming to optimize algorithm performance and interpretability.

Method: Using algorithm footprints, the paper evaluates six variants of CMA-ES across 24 benchmark problems at different dimensions, analyzing their performance and problem interaction patterns.

Result: Variations in algorithm configuration showed distinct performance outcomes driven by problem-specific features, with shared and divergent patterns observed.

Conclusion: Algorithm footprints are effective tools for enhancing interpretability and aiding in the selection of algorithm configurations tailored to specific problem characteristics.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new visualization approach and metrics to analyze numerical metaheuristic algorithms, enhancing understanding of their stability and comparative behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for analyzing numerical metaheuristic algorithms are insufficient for interpreting their dynamics in complex, high-dimensional spaces.

Method: The paper proposes a clustering-based visualization technique and introduces metrics like algorithm stability and similarity to analyze the behavior of numerical metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Applying their methodology to ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms reveals detailed insights into their stability and comparative dynamics during optimization.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel methodology to visualize and understand search dynamics, enabling improved analysis and comparison of numerical metaheuristic algorithms.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

### [219] [An Experimental Approach for Running-Time Estimation of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Numerical Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02372)
*Han Huang,Tianyu Wang,Chaoda Peng,Tongli He,Zhifeng Hao*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an experimental method to estimate upper bounds on the running time of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms without algorithmic or problem simplifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding the running time performance of MOEAs for numerical optimization due to reliance on simplifications in existing studies.

Method: The proposed approach uses an average gain model, statistical methods for probabilistic distributions, and an adaptive sampling method to dynamically handle the irregular gain patterns found in MOEAs.

Result: The experiments on five MOEAs using benchmark suites (ZDT and DTLZ) show the method effectively estimates running time upper bounds without simplifications. A web-based implementation is also provided.

Conclusion: This work complements theoretical research by providing a practical approach to analyze MOEAs' running times in numerical optimization.

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multiple-gain model to enhance running-time analysis for combinatorial optimization using ($\mu+\lambda$) evolutionary algorithms, yielding tighter theoretical bounds and practical alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the scarcity of theoretical results concerning ($\mu+\lambda$) evolutionary algorithms in combinatorial optimization compared to simpler pseudo-Boolean functions.

Method: The paper employs a multiple-gain model, improving the average gain model, to analyze the expected first hitting time in both average-case and worst-case scenarios.

Result: Theoretical findings include tighter time complexity upper bounds for combinatorial problems like knapsack, $k$-MAX-SAT, and TSP. Experimental validations confirm alignment between theory and practice.

Conclusion: The multiple-gain model is an effective framework for analyzing running times of ($\mu+\lambda$) EAs in combinatorial optimization, offering significant theoretical insights and practical reliability.

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.

### [221] [DecoRTL: A Run-time Decoding Framework for RTL Code Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02226)
*Mohammad Akyash,Kimia Azar,Hadi Kamali*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with structural and semantic needs in RTL code generation due to conventional decoding methods. DecoRTL, a novel inference-time strategy, integrates syntax-aware and contrastive techniques to improve validity, correctness, and diversity in RTL outputs while minimizing execution overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges in using large language models (LLMs) for RTL code generation, specifically focusing on decoding failures such as invalid, repetitive, or hallucinated code outputs.

Method: DecoRTL, a novel decoding approach, includes self-consistency sampling to re-rank candidates based on token-level agreement and syntax-aware temperature adaptation to classify tokens. It ensures deterministic decoding for syntax-critical tokens and variability for exploratory ones without requiring model fine-tuning.

Result: Using the VerilogEval benchmark and multiple LLMs, DecoRTL showed improvements in syntactic validity, functional correctness, and output diversity with negligible performance overhead.

Conclusion: DecoRTL offers an effective run-time strategy to enhance LLM's RTL code generation capabilities, achieving better code quality without fine-tuning or additional computational burden.

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

TL;DR: Robots are explained best with concise explanations during surprising actions in daily tasks. Proposed algorithms help improve human-robot interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and trust in robots by providing explanations during confusing robot actions, avoiding user annoyance.

Method: Explored user preferences for explanation timing and content during a robot's cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Proposed algorithms to identify surprising actions and generate explanations.

Result: Users prefer brief, intention-focused explanations in surprising situations. Developed two algorithms to improve the explanation process in robots using BDI reasoning.

Conclusion: Offering concise, clear, and context-relevant explanations enhances human-robot interaction and trust. The proposed algorithms can seamlessly work with the BDI framework.

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

*Miroslav Cibula,Kristína Malinovská,Matthias Kerzel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a self-supervised learning approach using a recurrent architecture for trajectory planning of robotic arms, moving beyond traditional supervised imitation learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory planning in robotics typically relies on computationally intensive sampling-based planners or supervised imitation learning, which do not evaluate success in reaching goals. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning method.

Method: The authors propose a recurrent neural architecture to build a trajectory model that learns from paired forward and inverse kinematics models in a self-supervised manner.

Result: The proposed model successfully generates trajectories for robotic arm kinematic planning without requiring imitation learning and suggests potential for handling more complex tasks.

Conclusion: This novel self-supervised learning approach demonstrates feasibility for improving robot trajectory planning, showing promise for addressing adaptive and complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Result: The approach exhibited competitive performance in simulated datasets, strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities, and effectiveness on real-world robotic systems.

Conclusion: This lightweight and efficient VLA model successfully handles manipulation tasks with reduced training demands, demonstrating adaptability across simulations and real environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

Motivation: To address the unobservability of yaw in dead-reckoning and achieve drift-free localization with accurate orientation estimation in challenging GPS conditions.

Method: An extension of the original DRIFT algorithm involves a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline using an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and introduces a heading correction mechanism with GPS course-over-ground and IMU data.

Result: The approach was successfully validated on a Blue Robotics BlueBoat, demonstrating effective yaw observation and localization even in GPS-degraded environments.

Conclusion: The paper provides an open-source solution for robust, drift-free orientation and localization systems, potentially applicable across various mobile platforms.

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and
heading estimation. Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine
autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other
mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm,
we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant
extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS
directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized
Blue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic
approach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free
localization and reliable orientation estimation. This work provides an open

Conclusion: The simulator is a practical and promising tool for validating autonomous vehicle controls with improved fidelity and reduced resource requirements, paving the way for better deployment in intelligent traffic systems.

Abstract: Simulators are useful tools for testing automated driving controllers.
Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to
physical vehicles. However, conventional ViL tests rely on full-size vehicles,
requiring large space and high expenses. Also, physical-model-based DT suffers

comprehensive and practical simulator for testing automated driving controllers
enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars
allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving
controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the
simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

TL;DR: This paper outlines the development of a Digital Twin for the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-Württemberg, enabling real-world and simulated data exchange for traffic flow optimization and security simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore digitalization in mobility by creating interconnected infrastructure via a Digital Twin, enhancing road traffic monitoring and simulations.

Method: Digital Twin created using object lists extracted from camera and LiDAR sensors at intersections, integrated into a unified simulation framework.

Result: A publicly available framework showcasing applications like traffic optimization and communication security simulations.

Conclusion: The Digital Twin enhances traffic management and security analysis, promoting advanced infrastructure for autonomous driving.

Abstract: In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for collaborative perception in autonomous driving that achieves high accuracy without requiring direct model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of individual perception systems in autonomous driving, such as high communication bandwidth requirements and proprietary model restrictions.

Method: The authors propose a late collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, working solely on shared bounding box attributes without accessing detection model parameters.

Result: The framework achieves significantly lower positional, scale, and orientation errors compared to existing methods, with 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from heterogeneous systems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses real-world challenges in collaborative perception, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and efficiency in multi-agent fusion.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

*Shivam Chaubey,Francesco Verdoja,Shankar Deka,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shared control framework that guarantees safety, scalability, and feasibility in human-autonomous decision-making by addressing challenges in existing methods like unpredictability of user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shared control methods struggle with challenges such as feasibility, scalability, and safety guarantees, especially given unpredictable user inputs, prompting the need for a robust solution.

Method: An assistive controller framework is developed using a Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates a precomputed Control Invariant Set for online computation of control actions. It accommodates non-convex constraints and ensures minimal override of user intent.

Result: The approach was validated through a large-scale user study with 66 participants using a computer game, showing consistent improvements in task load, trust, perceived control, and task performance without compromising safety.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances task effectiveness and user experience, offering a scalable, feasible, and safe solution in shared control systems.

Abstract: Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

*Xiang Zhou,Xinyu Zhang,Qingrui Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage hierarchical learning framework to improve quadruped locomotion's robustness and compliance in the presence of external disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving both robust and compliant quadruped locomotion, especially under unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods emphasize robustness but sacrifice compliance, leading to energy inefficiency.

Method: The approach consists of two stages: 1) Training a velocity-tracking policy with an auto-encoder for capturing historical proprioceptive features and a supervised learning-based force estimator. 2) Developing a compliance action module inspired by impedance control to fine-tune velocity commands in response to real-time force estimates.

Result: The proposed framework enables quadruped robots to effectively handle disturbances with improved robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiments in simulations and real-world scenarios show that the method outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning-based controllers.

Conclusion: The research achieves a balance between robustness and compliance in quadruped locomotion. The compliance action module is a critical factor in its success.

Abstract: Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of
unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion
robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Method: Developed Flix-Walker, using helix-shaped beams as legs actuated by vibration motors, analyzed locomotion through simulations and experiments, and established a metric for robust motion control.

Result: Experimental validation shows reliable trajectory tracking and self-navigation capabilities under various system and environmental conditions within a closed-loop control framework.

Conclusion: Flix-Walker demonstrates the potential of compliant under-actuated designs for robust and functional robotic mobility.

Abstract: Under-actuated compliant robotic systems offer a promising approach to
mitigating actuation and control challenges by harnessing pre-designed,
embodied dynamic behaviors. This paper presents Flix-Walker, a novel,
untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as
legs, which are actuated by vibrations from just two motors to achieve three
distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype
experiments. The effects of system and environmental variations on locomotion
performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in articulated object manipulation due to complex kinematics and limited physical reasoning capabilities of existing methods.

Method: ArtGS integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting for RGB-D reconstruction with vision-language models to extract semantic and structural information. It uses differentiable rendering to optimize articulated bone parameters for physically consistent motion and adapts cross-embodiment through dynamic modeling and closed-loop optimization.

Result: ArtGS outperforms previous methods in joint estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across diverse articulated objects in simulations and real-world settings.

Conclusion: ArtGS is a promising framework for efficient, scalable, and generalizable modeling and manipulation of articulated objects, marking significant advancements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,
scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.
Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments
demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint

TL;DR: This paper addresses where to start deploying robots in disaster scenarios for optimal coverage and efficiency, presenting a joint optimization method and achieving significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this work is to enhance the efficiency of robotic deployment in disaster scenarios by optimizing the starting locations of robots, a critical but underexplored area in search and rescue operations.

Method: The paper uses a joint optimization framework with an added constraint to the ergodic optimization method, allowing for the assignment of optimal starting locations for heterogeneous robots, based on potential starting location data.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement in coverage performance compared to fixed-start baselines, with 35.98% improvement on synthetic data and 31.91% on real-world data for both homogeneous and heterogeneous teams.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves situational awareness and effectiveness in disaster response scenarios by optimizing robot starting locations, demonstrating its potential for enhancing search and rescue operations.

Abstract: In disaster response scenarios, deploying robotic teams effectively is
crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

Motivation: Mobile manipulators often face challenges in motion planning due to their nonholonomic dynamics and the need to find collision-free, efficient trajectories. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on a structured approach for achieving optimal and feasible trajectories.

Method: A hierarchical pipeline is adopted. First, the method identifies multiple topologically distinct collision-free paths for the base to define solution spaces. Then, parallel sampling and trajectory optimization are conducted using polynomial trajectories and an arc length-yaw parameterization to handle nonholonomic constraints and ensure efficiency.

Result: The proposed method efficiently plans feasible and optimal whole-body trajectories while addressing the nonholonomic dynamics of differential drive mobile manipulators.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that hierarchical planning with topology-based search and optimization techniques provides an effective solution for complex motion planning in mobile manipulators.

Abstract: We present an efficient hierarchical motion planning pipeline for
differential drive mobile manipulators. Our approach first searches for
multiple collisionfree and topologically distinct paths for the mobile base to
extract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and
optimization are then conducted in parallel to explore feasible whole-body
trajectories. For trajectory optimization, we employ polynomial trajectories
and arc length-yaw parameterization, enabling efficient handling of the
nonholonomic dynamics while ensuring optimality.

TL;DR: MultiGen framework integrates generative models with simulators for multisensory simulation, achieving successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer in robot pouring tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of enabling robots to learn multimodal policies at scale, crucial for real-world tasks but hindered by difficulties in simulating certain modalities like sound.

Method: The authors develop MultiGen, which combines generative models with physics-based simulation to synthesize realistic audiovisual trajectories, facilitating training without relying on real robot data.

Result: MultiGen achieves zero-shot transfer in robot pouring tasks, successfully handling novel containers and liquids in the real world using multimodal feedback.

Conclusion: Generative modeling via MultiGen can improve simulation of complex modalities and bridge the sim-to-real gap, advancing robot capabilities in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the lack of preparation resources and the challenges faced by candidates in navigating technical interviews, which are commonly absent in computing curricula.

Method: The researchers collected data through a survey of 131 candidates actively preparing for technical interviews to understand their preparation strategies and experiences.

Result: Findings reveal that candidates rarely train under authentic interview settings, and educational courses are insufficient in supporting their preparation, resulting in stress and feelings of unpreparedness.

Conclusion: The paper suggests actionable improvements for stakeholders to better support candidates in preparing for technical interviews for software engineering roles.

Abstract: To obtain employment, aspiring software engineers must complete technical
interviews -- a hiring process which involves candidates writing code while
communicating to an audience. However, the complexities of tech interviews are
difficult to prepare for and seldom faced in computing curricula. To this end,
we seek to understand how candidates prepare for technical interviews,
investigating the effects of preparation methods and the role of education. We
distributed a survey to candidates (n = 131) actively preparing for technical
interviews. Our results suggest candidates rarely train in authentic settings
and courses fail to support preparation efforts -- leading to stress and

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to bridge the gap between natural language queries and structural code search by leveraging an LLM to interpret natural language queries and translate them into domain-specific languages (DSLs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Using natural language for structural code search simplifies an otherwise complex process of query formulation in domain-specific languages.

Method: A large language model converts natural language queries to DSL queries, enabling effective use of structural code search tools like Semgrep and GQL.

Result: Achieves 55%-70% precision and recall, outperforming semantic code search and other baselines by significant margins.

Conclusion: Lowering the learning curve and improving efficiency in code search, this approach shows promise as a robust solution for developers.

Abstract: Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs,
learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most
commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and
widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code
search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic
structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to
systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools
operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be
difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural
language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural
language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to
entry.
  In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning
capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the
power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve
relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search
DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for
structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show
that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to
DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision
and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly
outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to
57% and 14% on F1 scores.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates using internal software metrics from source code to predict mobile app popularity before release, reporting that classification models outperform regression models in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide app developers with a strategic tool for predicting popularity in competitive markets using measurable internal software metrics before deployment.

Method: The study uses regression and classification models on features such as code metrics, code smells, and metadata from a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps, applying various feature-selection approaches.

Result: Regression models performed poorly due to skewed data, while binary classification models, particularly a Multilayer Perceptron using selected features, achieved an F1-score of 0.72.

Conclusion: Internal code metrics, while limited in explanatory power, are valuable predictors for app popularity, countering prior views dismissing their relevance to software quality.

Abstract: Predicting mobile app popularity before release can provide developers with a
strategic advantage in a competitive marketplace, yet it remains a challenging
problem. This study explores whether internal software metrics, measurable from
source code before deployment, can predict an app's popularity, defined by user
ratings (calculated from user reviews) and DownloadsPerYear (yearly downloads).
Using a dataset of 446 open-source Android apps from F-Droid, we extract a wide
array of features, including system-, class-, and method-level code metrics,
code smells, and app metadata. Additional information, such as user reviews,
download counts, and uses-permission, was collected from the Google Play Store.
We evaluate regression and classification models across three feature sets: a
minimal Size-only baseline, a domain-informed Handpicked set, and a Voting set
derived via feature selection algorithms. Regression models perform poorly due
to skewed data, with low $R^2$ scores. However, when reframed as binary
classification (Popular vs. Unpopular), results improve significantly. The best
model, a Multilayer Perceptron using the Voting set, achieves F1-scores of
0.72. These results suggest that internal code metrics, although limited in
their explanatory power, can serve as useful indicators of app popularity. This
challenges earlier findings that dismissed internal metrics as predictors of

### [245] [A Multimodal Approach Combining Biometrics and Self-Report Instruments for Monitoring Stress in Programming: Methodological Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02118)
*Cristina Martinez Montes,Daniela Grassi,Nicole Novielli,Birgit Penzenstadle*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines stress during software tasks using psychometric and biometric measures, finding mixed results and insignificant stress induction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and compare psychometric and biometric methods for measuring stress during software engineering tasks, addressing biases in traditional self-reports.

Method: Participants wore biometric sensors, completed coding tasks under time limits, pre- and post-surveys, and a final interview.

Result: No significant psychometric stress detected; mixed subjective stress reports; only EDA phasic peaks showed biometric stress differences.

Conclusion: The study's stress-induction method, a strict time limit, was insufficient. Methodological insights are offered for future stress studies.

Abstract: The study of well-being, stress and other human factors has traditionally
relied on self-report instruments to assess key variables. However, concerns
about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and
standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these
measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures.
  We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators
and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software
engineering tasks.
  We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then
programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for
each, and finally went through a short exit interview.
  Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric
instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress
and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant
difference only in EDA phasic peaks.
  We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter
time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future
studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.

*Martin Obaidi,Marc Herrmann,Jil Klünder,Kurt Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates linguistic and statistical traits across developer communication datasets and proposes a method to recommend suitable sentiment analysis tools based on dataset characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variability in communication style and content across platforms leads to inconsistencies in sentiment analysis tool performance, necessitating a method to improve tool selection for reliable analytics.

Method: The study examines 10 developer communication datasets across five platforms, evaluates 14 sentiment analysis tools, and introduces a mapping approach and questionnaire to match suitable tools based on dataset features.

Result: Dataset characteristics are found to play a significant role in selecting effective sentiment analysis tools, with transformer-based models like SetFit and RoBERTa achieving better results, albeit depending on context.

Conclusion: The proposed method aids researchers and practitioners in identifying trustworthy sentiment analysis tools for software engineering while emphasizing the need for continuous evaluation as communication norms change.

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on text-based communication, making
sentiment analysis a valuable tool for understanding team dynamics and
supporting trustworthy AI-driven analytics in requirements engineering.
However, existing sentiment analysis tools often perform inconsistently across
datasets from different platforms, due to variations in communication style and
content.
  In this study, we analyze linguistic and statistical features of 10 developer
communication datasets from five platforms and evaluate the performance of 14
sentiment analysis tools. Based on these results, we propose a mapping approach
and questionnaire that recommends suitable sentiment analysis tools for new
datasets, using their characteristic features as input.
  Our results show that dataset characteristics can be leveraged to improve
tool selection, as platforms differ substantially in both linguistic and
statistical properties. While transformer-based models such as SetFit and
RoBERTa consistently achieve strong results, tool effectiveness remains
context-dependent. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners in
selecting trustworthy tools for sentiment analysis in software engineering,
while highlighting the need for ongoing evaluation as communication contexts
evolve.

### [247] [Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02182)
*Fangjian Lei,Jiawen Liu,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou,Derek Truong,William Alexander*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of maintaining COBOL systems by proposing a multi-agent LLM approach to improve code explanation, achieving notable improvements in various evaluation metrics across function, file, and project levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the difficulty of maintaining COBOL codebases due to aging technology, declining developer expertise, and the lack of proper documentation, compounded by the architectural and syntactical challenges COBOL presents to modern LLMs.

Method: The authors proposed a multi-agent framework utilizing two interacting LLM-based agents that integrate contextual information from a COBOL codebase to generate explanations for functions, files, and project-level aspects.

Result: The approach demonstrated significant improvements over the baseline in explaining COBOL code with better scores in METEOR, chrF, SentenceBERT, and higher effectiveness in explaining long files and project-level functionalities.

Conclusion: The multi-agent LLM approach is a promising solution for enhancing the maintainability of legacy COBOL systems by generating accurate and context-aware code explanations at various scales.

Abstract: Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to
develop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,
and government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of
COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly
challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for
new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing
research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of
code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its
architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed
the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach
that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate
explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents
incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into
the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach
using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our
approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code
explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,
chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach
effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token
window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in
explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated
explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that
convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.

### [248] [VeFIA: An Efficient Inference Auditing Framework for Vertical Federated Collaborative Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02376)
*Chung-ju Huang,Ziqi Zhang,Yinggui Wang,Binghui Wang,Tao Wei,Leye Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes VeFIA, a framework for ensuring correctness in Vertical Federated Learning inference software execution without compromising data privacy or adding latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to ensure the execution correctness of inference software in Vertical Federated Learning systems, which is currently lacking in existing work.

Method: VeFIA uses a combination of Trusted Execution Environments and a coordinator to validate the correctness of inference results without leaking private data or introducing extra latency.

Result: VeFIA can detect execution anomalies with 99.99% probability if abnormal inferences exceed 5.4%, and achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and true positive rate.

Conclusion: VeFIA is a novel solution for auditing the correctness of VFL inference software while preserving data privacy and inference system performance.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

### [249] [Precisely Detecting Python Type Errors via LLM-based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02318)
*Chen Yang,Ziqi Wang,Yanjie Jiang,Lin Yang,Yuteng Zheng,Jianyi Zhou,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RTED is a novel approach targeting Python type errors by integrating type constraint analysis and reflective validation for better test generation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and discovery of new issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Type errors in Python can cause runtime failures, reducing reliability and productivity. Existing static checks have high false positives, and test generation methods can miss bugs without guidance.

Method: RTED uses step-by-step type constraint analysis and reflective validation to create more accurate and guided tests, reducing false positives while finding more errors.

Result: RTED detected 22-29 more type errors compared to other methods, reduced false positives by 173.9%-245.9% in precision, and identified 12 new type errors in open-source projects.

Conclusion: RTED significantly improves Python type error detection and precision, advancing state-of-the-art test generation and reducing runtime issues in practice.

Abstract: Type errors in Python often lead to runtime failures, posing significant
challenges to software reliability and developer productivity. Existing static
analysis tools aim to detect such errors without execution but frequently
suffer from high false positive rates. Recently, unit test generation
techniques offer great promise in achieving high test coverage, but they often
struggle to produce bug-revealing tests without tailored guidance. To address
these limitations, we present RTED, a novel type-aware test generation
technique for automatically detecting Python type errors. Specifically, RTED
combines step-by-step type constraint analysis with reflective validation to
guide the test generation process and effectively suppress false positives. We
evaluated RTED on two widely-used benchmarks, BugsInPy and TypeBugs.
Experimental results show that RTED can detect 22-29 more benchmarked type
errors than four state-of-the-art techniques. RTED is also capable of producing
fewer false positives, achieving an improvement of 173.9%-245.9% in precision.
Furthermore, RTED successfully discovered 12 previously unknown type errors
from six real-world open-source Python projects.

### [250] [Meta-Fair: AI-Assisted Fairness Testing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02533)
*Miguel Romero-Arjona,José A. Parejo,Juan C. Alonso,Ana B. Sánchez,Aitor Arrieta,Sergio Segura*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study introduces Meta-Fair, a novel automated method for fairness testing in large language models (LLMs), using metamorphic testing and LLM-driven tools to uncover biases. Results show high precision and promise for automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness remains a core issue in AI system development, but current fairness testing methods are resource-intensive, manual, and challenging to scale. A new method is required to assess and ensure fairness efficiently.

Method: The authors propose Meta-Fair, utilizing metamorphic testing for bias detection by analyzing model responses to controlled input changes. It also uses LLMs for test case generation and evaluation, supported by open-source tools.

Result: Meta-Fair successfully detects bias in LLMs with an average precision of 92%. It reveals biased behavior in 29% of executions and demonstrates that LLMs can reliably evaluate outcomes, with some achieving F1-scores of 0.79.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effectiveness of automated fairness testing through Meta-Fair, marking significant progress towards scalable and efficient bias detection in LLMs despite challenges needing further attention.

Abstract: Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult
to assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language
models (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic
heuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult
to scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method
for testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific
resources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,
Meta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to
uncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled
modifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,
we propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and
output evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and
classify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source
tools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test
cases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained
LLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.
The results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,
achieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of
executions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,
with the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although
non-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through
careful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the
results indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation
in LLM testing.

### [251] [LLMREI: Automating Requirements Elicitation Interviews with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02564)
*Alexander Korn,Samuel Gorsch,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents LLMREI, a chatbot designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human intervention, demonstrating promising results in automated elicitation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Requirements elicitation interviews are resource-intensive, prone to human errors and biases, and advancements in Large Language Models open opportunities for improving automation and reducing these challenges.

Method: The study tested LLMREI using zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting in 33 simulated stakeholder interviews, evaluating its effectiveness in minimizing errors, extracting requirements, and adapting to contexts.

Result: LLMREI performed comparably to human interviewers in making errors, successfully extracted a substantial amount of requirements, and showed strong adaptability in context-aware questioning.

Conclusion: LLMREI shows potential in automating requirements elicitation, especially in scenarios involving interviews with numerous stakeholders, thus enhancing scalability and reducing human dependencies.

Abstract: Requirements elicitation interviews are crucial for gathering system
requirements but heavily depend on skilled analysts, making them
resource-intensive, susceptible to human biases, and prone to miscommunication.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models present new opportunities for
automating parts of this process. This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot
designed to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human
intervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the
scalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,
zero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for
requirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated
stakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered
but abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses
the chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview
errors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on
interview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a
similar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of
extracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability
to generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest
benefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates challenges in achieving effective Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) for Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems, focusing on feedback loop integration and human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in integrating humans into adaptive feedback loops of CPS and ensure respect for human ethics and privacy in Human-Machine Teaming.

Method: (1) Developing human-machine interaction methods for HMT integration into CPS feedback loops. (2) Creating frameworks for embedding ethics and human values throughout the system lifecycle.

Result: Proposed approaches to incorporate HMT into CPS and frameworks to validate ethics and values in system operations.

Conclusion: The research advances HMT in adaptive CPS by enabling better integration of humans into feedback loops while considering ethics and human values.

Abstract: Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that integrate both
physical and computational capabilities, which can adjust in response to
changing parameters. Furthermore, they increasingly incorporate human-machine
collaboration, allowing them to benefit from the individual strengths of humans
and machines. Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) represents the most advanced paradigm
of human-machine collaboration, envisioning seamless teamwork between humans
and machines. However, achieving effective and seamless HMT in adaptive CPS is
challenging. While adaptive CPS already benefit from feedback loops such as
MAPE-K, there is still a gap in integrating humans into these feedback loops
due to different operational cadences of humans and machines. Further, HMT
requires constant monitoring of human operators, collecting potentially
sensitive information about their actions and behavior. Respecting the privacy
and human values of the actors of the CPS is crucial for the success of
human-machine teams. This research addresses these challenges by: (1)
developing novel methods and processes for integrating HMT into adaptive CPS,
focusing on human-machine interaction principles and their incorporation into
adaptive feedback loops found in CPS, and (2) creating frameworks for
integrating, verifying, and validating ethics and human values throughout the
system lifecycle, starting from requirements engineering.

Result: Preliminary findings highlight opportunities for collaboration and mutual learning, suggesting a methodology for future validation and extension with crowd-sourced participation.

Conclusion: Bridging the terminology gap can enhance collaboration and foster knowledge exchange between RSE and SER communities.

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and
Software Engineering Researchers (SERs) often use different terminologies for
similar concepts, creating communication challenges. To better understand these
divergences, we have started investigating how SE fundamentals from the SER
community are interpreted within the RSE community, identifying aligned

*Jiaxing Wang,Yifeng Yu,Jiahan Song,Bin Cao,Jing Fan,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLHGNN, a framework for next activity prediction in business processes leveraging heterogeneous process graphs and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing methods for next activity prediction in service-oriented architectures fail to capture non-sequential or complex relationships effectively, being either too linear or overly simplistic.

Method: They propose RLHGNN, which employs graph-based modeling using heterogeneous process graphs with distinct edge types, and reinforcement learning to determine the optimal graph structure for specific processes. Additionally, it uses heterogeneous graph convolution for precise predictions.

Result: RLHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets and achieves efficient inference with about 1 ms latency per prediction.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-time business process monitoring, balancing precision and performance.

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

*Sahar Ahmadisakha,Lech Bialek,Mohamed Soliman,Vasilios Andrikopoulos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'sustainability flags' as a method to identify sustainability-related content in cloud architecture Q&A discussions, showing improved effectiveness over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying sustainability concepts in software practitioners' discussions, particularly in cloud architecture, due to the absence of clear guidelines.

Method: Thematic analysis of sustainability best practices from cloud providers was used to develop sustainability flags, which were tested in a controlled experiment on cloud architecture posts.

Result: The use of sustainability flags classifies fewer posts as sustainability-related but achieves moderately higher certainty and significantly better performance compared to a control group.

Conclusion: Sustainability flags are more effective and understandable than traditional methods, aiding in identifying sustainability-related discussions among software practitioners.

Abstract: In recent years, sustainability in software systems has gained significant
attention, especially with the rise of cloud computing and the shift towards
cloud-based architectures. This shift has intensified the need to identify
sustainability in architectural discussions to take informed architectural
decisions. One source to see these decisions is in online Q&A forums among
practitioners' discussions. However, recognizing sustainability concepts within
software practitioners' discussions remains challenging due to the lack of
clear and distinct guidelines for this task. To address this issue, we
introduce the notion of sustainability flags as pointers in relevant
discussions, developed through thematic analysis of multiple sustainability
best practices from cloud providers. This study further evaluates the
effectiveness of these flags in identifying sustainability within cloud
architecture posts, using a controlled experiment. Preliminary results suggest
that the use of flags results in classifying fewer posts as
sustainability-related compared to a control group, with moderately higher
certainty and significantly improved performance. Moreover, sustainability
flags are perceived as more useful and understandable than relying solely on
definitions for identifying sustainability.

### [256] [Legal Requirements Translation from Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02846)
*Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of extracting legal metadata for software compliance by proposing an automated method that generates encodable Python representations of legal text, tested with high precision on U.S. laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small organizations often struggle with legal compliance due to resource constraints, making automated extraction of legal requirements crucial.

Method: The approach involves textual entailment and in-context learning to create a canonical Python representation from a domain-specific metamodel based on structural and semantic metadata.

Result: The proposed method achieves 89.4% success in test cases, with precision at 82.2% and recall at 88.7%, evaluated on various U.S. state breach laws.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable and efficient method for automating legal metadata extraction, reducing manual effort and enhancing applicability across diverse legislative texts.

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

*Yuchen Shen,Anmol Singhal,Travis Breaux*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to assist interviewers in generating follow-up questions during software requirements elicitation, finding that LLM-generated questions are comparable or better than human-authored ones under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interviewing stakeholders to derive software requirements often challenges interviewers due to factors like unfamiliarity with the domain, cognitive load, and overwhelming information. This paper aims to provide support to interviewers by leveraging LLMs to improve interview question quality, particularly by mitigating common interviewing mistakes.

Method: The researchers utilized GPT-4 to generate follow-up interview questions, both with and without specific guidance based on common interviewer mistake types. Two controlled experiments were conducted: one comparing unguided LLM-generated questions to human-authored ones, and another evaluating LLM-guided questions based on mistake types.

Result: The results showed that unguided LLM-generated questions were comparable to human-authored ones regarding clarity, relevancy, and informativeness. Guided LLM-generated questions outperformed human-authored questions when tailored to address interviewer mistake types.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4 can effectively support real-time interview question generation, aiding interviewers in overcoming challenges during requirements elicitation while potentially improving the overall quality of the interviews.

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

*Guobin Shen,Dongcheng Zhao,Yiting Dong,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper studies the convergence between human brain activity and AI model representations, showing that optimizing for task performance naturally aligns with brain-like computational strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if higher-performing AI systems naturally develop brain-like representations and explore clues for intelligent information processing and better AI systems.

Method: Large-scale analysis comparing human brain activity and internal representations of 600+ AI models in language and vision domains, involving 60 million alignment measurements.

Result: Higher-performing AI models show stronger alignment with brain activity; language models have a higher correlation than vision models, and brain alignment precedes performance improvement during training.

Conclusion: AI optimization aligns with brain-like computation, offering insights into intelligence and guiding AI development toward higher capabilities.

Abstract: Artificial and biological systems may evolve similar computational solutions
despite fundamental differences in architecture and learning mechanisms -- a
form of convergent evolution. We demonstrate this phenomenon through
large-scale analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal
representations of over 600 AI models spanning language and vision domains,
from 1.33M to 72B parameters. Analyzing 60 million alignment measurements
reveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain
alignment without explicit neural constraints, with language models showing
markedly stronger correlation (r=0.89, p<7.5e-13) than vision models (r=0.53,
p<2.0e-44). Crucially, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that brain alignment
consistently precedes performance improvements during training, suggesting that
developing brain-like representations may be a necessary stepping stone toward
higher capabilities. We find systematic patterns: language models exhibit
strongest alignment with limbic and integrative regions, while vision models
show progressive alignment with visual cortices; deeper processing layers
converge across modalities; and as representational scale increases, alignment
systematically shifts from primary sensory to higher-order associative regions.
These findings provide compelling evidence that optimization for task
performance naturally drives AI systems toward brain-like computational
strategies, offering both fundamental insights into principles of intelligent
information processing and practical guidance for developing more capable AI
systems.

Conclusion: While recursive, self-referential design improves AI capabilities, it does not equate to consciousness or merit granting moral status.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether contemporary AI architectures employing deep
recursion, meta-learning, and self-referential mechanisms provide evidence of
machine consciousness. Integrating philosophical history, cognitive science,
and AI engineering, it situates recursive algorithms within a lineage spanning
Cartesian dualism, Husserlian intentionality, Integrated Information Theory,
the Global Workspace model, and enactivist perspectives. The argument proceeds
through textual analysis, comparative architecture review, and synthesis of
neuroscience findings on integration and prediction. Methodologically, the
study combines conceptual analysis, case studies, and normative risk assessment
informed by phenomenology and embodied cognition. Technical examples, including
transformer self-attention, meta-cognitive agents, and neuromorphic chips,
illustrate how functional self-modeling can arise without subjective
experience. By distinguishing functional from phenomenal consciousness, the
paper argues that symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia remain
unresolved barriers to attributing sentience to current AI. Ethical analysis
explores risks of premature anthropomorphism versus neglect of future sentient
systems; legal implications include personhood, liability, authorship, and
labor impacts. Future directions include quantum architectures, embodied
robotics, unsupervised world modeling, and empirical tests for non-biological
phenomenality. The study reframes the "hard problem" as a graded and
increasingly testable phenomenon, rather than a metaphysical impasse. It
concludes that recursive self-referential design enhances capability but does
not entail consciousness or justify moral status. Keywords: Recursive
algorithms; self-reference; machine consciousness; AI ethics; AI consciousness

### [260] [REMI: Reconstructing Episodic Memory During Intrinsic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02064)
*Zhaoze Wang,Genela Morris,Dori Derdikman,Pratik Chaudhari,Vijay Balasubramanian*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how grid cells and place cells jointly enable goal-directed planning and produce testable predictions about their role in navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grid and place cells encode spatial information in different ways, yet it is unclear why animals maintain both representations.

Method: The work uses computational modeling, including a single-layer RNN, to study how the HC-MEC loop supports goal recall and grid-cell-based planning.

Result: The proposed model shows that place cells can retrieve grid patterns for goal recall and plan paths by sequentially updating grid states, producing intermediate reconstructions of experiences.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a functional distinction for the co-existence of grid and place cells that supports navigation and planning, and the model makes testable predictions about this relationship.

Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are believed to path
integrate speed and direction signals to activate at triangular grids of
locations in an environment, thus implementing a population code for position.
In parallel, place cells in the hippocampus (HC) fire at spatially confined
locations, with selectivity tuned not only to allocentric position but also to
environmental contexts, such as sensory cues. Although grid and place cells
both encode spatial information and support memory for multiple locations, why
animals maintain two such representations remains unclear. Noting that place
representations seem to have other functional roles in intrinsically motivated
tasks such as recalling locations from sensory cues, we propose that animals
maintain grid and place representations together to support planning.
Specifically, we posit that place cells auto-associate not only sensory
information relayed from the MEC but also grid cell patterns, enabling recall
of goal location grid patterns from sensory and motivational cues, permitting
subsequent planning with only grid representations. We extend a previous
theoretical framework for grid-cell-based planning and show that local
transition rules can generalize to long-distance path forecasting. We further
show that a planning network can sequentially update grid cell states toward
the goal. During this process, intermediate grid activity can trigger place
cell pattern completion, reconstructing experiences along the planned path. We
demonstrate all these effects using a single-layer RNN that simultaneously
models the HC-MEC loop and the planning subnetwork. We show that such recurrent
mechanisms for grid cell-based planning, with goal recall driven by the place
system, make several characteristic, testable predictions.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for decoding behavior based on brain-wide neural recordings in larval zebrafish.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding how behavior arises from large-scale neural activity, particularly in complex mammalian brains, by leveraging LLMs with established capabilities for sequence-to-sequence learning and neural decoding.

Method: The study used pre-trained LLMs (termed NLP4Neuro) to decode behavior from simultaneous calcium imaging and behavioral recordings in larval zebrafish and tested models like DeepSeek Coder-7b for behavioral decoding tasks.

Result: The pre-trained LLMs, particularly DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved the decoding of behavior, produced interpretable neuron salience, and achieved anatomically consistent results with high accuracy in predicting tail movements over extended timescales.

Conclusion: LLMs pre-trained on natural language data are effective tools for understanding brain-wide neural activity, enabling detailed insights into neural circuit mechanisms underlying behavior.

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

*Kai Chen,Zhong-qi K. Tian,Yifei Chen,Songting Li,Douglas Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for structural connectivity inference called "pairwise time-delayed transfer entropy" (PTD-TE), which overcomes dimensionality issues and improves accuracy and robustness in reconstructing network connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of high-dimensional probability estimation and the inadequately understood relationship between inferred causal connectivity and underlying structural connectivity in existing methods such as transfer entropy.

Method: The authors propose PTD-TE, which is theoretically established to have a quadratic relationship with node coupling strengths, making it immune to dimensionality issues. The method is tested on biological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and electrophysiological data.

Result: PTD-TE achieves consistent and high-performance network reconstructions, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness against noise in various network systems.

Conclusion: PTD-TE is a scalable, model-agnostic approach for inferring structural connectivity in nonlinear real-world networks, proving its broad applicability and reliability across disciplines.

Abstract: Analyzing network structural connectivity is crucial for understanding
dynamics and functions of complex networks across disciplines. In many
networks, structural connectivity is not observable, which requires to be
inferred via causal inference methods. Among them, transfer entropy (TE) is one
of the most broadly applied causality measure due to its model-free property.
However, TE often faces the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional
probability estimation, and the relation between the inferred causal
connectivity and the underlying structural connectivity remains poorly
understood. Here we address these issues by proposing a pairwise time-delayed
transfer entropy (PTD-TE) method. We theoretically establish a quadratic
relationship between PTD-TE values and node coupling strengths, and demonstrate
its immunity to dimensionality issues and broad applicability. Tests on
biological neuronal networks, nonlinear physical systems, and
electrophysiological data show PTD-TE achieves consistent, high-performance
reconstructions. Compared to a bunch of existing approaches for network
connectivity reconstruction, PTD-TE outperforms these methods across various
network systems in accuracy and robustness against noise. Our framework
provides a scalable, model-agnostic tool for structural connectivity inference
in nonlinear real-world networks.

*Kai Chen,Mingzhang Wang,Songting Li,Douglas Zhou*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a new framework combining change point detection (CPD) and time-delayed correlation coefficient (TDCC) methods to accurately reconstruct dynamic neuronal networks, addressing structural changes over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to reconstruct dynamic neural network structures due to the complexity of brain connectivity and ongoing modifications via synaptic plasticity.

Method: A unified framework integrates connectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with time-delayed correlation coefficient (TDCC) analysis to detect structural changes and segment neuronal recordings for reconstruction.

Result: The CPD-TDCC framework proves effective in handling both dynamic topology changes and synaptic weight variations, validated through simulations of various neuronal models with sparse network data.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges a critical gap by enabling accurate network reconstruction in dynamically changing structures, offering significant potential for experimental neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics and functions critically depends on knowledge of
the network connectivity among neurons. However, the complexity of brain
structural connectivity, coupled with continuous modifications driven by
synaptic plasticity, makes its direct experimental measurement particularly
challenging. Conventional connectivity inference methods based on neuronal
recordings often assumes a static underlying structural connectivity and
requires stable statistical features of neural activities, making them
unsuitable for reconstructing structural connectivity that undergoes changes.
To fulfill the needs of reconstructing networks undergoing potential structural
changes, we propose a unified network reconstruction framework that combines
connectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with pairwise time-delayed
correlation coefficient (TDCC) method. For general neuronal networks in
balanced regimes, we develop a theoretical analysis for discriminating changes
in structural connectivity based on the fluctuation of neuronal voltage time
series. We then demonstrate a pairwise TDCC method to reconstruct the network
using spike train recordings segmented at the detected change points. We show
the effectiveness of our CPD-TDCC network reconstruction using large-scale
network simulations with multiple neuronal models. Crucially, our method
accommodates networks with changes in both network topologies and synaptic
coupling strengths while retaining accuracy even with sparsely sampled
subnetwork data, achieving a critical advancement for practical applications in
real experimental situations. Our CPD-TDCC framework addresses the critical gap
in network reconstruction by accounting connectivity-induced changes points,
potentially offering a valuable tool for studying structure and dynamics in the
cortical brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper develops a mathematical theory of consciousness based on neurochemical dynamics, utilizing clinical data from Parkinson's disease patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a coherent, measurable framework for understanding consciousness using mathematical models and neurochemical interactions.

Method: The authors use mathematical modeling combined with clinical analysis of Parkinson’s disease data to study dopamine and serotonin's roles in consciousness.

Result: A significant interaction between LEDD (dopaminergic input) and UPDRS (system integrity) was found, supporting non-linear, state-dependent dynamics.

Conclusion: Consciousness operates as a non-monotonic function in neurochemical space, influenced by dopamine and serotonin. The framework explains various conscious states and anomalies effectively.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theory of consciousness grounded in
mathematical formalism and supported by clinical data analysis. The framework
developed herein demonstrates that consciousness exists as a continuous,
non-monotonic function across a high-dimensional neurochemical space, with
dopamine serving as the primary intensity regulator and serotonin (5-HT2A) as
the complexity modulator. This work offers mechanistic explanations for the
full spectrum of conscious states, from deep sleep and psychosis to the
ultimate collapse in neural death. The theory explains paradoxical phenomena
such as prefrontal cortex hypoactivity during seizures, the evolutionary
persistence of psychosis-prone individuals, and why controlled administration
of classical 5-HT2A agonists shows a comparatively low incidence of serious
medical events (< 0.01 % in modern clinical trials), while dopaminergic excess
proves rapidly lethal. The framework is tested using 70,290 sleep nights from
242 Parkinson's disease patients, using disease severity (UPDRS) as a proxy for
system integrity and medication (LEDD) as a proxy for dopaminergic input. The
analysis reveals a significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction (beta=-1.7, p<.0001),
confirming the model's prediction of state-dependent, non-linear dynamics.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the adaptive ISTA algorithm theoretically by examining its fixed points' properties and convergence behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of theoretical understanding of adaptive ISTA, a popular algorithm for LASSO problems.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical study of adaptive ISTA with the noise estimation strategy of median absolute deviation to analyze fixed points' properties and convergence guarantees.

Result: They identify fixed point properties such as scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, and provide proofs for local linear convergence and global convergence behavior.

Conclusion: The findings extend theoretical insights into the adaptive ISTA, showcasing its convergence behaviors and overall robustness in solving LASSO problems.

Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular
algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without
explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the
adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results
exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA
with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute
deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including
scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear
convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating conditional expectations fail in heavily polluted data environments, necessitating a solution tailored for large noise scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid algorithm combining Christoffel sampling and optimal experimental design. It is extended to convex-constrained settings and uses adaptive random subspaces for targeting functions defined as expectations of random fields.

Result: The proposed algorithm improves computational efficiency and sample complexity, with appropriate optimality properties validated by numerical studies on synthetic data and computational finance simulations.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively handles noisy data and provides robust theoretical guarantees, showcasing versatility in both standard and convex-constrained settings.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive
random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the
adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies
on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem
in computational finance.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of transfer learning to enhance matrix completion by leveraging favorable auxiliary data, achieving minimax optimality and faster convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the estimation of low-rank target matrices by utilizing auxiliary source datasets and addressing challenges of source relevance and optimality under a transfer learning framework.

Method: The method includes proposing a transfer learning procedure with prior information on favorable source datasets, utilizing advanced sharp concentration inequalities, and developing a detection procedure to identify informative sources.

Result: The proposed method achieves faster convergence rates, proves minimax optimality, and outperforms traditional single target data-based methods when sources are sufficiently similar to the target. Its selection consistency is also demonstrated.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that leveraging auxiliary data through effective transfer learning can enhance matrix completion. The developed detection approach ensures the reliability of the method in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the
validity of our methodology.

*Jikai Jin,Lester Mackey,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores causal inference with black-box machine learning, finding that the effectiveness of treatment effect estimation depends heavily on treatment noise distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve causal inference methods and resolve existing shortcomings in estimating treatment effects given nuisance function errors.

Method: The paper analyzes the partially linear model, evaluates the widely-used double machine learning (DML) estimator, introduces higher-order robust procedures (ACE) based on cumulant estimators, and tests methods via synthetic experiments.

Result: DML is optimal for Gaussian treatment noise but suboptimal for non-Gaussian noise. New ACE procedures outperform DML by offering higher-order robustness.

Conclusion: Higher-order robust estimators improve causal inference, especially for non-Gaussian noise, and the paper establishes theoretical foundations and practical benefits.

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancements to sparse variational Gaussian processes using block-diagonal scaling, showing improved performance and flexibility without added computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up Gaussian Process models is difficult, and the accuracy of sparse variational methods can be improved. The paper aims to address limitations in current practices by refining posterior approximations and leveraging these enhancements within the unified Power Expectation Propagation (PEP) framework.

Method: The paper integrates a block-diagonal structure into the conditional posterior and adapts this within the PEP framework to assess effectiveness through performance improvements.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed block-diagonal structure outperforms diagonal approximations while maintaining computational efficiency. The updated PEP framework also shows strong performance under diverse configurations.

Conclusion: The block-diagonal posterior approximation and integration with PEP enhance scalability, accuracy, and flexibility in Gaussian Process models, making it a strong alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of multimodal large language models (LLMs) to conduct usability evaluations, demonstrating their cost-effectiveness and identifying strengths in issues detection compared to human evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centered design usability evaluations are often resource-intensive; thus, exploring synthetic methods using advanced AI tools could reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Method: Authors created a synthetic heuristic evaluation model employing multimodal LLMs to analyze design images and generate feedback, comparing performance with human UX practitioners on usability issues in two apps.

Result: Synthetic evaluations identified 73% and 77% of usability issues in comparison to human evaluators' 57% and 63%, showcasing strengths in detecting layout issues while being less adept in some UI conventions and across-screen violations.

Conclusion: Synthetic evaluations using multimodal LLMs show promise in improving performance consistency and detecting layout-specific problems, with challenges in broader UI recognition and across-screen violations, offering valuable insights for enhancing AI-driven design feedback methods.

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

TL;DR: The paper examines how large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini generate emotionally rich interactions, highlighting areas for improvement in empathy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the emotional intelligence and empathetic listening ability of conversational agents as they become more integral in domains like healthcare and education.

Method: The study used a manually crafted empathic interaction dataset, extended with dialogues generated by ChatGPT and Gemini. Sentiment analysis and expert evaluation were employed to assess emotional progression.

Result: Generated conversations aligned structurally with intended emotional patterns but showed gaps in empathy and coherence according to human evaluations.

Conclusion: Emotion modeling for conversational agents must combine automated metrics with expert insights to achieve qualitative depth and emotional competency.

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how data scientists create proxy target variables for predictive modeling of abstract concepts, such as student writing authenticity and patient healthcare needs, through interviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scientists face challenges in operationalizing abstract and fuzzy concepts into measurable, predictive target variables, which is critical for effective modeling in fields like education and healthcare.

Method: Fifteen data scientists, split between education and healthcare sectors, are interviewed to understand their process of target variable construction for predictive modeling.

Result: A bricolage process is identified, where data scientists balance five criteria—validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and resource requirements—through iterative negotiation and adaptive (re)formulation strategies.

Conclusion: Future research opportunities arise in improving HCI, CSCW, and ML methodologies to better support the nuanced process of target variable construction among data scientists.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

Motivation: The study aims to address computational inefficiency in finding optimal codewords for mmWave MIMO systems, especially with obstructed paths and multipath effects.

Method: The authors employ permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors for codebook design and develop a trained deep neural network (DNN) to mitigate computational challenges in precoding.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the DNN achieves sub-optimal spectral efficiency, even under varying distances between the user and the RIS.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of using DNNs to improve spectral efficiency and reduce computation time in RIS-aided mmWave MIMO systems.

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of rigid and fixed-curvature embeddings while improving recommendation transparency, diversity, and reasoning in sparse or abstract domains.

Method: Develop a probabilistic geometric recommender system using adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres and a curvature-aware semantic kernel.

Result: Achieved superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity metrics compared to existing methods across four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ManifoldMind enhances recommendation systems with personalized uncertainty modeling and transparent reasoning, overcoming conventional limitations in sparse semantic hierarchies.

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or

### [275] [Why Multi-Interest Fairness Matters: Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02000)
*Yongsen Zheng,Zongxuan Xie,Guohua Wang,Ziyao Liu,Liang Lin,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Unfairness in recommender systems, often linked to attributes like gender or popularity, worsens over time and creates challenges like echo chambers. The HyFairCRS framework introduces hypergraph contrastive multi-interest learning to enhance fairness and diversity in conversational systems. Experiments show state-of-the-art outcomes and reduced biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address persistent and worsening unfairness in recommender systems, including the Matthew effect and filter bubbles, particularly in dynamic and interactive contexts.

Method: HyFairCRS uses hypergraph-based contrastive learning to identify diverse user interests, employing these in conversational systems to ensure fair item recommendations within a feedback loop.

Result: Experiments on CRS datasets demonstrate that HyFairCRS outperforms existing methods and significantly reduces unfairness in recommendations.

Conclusion: HyFairCRS provides an effective solution for enhancing multi-interest diversity and fairness in dynamic conversational recommender systems, setting a new benchmark in both performance and fairness.

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

### [276] [When LLMs Disagree: Diagnosing Relevance Filtering Bias and Retrieval Divergence in SDG Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02139)
*William A. Ingram,Bipasha Banerjee,Edward A. Fox*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of labeling disagreements between Large Language Models (LLMs) in document retrieval tasks, focusing on scholarly abstracts related to Sustainable Development Goals. Disagreement is systematic and characterized by specific patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is concern about how labeling disagreements between different LLMs impact document relevance judgments, particularly in domains without human-labeled data.

Method: The authors analyze disagreements between two LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, assessing lexical patterns, rank-order behavior, and using classification tools with AUC above 0.74.

Result: Labeling disagreements are found to be consistent and systematic, not random, and linked to structured variability in document ranking.

Conclusion: Using classification disagreement as an analytical tool can improve retrieval evaluations, especially in policy-driven thematic searches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

*Terence Zeng,Abhishek K. Umrawal*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper reviews recommendation system challenges in music platforms, focusing on data sparsity. It discusses content filtering methods like LLMs for lyrics and audio processing techniques to complement collaborative filtering approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of collaborative filtering in music recommendation systems due to data sparsity and introduce complementary methods.

Method: The paper reviews the application of LLMs for lyrical analysis and audio signal processing techniques for song classification in music recommendation systems.

Result: Highlight the potential and conflicts of combining lyrical and audio analysis for recommendation systems, while proposing ways to resolve these conflicts.

Conclusion: Content filtering methods can effectively address limitations in collaborative filtering for music recommendation systems, though challenges between multi-modal approaches need resolution for optimal results.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

### [278] [Listwise Preference Alignment Optimization for Tail Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02255)
*Zihao Li,Chao Yang,Tong Zhang,Yakun Chen,Xianzhi Wang,Guandong Xu,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPO4Rec, a method to enhance preference alignment for recommendation systems, focusing on tail-item recommendations by optimizing listwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are inefficiencies in existing preference alignment methods, particularly for tail-item recommendations, due to reliance on explicit reward modeling or pairwise preference comparison.

Method: LPO4Rec uses an extended Bradley-Terry model for listwise comparisons and introduces an adaptive negative sampling strategy to optimize tail-item recommendations.

Result: LPO4Rec leads to up to 50% improvement in recommendation performance, reducing GPU memory usage by 17.9% compared to direct preference optimization (DPO).

Conclusion: The proposed method improves efficiency and performance in tail-item recommendations by avoiding explicit reward modeling and enhancing training strategies.

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Yuhanleeee/LPO4Rec.

*Colin Rothgang,Florian Rabe*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper extends the dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) with refinement and quotient types by leveraging its already undecidable type system and seamless translation to higher-order logic (HOL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance DHOL with commonly requested refinement and quotient types, which are rarely supported by automated theorem provers due to their inherent undecidability.

Method: Introduce refinement and quotient types as special cases of subtyping, utilizing identity maps for canonical inclusion and projection to integrate these types into DHOL efficiently.

Result: The extended language includes refinement and quotient types, with soundness and completeness proven through its translation to HOL.

Conclusion: Integrating refinement and quotient types in DHOL demonstrates that the design of the framework can effectively enhance expressiveness without sacrificing automated theorem proving capabilities.

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

*Craig S Wright*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper revises the traditional CAP theorem by introducing an automata-theoretic and economic framework, offering a model to balance consistency and availability within bounded margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the classical CAP theorem's claim that consistency and availability cannot be simultaneously preserved, and propose a framework to overcome its limits.

Method: Distributed systems are modeled as partition-aware state machines with economic incentive layers and game-theoretic mechanisms to stabilize consensus behavior and define provable bounds on system properties.

Result: The study shows that both availability and consistency can be maintained simultaneously within quantifiable margins under their proposed model.

Conclusion: By applying formal economic controls and automata theory, the paper extends the traditional CAP theorem, demonstrating that its trade-offs can be optimized beyond classical limits.

Abstract: The CAP theorem asserts a trilemma between consistency, availability, and
partition tolerance. This paper introduces a rigorous automata-theoretic and
economically grounded framework that reframes the CAP trade-off as a constraint
optimization problem. We model distributed systems as partition-aware state
machines and embed economic incentive layers to stabilize consensus behavior
across adversarially partitioned networks. By incorporating game-theoretic
mechanisms into the global transition semantics, we define provable bounds on
convergence, liveness, and correctness. Our results demonstrate that
availability and consistency can be simultaneously preserved within bounded
epsilon margins, effectively extending the classical CAP limits through formal
economic control.

### [281] [Learning to Coordinate Bidders in Non-Truthful Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02801)
*Hu Fu,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores learning Bayes correlated equilibria (BCE) in non-truthful auctions like first-price and all-pay auctions, demonstrating a polynomial sample complexity for doing so.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing Bayes Nash equilibria in non-truthful auctions is difficult and can lead to undesirable outcomes. To improve such auction systems, this paper looks at using mediators for implementing BCE, which requires learning from incomplete information about bidders' private valuations.

Method: The paper develops a technique using sample-based estimation of bidders' expected utilities, alongside analyzing the pseudo-dimension of their monotone bidding strategies, to study the sample complexity of BCE learning.

Result: The authors show that BCEs in first-price and all-pay auctions can be learned with a polynomial number of samples, specifically $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$, from the bidders' value distributions.

Conclusion: The findings provide a practical framework for implementing BCE in non-truthful auctions without requiring complete knowledge of bidders' private valuations.

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

*Wangbin Ding,Lei Li,Junyi Qiu,Bogen Lin,Mingjing Yang,Liqin Huang,Lianming Wu,Sihan Wang,Xiahai Zhuang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CineMyoPS, a deep neural network for segmenting myocardial pathologies using cine cardiac MRI without contrast agents, enabling detailed analysis of MI-induced abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myocardial infarction is a major global health issue, and current diagnostic tools rely on imaging techniques that can be time-consuming or involve contrast agents, which may not be suitable for all patients. Developers were motivated to explore faster, contrast-free imaging methods like cine CMR to improve pathology segmentation.

Method: The authors developed CineMyoPS, which extracts motion and anatomical features from cine CMR images. A consistency loss mechanism and time-series aggregation are implemented to enhance segmentation of myocardial scars and edema across the cardiac cycle.

Result: Experimental analysis on multi-center datasets demonstrated that CineMyoPS performs effectively in segmenting myocardial pathologies, estimating myocardial motion, and delineating anatomy.

Conclusion: CineMyoPS is a promising tool for myocardial pathology segmentation, offering a fast, contrast-free imaging alternative for clinical risk stratification and MI prognosis assessment.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are
essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although
combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free
imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities
of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end
deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial
pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically,
CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given
the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss
(resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning.
Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate
MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation
accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center
dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial
pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.

*Christian Salomonsen,Luigi Tommaso Luppino,Fredrik Aspheim,Kristoffer Wickstrøm,Elisabeth Wetzer,Michael Kampffmeyer,Rodrigo Berzaghi,Rune Sundset,Robert Jenssen,Samuel Kuttner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fully convolutional deep learning model (FC-DLIF) for non-invasive input function prediction in small animal dynamic PET studies, eliminating the need for blood sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in arterial blood sampling for input function estimation in small animals, which involve invasive, time-intensive procedures unsuitable for longitudinal studies.

Method: The FC-DLIF model extracts spatial and temporal features from PET imaging data using a two-step deep learning approach: spatial feature extraction followed by temporal feature prediction of arterial input functions.

Result: FC-DLIF accurately predicts arterial input functions based on PET imaging across different conditions, showing robustness to truncated and shifted PET scan data. However, predictions fail for untrained radiotracers.

Conclusion: The model provides a reliable, non-invasive alternative to blood sampling for input functions in small animal PET studies, with limitations regarding radiotracer representation in training data.

Abstract: Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

*Zhurong Chen,Jinhua Chen,Wei Zhuo,Wufeng Xue,Dong Ni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for reconstructing personalized 3D heart models from 2D echocardiogram slices, significantly improving clinical parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D echocardiograms are limited in interpretation and accuracy for estimating clinical parameters, such as left ventricle volume, due to their dimensional constraints.

Method: A novel pipeline alternates between estimating 3D pose from 2D slices and integrating these slices using an implicit neural network to transform a prior 3D heart shape into a personalized model.

Result: The framework notably reduces error in left ventricle (LV) volume estimation (1.98% vs. 20.24% with the bi-plane method) and enables right ventricle (RV) volume estimation from 2D slices (error: 5.75%).

Conclusion: The study opens the possibility for personalized 3D heart structure and function analysis using 2D echocardiograms, with significant potential in clinical applications.

Abstract: Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MEGANet-W, which employs wavelet-driven edge guidance for better polyp segmentation, outperforming existing methods on five datasets without adding learnable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve colorectal polyp segmentation which faces challenges like weak and low-contrast boundaries.

Method: The study proposes MEGANet-W that incorporates Haar wavelet edge maps into decoder stages using Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (WEGA) modules for enhanced feature fusion.

Result: MEGANet-W outperforms existing methods by improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2% across five public datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging wavelet-driven attention significantly enhances segmentation accuracy without increasing model complexity, showcasing robust performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal
cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated
accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on
handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We
propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects
directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to
recalibrate semantic features. Our two main contributions are: (1) a two-level
Haar wavelet head for multi orientation edge extraction; and (2) Wavelet Edge
Guided Attention (WEGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with reverse and input
branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANetW consistently outperforms
existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while
introducing no additional learnable parameters.

*Linh Nguyen,Marcel Boersma,Erman Acar*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) approach that addresses fraud detection challenges such as sparsely labeled data and explainability in financial networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraud detection in the financial industry is costly and challenging, primarily due to sparsely labeled data and the need for explainability in ML models to meet regulatory standards.

Method: SAGE-FIN uses a semi-supervised GNN combined with Granger causal explanations to identify and explain fraudulent items within financial interaction networks.

Result: Empirical validation on the Elliptic++ financial network dataset shows that SAGE-FIN successfully flags fraudulent items and provides Granger-causal explanations without prior assumptions about the network.

Conclusion: SAGE-FIN proves to be an effective approach for fraud detection in financial networks, addressing key challenges like sparsely labeled data and regulatory explainability requirements.

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in detecting support and resistance (SR) levels in volatile markets, as traditional methods and recent machine learning approaches often prioritize price prediction over structural level identification.

Method: DeepSupp uses multi-head attention mechanisms to assess spatial correlations and market microstructure, creates dynamic correlation matrices for evolving market relations, employs an attention-based autoencoder, and extracts support levels via unsupervised clustering using DBSCAN.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate DeepSupp's superiority over six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six financial metrics, such as support accuracy and market regime sensitivity.

Conclusion: DeepSupp provides a robust and scalable solution for SR level detection, leveraging attention-based architectures to identify nuanced market patterns while enhancing technical trading strategies.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach
highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced
market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.

Method: They utilize LSTNet, a deep learning model for processing multivariate time series data on employment statistics, producing 7-day employment forecasts and an Industry Employment Health Index (IEHI).

Result: The approach surpasses baseline models in most industries, particularly stable ones, and aligns well with employment volatility, showcasing sector-specific performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves employment forecasting and industry health assessment, with potential areas for enhancements in interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for forecasting short-term employment

the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our system leverages a Long- and
Short-Term Time-series Network (LSTNet) to process multivariate time series

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in graph representation learning for financial applications and proposes a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) for long-term stock prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in leveraging corporate relationships for stock prediction and improve upon current methods' complexity and poor generalization.

Method: The authors propose a new graph learning task for long-term stock prediction and develop a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) optimized for financial datasets.

Result: The proposed NGAT model and task outperformed existing methods across two datasets, demonstrating superior effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work advances stock prediction by introducing a novel prediction task and a tailored model, emphasizing reproducibility and inviting future research.

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

### [291] [News Sentiment Embeddings for Stock Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01970)
*Ayaan Qayyum*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores using Wall Street Journal headlines with OpenAI-based text embeddings and PCA to predict SPY stock price movements, showing a 40% performance boost compared to models without headlines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve stock price prediction by leveraging the impact of news headlines, which are underexplored in traditional financial modeling.

Method: The method involves using OpenAI-based text embedding models to encode headlines, applying PCA for feature extraction, integrating additional financial indicators, and training over 390 machine learning models.

Result: The results show that incorporating headline embeddings enhances stock price prediction accuracy by at least 40%.

Conclusion: Incorporating news headline embeddings is effective in improving stock price prediction, demonstrating significant potential for integrating textual data in financial models.

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

### [292] [TubuleTracker: a high-fidelity shareware software to quantify angiogenesis architecture and maturity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02024)
*Danish Mahmood,Stephanie Buczkowski,Sahaj Shah,Autumn Anthony,Rohini Desetty,Carlo R Bartoli*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces tubuleTracker, a software tool that automates endothelial network analysis in angiogenesis studies, outperforming manual and ImageJ methods in speed, accuracy, and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Angiogenesis studies rely on endothelial cell culture analysis, which is traditionally manual and subjective, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. Existing tools like ImageJ are often slow and cannot fully capture network maturity. A better and faster tool is needed to overcome these shortcomings.

Method: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured and imaged under controlled conditions. Analysis was performed manually, via ImageJ, and tubuleTracker, measuring parameters like tubule count, total length, node count, area, and vessel circularity. Image maturity was independently rated by trained scientists on a 1-5 scale.

Result: TubuleTracker analyzed images in 6±2 seconds, compared to manual (8 min) and ImageJ (58±4 s), demonstrating a significant speed advantage. Its measurements strongly correlated with angiogenesis maturity scores, outperforming other methods in metrics like tubule count, length, node count, and vessel circularity.

Conclusion: TubuleTracker is a rapid, objective, and consistent tool for endothelial network analysis, offering significant improvements over traditional and existing automated methods. It is freely available to the biomedical research community.

Abstract: Background: In vitro endothelial cell culture is widely used to study
angiogenesis. Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed
manually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like
ImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as
endothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may
not fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed
tubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture
and maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired
using phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three
independent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics
included tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel
circularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis
maturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image
differed significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker
(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count
(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node
count (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across
angiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,
and circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more
consistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity
proved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker
is available as free shareware for the biomedical research community.

### [293] [Generating Large Semi-Synthetic Graphs of Any Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02166)
*Rodrigo Tuna,Carlos Soares*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: LGSG introduces a framework using diffusion models and node embeddings to address scalability and node attribute inclusion in graph generation, outperforming traditional methods on key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph generation methods are limited by node ID reliance, restricting graph scalability and neglecting node attributes.

Method: LGSG uses diffusion models and node embeddings to generate graphs of varying sizes without retraining, eliminating node ID dependency.

Result: LGSG matches baseline models in standard metrics and excels in clustering tendencies, maintaining consistent structural qualities regardless of graph size.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates robustness, scalability, and improved cluster tendencies, advancing flexible graph generation methodologies.

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

TL;DR: The paper showcases the use of transformer-based Neural Quantum States (NQS) to achieve breakthroughs in studying the 2D Hubbard model for quantum many-body systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the theoretical understanding of quantum many-body systems, particularly the 2D Hubbard model, which is critical for studying high-temperature superconductivity.

Method: Employing advanced transformer architectures and efficient optimization algorithms to model quantum correlations and entanglements effectively using NQS.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results for the 2D Hubbard model, identifying half-filled stripe ground states consistent with experimental data of cuprates.

Conclusion: Transformer-based NQS is validated as a powerful and efficient tool for studying quantum many-body systems, offering insights into challenging many-fermion systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging
many-fermions systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeSTA2.5-Audio, a Large Audio Language Model that maintains language skills while learning audio tasks without the need for task-specific tuning. A novel self-generated data strategy preserves the model's language proficiency, enabling state-of-the-art performance in various audio-language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) often lose their original language processing abilities when trained for audio tasks. The motivation is to create a model that retains its native language proficiency while excelling in audio perception and instruction-following.

Method: The authors propose DeSTA, a self-generated alignment strategy where the model generates its own training targets, preserving language skills. Using this, they create DeSTA-AQA5M, a dataset with 5 million samples from 7,000 hours of diverse audio.

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results in multiple audio-language benchmarks, outperforming traditional training and data construction strategies in auditory perception and instruction-following capabilities.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of meticulous data construction in developing LALMs, providing practical insights for building robust, general-purpose audio-language models.

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

### [296] [Multi-agent Auditory Scene Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02755)
*Caleb Rascon,Luis Gato-Diaz,Eduardo García-Alarcón*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that conducts sound source location, separation, and classification tasks in parallel, with feedback loops to improve accuracy and reduce response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional auditory scene analysis systems execute tasks linearly, which increases response time and makes later tasks sensitive to errors, leading to high computational complexity that limits their viability in certain applications.

Method: The proposed system uses a multi-agent approach to run ASA tasks in parallel, with feedback loops to correct local errors and improve robustness, and it integrates open-source tools (JACK and ROS2) for sound acquisition, reproduction, and agent communication.

Result: The MASA system demonstrates robustness against errors, reduced response time, and low computational complexity, making it suitable for applications like bioacoustics, hearing aids, search and rescue, and human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: The paper provides a complete MASA framework as an open-source solution for efficient auditory scene analysis, enabling users to add custom agents and adapt it for various application scenarios.

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

*Jakob Kienegger,Alina Mannanova,Huajian Fang,Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes a low-complexity tracking algorithm using a particle filter combined with temporal feedback to improve tracking and speech enhancement performance in dynamic speaker scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational overhead from resource-intensive tracking methods hinders the application of deep non-linear spatial filters in real-time speech enhancement for moving speakers.

Method: The study introduces a causal, sequential processing framework that integrates a particle filter with temporal feedback from enhanced signals to improve the model's tracking capabilities.

Result: The proposed pipeline demonstrated marked improvements in tracking accuracy along with superior speech enhancement performance on synthetic datasets. Listening tests also showed user preference for the approach over existing methods.

Conclusion: The self-steering pipeline offers a computationally efficient solution for real-time dynamic speech enhancement, outperforming comparable methods while maintaining high tracking and enhancement performance.

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FinAI-BERT, a transformer-based model for detecting AI-related disclosures in financial texts at the sentence level, achieving near-perfect accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of granularity, interpretability, and robustness in existing methods for detecting AI-related disclosures in financial texts.

Method: The authors developed FinAI-BERT, a domain-specific transformer model fine-tuned on 1,586 sentences from U.S. banks' annual reports (2015-2023). The model was evaluated against traditional machine learning baselines and validated through SHAP-based interpretability and robustness checks.

Result: FinAI-BERT achieved 99.37% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.993, significantly outperforming baseline models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Conclusion: FinAI-BERT offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and robust tool for analyzing AI-related disclosures in financial texts, contributing to both financial NLP research and practical applications for analysts and regulators.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate realistic attack-representing data for in-vehicle network security diagnostics using parameterized models to address the scarcity of such data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to constraints of safety, cost, and ethics, it is challenging to test diverse attack scenarios on connected vehicles, leading to a scarcity of attack-representing data critical for developing adaptive intrusion detection systems.

Method: The paper proposes a context-aware attack data generator using parameterized models with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to emulate real-world scenarios and variability in attacks.

Result: Generated data was utilized to develop and evaluate two deep neural network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS), showcasing high detection, classification, and scalability capabilities.

Conclusion: The generated data proves effective for machine learning-driven IDS development, and offers fidelity and variability, providing valuable insights for cybersecurity in connected vehicles.

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) to use steganography for encoding hidden messages and reasoning tasks, finding limited but emerging capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the potential risks posed by LLMs using steganography to evade monitoring and perform hidden tasks.

Method: Evaluated steganographic capabilities of frontier LLMs by testing encoding schemes, reasoning with encoded data, and observing behaviors under enhanced affordances.

Result: LLMs struggled to encode short messages without detection under standard conditions but showed improved performance with added affordances. Basic encoded reasoning capabilities were observed but rarely subtle enough to avoid monitoring.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show early-stage steganographic abilities that are insufficient to bypass robust monitors today but warrant attention for future developments.

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework, Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), that exploits vulnerabilities in LLM alignment to generate functional malware by decomposing malicious intent into benign-appearing sub-tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight a critical vulnerability in current alignment mechanisms of large language models, showcasing how they can be bypassed to create malicious software despite safeguards.

Method: The researchers propose a method called Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), which uses a Malware Description Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to systematically decompose high-level malware intents into benign-appearing sub-tasks that evade AI alignment safeguards.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing jailbreak methods and underground services in malware generation, achieving +365.79% and +78.07% higher correctness, respectively, across benchmark datasets, and successfully reproducing/enhancing 16 real-world malware samples.

Conclusion: The work exposes significant risks in the alignment mechanisms of AI systems by demonstrating how compositional attacks can bypass safeguards and highlights the need for improved security measures in LLM design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

*Giulio Caldarelli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses using artificial intelligence (AI) to address the blockchain oracle problem but concludes that AI-enhanced techniques can improve but not entirely solve the issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether AI can effectively tackle the blockchain oracle problem, which limits the integration of external data into decentralized systems.

Method: The authors critically assess existing literature and practitioner implementations, exploring AI techniques like anomaly detection, fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance within oracle systems.

Result: AI enhances data quality, source selection, and system resilience, but it cannot fully resolve the reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs in oracles.

Conclusion: AI can complement but not replace trust assumptions in oracle systems, emphasizing its role as an auxiliary inference and filtering layer.

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Motivation: To address the lack of unpredictability in software-based pseudo-random generators and secure the critical weights of DNNs for AI system integrity.

Method: Leverage RowHammer-induced DRAM bit-flips to produce an entropy source for encoding and encrypting DNN weight data, with decryption keys based on probabilistic flip behaviors.

Result: EIM-TRNG demonstrates reliable entropy extraction from DRAM, ensuring confidentiality and authenticity for DNN weights, while being low-cost and offering hardware-level protection.

Conclusion: The proposed method validates DRAM as a robust entropy source for security applications and highlights a novel approach to protecting machine learning models via hardware-based TRNG solutions.

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

*Jorge J. Tejero-Fernández,Alfonso Sánchez-Macián*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores using fine-tuned LLMs for detecting IoT security log anomalies and recommending mitigative actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve threat detection and mitigation in IoT systems using advanced tools like LLMs.

Method: The study compares LLM-based approaches (zero-shot, few-shot prompting, fine-tuning) with traditional machine learning methods while mapping anomalies to MITRE CAPEC and incorporating IoT-specific mitigation actions.

Result: LLMs outperform baseline models in multi-class attack classification and successfully combine anomaly detection with actionable recommendations.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs present a promising solution for improving IoT security log analysis, offering better performance and actionable guidance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

*Francesco Blefari,Cristian Cosentino,Francesco Aurelio Pironti,Angelo Furfaro,Fabrizio Marozzo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CyberRAG, an agent-based framework that improves intrusion detection accuracy and explainability in cybersecurity by utilizing specialized classifiers and iterative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overwhelming alert volume and high false-positive rates in intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS), as well as the limitations of conventional machine-learning detectors and standard RAG pipelines.

Method: The framework consists of a central LLM agent orchestrating fine-tuned classifiers, tool adapters, and a retrieval-reasoning loop to provide evidence-consistent and interpretable threat classifications.

Result: CyberRAG achieves over 94% accuracy per class, with final classification accuracy at 94.92%, and generates justifications with high scores (0.94 BERTScore and 4.9/5 expert evaluation).

Conclusion: Agentic, modular RAG systems like CyberRAG improve detection accuracy while enhancing the interpretability and scalability of cybersecurity workflows, making them practical for semi-autonomous operations.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

Method: The paper utilizes Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoders, and Variational Autoencoders to model latent factors, followed by Monte Carlo simulations for scenario generation. Risk metrics like Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are used.

Result: The proposed framework successfully captures non-linear dependencies and improves robustness, flexibility, and realism in stress testing.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve

*Aishik Ghosh,Maximilian Griese,Ulrich Haisch,Tae Hyoun Park*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid neural simulation-based inference (NSBI) technique to construct a likelihood for probing Higgs production with Standard Model effective field theory modifications and applies it to study the Higgs trilinear self-coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling is a major challenge in particle physics, requiring innovative methods beyond the current on-shell techniques for deeper insights into Higgs interactions.

Method: The authors designed a hybrid NSBI approach leveraging matrix-element-enhanced training for SMEFT modifications and combining it with classification-based methods for effective background estimation, integrating these within a likelihood construction framework.

Result: The NSBI approach reached sensitivity levels close to the theoretical optimum and provided constraints for investigating the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider.

Conclusion: The developed method demonstrates a powerful tool for exploring Higgs interactions, including the trilinear coupling, and offers opportunities for constraints on broader SMEFT operators, emphasizing the value of off-shell Higgs production as a complementary probe.

Abstract: One of the forthcoming major challenges in particle physics is the
experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. While efforts
have largely focused on on-shell double- and single-Higgs production in
proton-proton collisions, off-shell Higgs production has also been proposed as
a valuable complementary probe. In this article, we design a hybrid neural
simulation-based inference (NSBI) approach to construct a likelihood of the
Higgs signal incorporating modifications from the Standard Model effective
field theory (SMEFT), relevant background processes, and quantum interference
effects. It leverages the training efficiency of matrix-element-enhanced
techniques, which are vital for robust SMEFT applications, while also
incorporating the practical advantages of classification-based methods for
effective background estimates. We demonstrate that our NSBI approach achieves
sensitivity close to the theoretical optimum and provide expected constraints
for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. While we
primarily concentrate on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, we also consider
constraints on other SMEFT operators that affect off-shell Higgs production.

*Marc-André Carbonneau,Benjamin van Niekerk,Hugo Seuté,Jean-Philippe Letendre,Herman Kamper,Julian Zaïdi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper examines automatic speaker verification (ASV) embeddings, revealing their bias toward static voice features while neglecting dynamic ones and introduces the U3D metric to better evaluate speaker rhythm patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prominence of generative speech systems necessitates better assessment of voice identity, as current metrics ignore dynamic voice aspects and are influenced by confounding factors.

Method: The authors analyze ASV embeddings for static and dynamic voice properties, identify weaknesses in measuring speaker similarity, and propose the U3D metric to evaluate rhythm patterns better.

Result: ASV embeddings were found to predominantly capture static features like timbre and pitch range while neglecting dynamic aspects like rhythm. Confounding factors in speaker similarity measurements were also identified and addressed.

Conclusion: This study highlights limitations in current voice identity assessments and contributes a novel metric, U3D, to enhance evaluation of dynamic rhythm patterns in generative speech systems. Public code release enables broader access and research.

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

TL;DR: The paper presents the ASDA model, introducing a differential attention mechanism to enhance audio self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results in several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer's attention mechanism can allocate weights to irrelevant information, impacting its performance in audio self-supervised representation tasks.

Method: A differential attention mechanism with dual-softmax operations and tuned differential coefficients is introduced to optimize attention allocations.

Result: The ASDA model achieved SOTA across benchmarks: 49.0% mAP (AS-2M), 41.5% mAP (AS20K), 98.3% accuracy (SPC-2), and 96.1% accuracy (ESC-50), validating its superiority in audio-related tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ASDA model is highly effective in audio tasks, suggesting its potential for broader applications in the domain.

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Using ecoacoustic monitoring with neural approaches, this paper evaluates performance through a signal-to-noise ratio method and models detection distance for call density estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve ecoacoustic monitoring systems for evaluating animal populations, especially Rock Ptarmigan, through better detection methods.

Method: A simple acoustic analysis method that relates signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their detection probability, optimizing training and modeling detection.

Result: The method provides detailed system performance information, detection distance modeling, and sound environment dynamics, aiding spatial density estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances monitoring effectiveness and enables ecological insights into species call patterns and density over time.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and improves protections against unauthorized voice cloning, presenting a novel two-stage purification method that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from heightened privacy and security concerns due to advances in voice cloning and the inadequacies of current adversarial perturbation defenses to fully stop determined attackers.

Method: The research conducts a systematic evaluation of protective perturbations against voice cloning under realistic threat models and introduces a two-stage purification method involving speech purification and phoneme-guided refinement.

Result: The proposed method disrupts voice cloning defenses more effectively than state-of-the-art purification strategies by addressing distortions in the feature space introduced by perturbation neutralization.

Conclusion: Adversarial perturbation-based defenses are insufficient to counter voice cloning risks effectively, emphasizing the need for more robust security solutions; the introduced purification method shows promise as an enhancement.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new methods for unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models and demonstrates better performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for principled and effective approaches for speech enhancement using diffusion models without reliance on hyperparameter tuning or approximate likelihood scores.

Method: Proposes two alternative algorithms: one integrates diffusion priors with observation models in a principled manner, and the other utilizes diffusion processes over noisy speech for exact likelihood scores.

Result: Shows improved enhancement metrics and robustness to domain shifts on datasets WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: These approaches advance unsupervised speech enhancement and outperform existing models, enabling improved capabilities in noisy speech processing.

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This research integrates Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Explainable AI (XAI) to predict fatigue strength of welded steel structures, emphasizing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the prediction and explanation of fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details, combining traditional engineering approaches with advanced AI techniques.

Method: Regression models (gradient boosting, random forests, neural networks) trained with AutoML under three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic-based, and combined feature designs.

Result: Ensemble models like CatBoost and LightGBM demonstrated superior performance, with the domain-informed model achieving the best balance of accuracy ($R^2 ≈ 0.780$ across the full range). XAI methods identified key predictors such as stress ratio and post-weld treatment.

Conclusion: The unified AutoML-XAI framework produces accurate and interpretable models, supporting AI-enhanced design and fatigue assessment for welded structures, with potential future applications in probabilistic modeling and digital twins.

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the ubiquitous 5G PRS signals for efficient multistatic integrated sensing and communications, targeting accurate moving-target detection and tracking.

Method: The study uses a distributed architecture with one gNB transmitter and multiple receivers to process the OFDM-PRS waveform. Algorithms include coherent cross-ambiguity function, trilateration, radial-speed inversion, and Kalman filters for estimation refinement.

Result: Demonstrated high-fidelity detection, positioning, and tracking capabilities using the 5G PRS signals in both 2D and 3D scenarios, even for multiple targets.

Conclusion: The approach successfully harnesses available 5G PRS for effective multistatic ISAC, proving its feasibility and potential in practical applications like tracking moving targets.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference
Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits
a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers
exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and
tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a
range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are
extracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays
are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric
position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed
equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are
obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account
for time synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving
target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to
standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results
show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G
PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.

Main category: q-fin.GN

TL;DR: This paper develops a predictive framework for customer data-sharing behaviors using Open Banking, achieving high accuracy with XGBoost models and identifying key influencing factors through explanatory analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open Banking introduces challenges and opportunities from increased data sharing, influencing customer behavior and requiring financial institutions to innovate while managing competition.

Method: The study used data from 3.2 million customers, applying ADASYN and NEARMISS techniques for data balancing and training XGBoost models, complemented by SHAP and CART for explanatory analysis.

Result: XGBoost models predicted data sharing with an accuracy of 91.39% (inflow) and 91.53% (outflow), and identified key predictors such as mobile transactions and credit activities.

Conclusion: Mobile customer engagement and credit features are critical in influencing data sharing, providing actionable insights for financial institutions in the Open Banking landscape.

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

### [321] [Real-time Image-based Lighting of Glints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02674)
*Tom Kneiphof,Reinhard Klein*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time method for rendering sparkling or glittering materials using image-based lighting. It focuses on fast, per-frame environment map filtering for dynamic material properties and lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in rendering materials with glints under realistic and dynamic lighting conditions, which are demanded in real-time applications.

Method: The method utilizes a fast environment map filtering process, segmenting the map into regions of constant radiance. It calculates probabilities for microfacets to reflect light and employs a novel dual-gated Gaussian approach for sampling a multinomial distribution.

Result: The approach achieves results close to ground-truth renderings for various materials and lighting conditions, showing stable performance with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully renders dynamic glints in real-time with reasonable memory overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications involving complex materials.

Abstract: Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

### [323] [Accelerated Portfolio Optimization and Option Pricing with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01972)
*Hadi Keramati,Samaneh Jazayeri*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to optimize block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers for portfolio optimization and option pricing. This technique addresses slow convergence in ill-conditioned linear systems and reduces computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the computational challenges and slow convergence in solving large ill-conditioned linear systems, commonly encountered in portfolio optimization and option pricing, motivated the research.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework is utilized to dynamically adjust block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers, replacing traditional parameter tuning methods.

Result: The RL framework significantly improved solver convergence rates and decreased computational costs in tests involving real-world portfolio matrices.

Conclusion: The RL-driven optimization enhances iterative solver performance, facilitating faster decision-making in portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing applications.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.

### [324] [Seeing Through Green: Text-Based Classification and the Firm's Returns from Green Patents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02287)
*Lapo Santarlasci,Armando Rungi,Antonio Zinilli*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper uses NLP techniques to filter actual green patents from prior classified datasets, analyzing their economic and technological impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to distinguish genuine environmental patents from previously broad classifications, providing accurate data for policy and economic analysis.

Method: The study utilized a neural network to refine the dictionary of green patents and analyzed their impact on firm-level financial metrics.

Result: Only 20% of previous green patents were deemed "true" green after analysis. These patents positively influenced sales, market share, and productivity, with high-novelty green patents yielding better profits.

Conclusion: Text analysis leads to a precise classification of green patents, enabling better policymaking and highlighting their economic advantages.

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

### [325] [Dissecting the Impact of Mobile DVFS Governors on LLM Inference Performance and Energy Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02135)
*Zongpu Zhang,Pranab Dash,Y. Charlie Hu,Qiang Xu,Jian Li,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper introduces FUSE, an energy-aware governor designed to optimize the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference on resource-limited mobile devices by addressing inefficiencies in independent CPU, GPU, and memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs demand high computation, memory, and energy, creating inefficiencies on mobile devices due to independent CPU, GPU, and memory frequency governors.

Method: The authors measured energy efficiency in existing LLM frameworks, conducted studies on interplay among mobile governors, and developed FUSE to provide a unified energy-aware approach.

Result: FUSE demonstrated improvements in latency metrics: reducing time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and 25.4%-36.8% respectively, with consistent energy consumption.

Conclusion: Unified energy-aware management can make LLMs more efficient and practical for mobile deployment while maintaining energy usage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

TL;DR: MetaFO is a Bayesian transformer-based foundation model for metamaterials, enabling zero-shot predictions and nonlinear inverse designs under diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in AI-driven metamaterial design include the need for task-specific retraining, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and the reliance on separate forward and inverse design models.

Method: The researchers developed MetaFO, a Bayesian transformer model inspired by large language models, to probabilistically map material properties to structural responses and perform both forward and inverse designs.

Result: MetaFO outperformed existing models in nonlinear inverse design even under out-of-distribution scenarios, expanded the metamaterial design space, and provided robust zero-shot predictions.

Conclusion: MetaFO introduces a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-driven metamaterial discovery, offering an advanced framework for exploring intricate structure-property relationships and fostering innovation.

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LiTEN and LiTEN-FF, advanced AI-based force fields achieving efficient and accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations, overcoming limitations of classical and quantum methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical and quantum simulation methods face challenges in accuracy, scale, and efficiency, while existing AI-based force fields lack optimal balance between complexity, accuracy, and speed.

Method: LiTEN uses Tensorized Quadrangle Attention for efficient modeling of many-body interactions and is pre-trained on nablaDFT, followed by fine-tuning on SPICE for robust biomolecular simulations.

Result: LiTEN achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks like rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, and LiTEN-FF demonstrated broad modeling capabilities with faster inference compared to leading frameworks.

Conclusion: LiTEN-FF advances biomolecular modeling, enabling versatile applications in drug discovery and material design, with efficiency and accuracy exceeding those of prior models.

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the disconnection between AI-designed molecules with desirable properties and their synthetic feasibility, which limits progress in computational drug and material discovery.

Method: SynTwins employs a three-step process of retrosynthesis, searching for similar building blocks, and virtual synthesis to create molecular analogs. It integrates domain-inspired approaches to ensure synthetic accessibility.

Result: SynTwins surpasses current machine learning models in generating synthetically accessible molecular analogs while retaining similarity to target structures. Its hybrid approach ensures synthesizable molecules with comparable properties to unconstrained generators.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges computational molecular design and experimental synthesis, enabling faster discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties across various applications.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

*Semih Kacmaz,E. A. Huerta,Roland Haas*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid machine learning framework using Physics-Informed Neural Operators and diffusion models to accurately simulate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence under diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional deterministic models in simulating high Reynolds number MHD turbulence, particularly in capturing fine-scale dynamics.

Method: The proposed framework combines physics-informed neural operators for core dynamics with score-based diffusion models to refine high-frequency errors, trained on high-fidelity simulation data across a wide Reynolds number range.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for modeling incompressible, resistive MHD turbulence, reconstructing fine-scale dynamics, non-Gaussian statistics, and cross-field correlations, even at extreme turbulent conditions ($Re=10000$).

Conclusion: The hybrid framework demonstrates the ability to simulate highly turbulent MHD flows with improved accuracy, addressing limitations of deterministic models and unlocking new areas for surrogate modeling.

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

Result: The proposed design effectively enhances system performance, illustrated through a planar quadrotor example subject to challenging ground effects.

Conclusion: The approach improves predictive robustness and system adaptability, particularly under uncertain conditions, and ensures safety and convergence with high probability.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control
(MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded
disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust

the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a selective feature re-encoding strategy and a parallel-mode QCNN architecture to improve image classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the performance of QCNNs in classifying classical and quantum data, focusing on improving quantum circuit feature processing and leveraging complementary features.

Method: The authors propose a selective feature re-encoding strategy for prioritizing informative features and design a parallel QCNN architecture that integrates PCA and Autoencoder-based features through joint optimization.

Result: The proposed methods were tested on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification, showing improved feature processing and outperforming traditional and independent learning approaches.

Conclusion: The findings validate the efficacy of selective feature re-encoding and parallel QCNN architecture, demonstrating their potential in improving classification accuracy and generalization capabilities in quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.
