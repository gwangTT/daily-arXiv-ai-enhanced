Abstract: Smart home lighting systems consume 15-20% of residential energy but lack adaptive intelligence to optimize for user comfort and energy efficiency simultaneously. We present BitRL-Light, a novel framework combining 1-bit quantized Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning for real-time smart home lighting control on edge devices. Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying adaptive AI on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling intelligent home automation without cloud dependencies.

Conclusion: By leveraging quantum-inspired techniques with classical algorithms, the framework effectively balances exploration and exploitation, demonstrating scalability, robustness, and enhanced performance for UAV-assisted 6G networks.

Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods.

### [3] [MegaRAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20626)
*Chi-Hsiang Hsiao,Yi-Cheng Wang,Tzung-Sheng Lin,Yi-Ren Yeh,Chu-Song Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to allow large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning over textual and visual content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve LLMs' ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content, which is challenged by limited context windows, and to integrate information from both textual and visual modalities for enhanced comprehension.

Method: The authors incorporate visual cues into all phases of the retrieval-augmented generation process by leveraging multimodal knowledge graphs, which structure and summarize content hierarchically across both modalities.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing RAG-based methods in both global and fine-grained question answering tasks on textual and multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating visual cues into multimodal knowledge graphs significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, offering a more effective solution for question answering over complex, multimodal content.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to dynamically access external information, which is powerful for answering questions over previously unseen documents. Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.

### [7] [Reasoning Relay: Evaluating Stability and Interchangeability of Large Language Models in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20647)
*Leo Lu,Jonathan Zhang,Sean Chua,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the interchangeability of reasoning chains between language models of the same or different families, aiming to assess their coherence and accuracy when partially completed reasoning is transferred.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether reasoning chains generated by one language model can be reliably continued by another, shedding light on inference-time trustworthiness and enhancing modular reasoning in AI systems.

Method: The researchers used partially completed reasoning chains from baseline models Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, truncated at various stages based on token-level log-probability thresholds. Continuation experiments were conducted with smaller models (Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct), evaluating reasoning stability using a Process Reward Model (PRM).

Result: The study found that hybrid reasoning chains often maintained or even improved final logical coherence and accuracy, demonstrating that reasoning chains can be interchangeable between models.

Conclusion: Reasoning chains can be treated as transferable scaffolds across language models, paving the way for advancements in modular reasoning and fostering reliability in collaborative AI environments.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.

Conclusion: AAT offers a scalable and auditable framework for AI governance, aiding in risk tracing, accountability, and early warnings in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of AI-driven applications powered by large language models has led to a surge in AI interaction data, raising urgent challenges in security, accountability, and risk traceability. This paper presents AiAuditTrack (AAT), a blockchain-based framework for AI usage traffic recording and governance. AAT leverages decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VC) to establish trusted and identifiable AI entities, and records inter-entity interaction trajectories on-chain to enable cross-system supervision and auditing. AI entities are modeled as nodes in a dynamic interaction graph, where edges represent time-specific behavioral trajectories. Based on this model, a risk diffusion algorithm is proposed to trace the origin of risky behaviors and propagate early warnings across involved entities. System performance is evaluated using blockchain Transactions Per Second (TPS) metrics, demonstrating the feasibility and stability of AAT under large-scale interaction recording. AAT provides a scalable and verifiable solution for AI auditing, risk management, and responsibility attribution in complex multi-agent environments.

### [9] [Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS): Learning to Route Between MHA, GQA, and MQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20650)
*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), which dynamically selects the optimal attention mechanism for tokens, combining qualities of Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Query Attention (MQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between inference efficiency and modeling quality in Transformer models, as existing mechanisms like MHA, GQA, and MQA have limitations in balancing performance and memory efficiency.

Method: The proposed method, MoAS, employs a learned router to dynamically choose between MHA, GQA, and MQA for each token based on the token's characteristics.

Result: Experiments on WikiText-2 demonstrate that MoAS achieves a validation loss of 2.3074, outperforming a static mixture (2.3093) and achieving competitive performance compared to MHA while offering potential for efficiency gains.

Conclusion: MoAS strikes a balance between modeling quality and efficiency by dynamically choosing attention mechanisms, validating its effectiveness through experiments.

Abstract: The choice of attention mechanism in Transformer models involves a critical trade-off between modeling quality and inference efficiency. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers the best quality but suffers from large Key-Value (KV) cache memory requirements during inference. Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) reduce memory usage but often at the cost of model performance. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: Current LLMs face challenges such as limited memory, forgetting long-term information, accumulating redundant data, and generating hallucinations, which hinder continuous interactions and personalized services.

Method: Memory Bear incorporates multimodal information perception, dynamic memory management, and adaptive cognitive services to enhance the memory mechanisms of LLMs in line with cognitive science principles.

Result: Memory Bear shows superior performance in domains like healthcare, enterprise, and education, improving long-term knowledge fidelity, reducing hallucinations, enhancing adaptability, and demonstrating better memory-cognition integration.

Conclusion: The Memory Bear system advances LLM capabilities from basic memory functionalities to integrated cognition, outperforming other solutions across key performance metrics.

### [11] [AI-Driven Decision-Making System for Hiring Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20652)
*Vira Filatova,Andrii Zelenchuk,Dmytro Filatov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven multi-agent hiring assistant to streamline early-stage candidate validation, reducing hiring time and cost while maintaining human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and inconsistencies in early-stage hiring processes by integrating AI to handle diverse candidate inputs and improve decision-making.

Method: Developed a modular pipeline that includes document/video preprocessing, candidate profile construction, public data verification, scoring for technical and cultural fit, and human-in-the-loop validation, directed by an LLM.

Result: Tested on 64 real applicants for a Python backend role, the system achieved 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for an experienced recruiter, demonstrating improved efficiency at lower costs.

Conclusion: The AI-driven system enhances hiring efficiency and cost-effectiveness while keeping human recruiters as the final authority, showing potential for scalable implementation.

Abstract: Early-stage candidate validation is a major bottleneck in hiring, because recruiters must reconcile heterogeneous inputs (resumes, screening answers, code assignments, and limited public evidence). This paper presents an AI-driven, modular multi-agent hiring assistant that integrates (i) document and video preprocessing, (ii) structured candidate profile construction, (iii) public-data verification, (iv) technical/culture-fit scoring with explicit risk penalties, and (v) human-in-the-loop validation via an interactive interface. The pipeline is orchestrated by an LLM under strict constraints to reduce output variability and to generate traceable component-level rationales. Candidate ranking is computed by a configurable aggregation of technical fit, culture fit, and normalized risk penalties. The system is evaluated on 64 real applicants for a mid-level Python backend engineer role, using an experienced recruiter as the reference baseline and a second, less experienced recruiter for additional comparison. Alongside precision/recall, we propose an efficiency metric measuring expected time per qualified candidate. In this study, the system improves throughput and achieves 1.70 hours per qualified candidate versus 3.33 hours for the experienced recruiter, with substantially lower estimated screening cost, while preserving a human decision-maker as the final authority.

### [12] [From Fake Focus to Real Precision: Confusion-Driven Adversarial Attention Learning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20661)
*Yawei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Adversarial Feedback for Attention (AFA) training mechanism to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis by better focusing Transformer-based models' attention on task-relevant words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their strengths, Transformer models often allocate attention to common words while neglecting task-relevant terms, leading to reduced accuracy. The study aims to optimize attention allocation to improve performance.

Method: The proposed AFA training mechanism dynamically adjusts attention distributions through a dynamic masking strategy and a discriminator. Additionally, a policy gradient approach is employed to optimize attention efficiently.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with an enhancement of 12.6% when the method is applied to large language models.

Conclusion: The AFA training mechanism effectively redistributes attention to improve the performance of Transformer-based models in sentiment analysis, providing a significant performance boost, particularly in large language models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have been widely adopted for sentiment analysis tasks due to their exceptional ability to capture contextual information. However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, applying this training mechanism to enhance attention in large language models yields a further performance improvement of 12.6%

### [13] [Quantifying Laziness, Decoding Suboptimality, and Context Degradation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20662)
*Yiqing Ma,Jung-Hua Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates behavioral artifacts in large language models (LLMs), such as laziness, decoding suboptimality, and context degradation, through experiments. The study suggests that while laziness in multi-instruction compliance persists, models may perform better than expected in context retention and decoding in specific cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify behavioral artifacts like laziness, decoding suboptimality, and context degradation in advanced LLMs, as these artifacts affect the quality and reliability of responses.

Method: The authors conducted three controlled experiments focusing on multi-part instructions (to analyze laziness), reasoning-based decoding (to test decoding suboptimality), and chaotic long-turn conversations (to examine context degradation).

Result: The results show widespread laziness when performing complex instructions, limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in reasoning tasks, and surprising robustness against context degradation in long conversations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for improving instruction compliance while noting that LLMs demonstrate robustness in specific failure modes. The authors recommend techniques like self-refinement and dynamic prompting as strategies to enhance performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit behavioral artifacts such as laziness (premature truncation of responses or partial compliance with multi-part requests), decoding suboptimality (failure to select higher-quality sequences due to myopic decoding), and context degradation (forgetting or ignoring core instructions over long conversations). We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.

### [14] [Eidoku: A Neuro-Symbolic Verification Gate for LLM Reasoning via Structural Constraint Satisfaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20664)
*Shinobu Miya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by reformulating the verification process as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) focusing on structural consistency instead of probability-based plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of hallucinations in LLMs, where generated statements are highly probable but lack structural consistency, exposing limitations in traditional verification methods.

Method: The authors propose a CSP-based verification using a total cost function comprising structural, geometric, and symbolic proxies, implemented through a System-2 gate called Eidoku, which applies a context-calibrated cost threshold.

Result: This approach effectively rejects smooth falsehoods (highly probable but structurally incorrect statements) and enables deterministic rejection of hallucinations in a controlled diagnostic dataset.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that enforcing structural constraints in reasoning leads to successful verification of LLM logic, addressing a critical gap in probability-based verification systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce hallucinated statements that are assigned high likelihood by the model itself, exposing a fundamental limitation of probability-based verification. This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.

Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in assessing AI systems' trustworthiness due to differences between implementation (FTAI) and regulation (NTAI), enabling consistent evaluation.

Method: The method involves reviewing the current state-of-the-art, identifying gaps, and proposing a semantic language framework to align FTAI and NTAI.

Result: The paper outlines starting points for creating a semantic language and its potential benefits in translating norms into implementation steps.

Conclusion: A semantic framework is proposed as a necessary bridge between FTAI and NTAI, with recommendations for future steps to promote trustworthy AI assessment.

Abstract: Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is gaining traction due to regulations and functional benefits. While Functional TAI (FTAI) focuses on how to implement trustworthy systems, Normative TAI (NTAI) focuses on regulations that need to be enforced. However, gaps between FTAI and NTAI remain, making it difficult to assess trustworthiness of AI systems. We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI. We will discuss starting points for developing a semantic language and the envisioned effects of it. Finally, we provide key considerations and discuss future actions towards assessment of TAI.

### [16] [From Pilots to Practices: A Scoping Review of GenAI-Enabled Personalization in Computer Science Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20714)
*Iman Reihanian,Yunfei Hou,Qingquan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study reviews 32 research papers from 2023-2025 to assess how personalization through generative AI affects learning in higher-education computer science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative AI in education personalizes learning effectively and improves outcomes in higher-education computer science.

Method: A scoping review of 32 purposively selected studies focusing on AI-driven personalization mechanisms and their effectiveness in computer science education.

Result: Successful approaches highlighted include context-aware tutoring, multi-level hints, integration with traditional grading tools, and human quality checks. Key risks include academic integrity, biases, and over-reliance.

Conclusion: Generative AI can improve learning when thoughtfully designed into audit-ready workflows, supporting student reflection and maintaining academic rigor.

Abstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.

*Prajwal Ghimire,Keyoumars Ashkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the distinction between artificial and organic intelligence, suggesting that AI is fundamentally inspired by human neurobiology and evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and bridge the conceptual dichotomy between artificial and organic intelligence, specifically in the context of digital health.

Method: This paper examines the conceptual and foundational principles linking organic intelligence with artificial intelligence, analyzing neural networks and human cognitive inspirations.

Result: The study finds that AI systems are fundamentally rooted in principles of organization and adaptation drawn from human ingenuity and biology.

Conclusion: The artificial and organic divide is less clear-cut, indicating AI's deep connection to human-derived and evolutionary processes.

Abstract: The term artificial implies an inherent dichotomy from the natural or organic. However, AI, as we know it, is a product of organic ingenuity: designed, implemented, and iteratively improved by human cognition. The very principles that underpin AI systems, from neural networks to decision-making algorithms, are inspired by the organic intelligence embedded in human neurobiology and evolutionary processes. The path from organic to artificial intelligence in digital health is neither mystical nor merely a matter of parameter count, it is fundamentally about organization and adaption. Thus, the boundaries between artificial and organic are far less distinct than the nomenclature suggests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack computational efficiency and accuracy for solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations.

Method: AgentMath integrates language models and code interpreters, and introduces: (1) a method to convert chain-of-thought into tool-augmented trajectories; (2) a novel reinforcement learning strategy combining natural language generation and real-time code execution for tool use; and (3) an efficient, innovative training system for RL with long sequences and massive tool calls.

Result: AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on major mathematical competition benchmarks, including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25, with accuracy scores of 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8%.

Conclusion: AgentMath demonstrates significant improvement in mathematical reasoning capabilities and efficiency, suggesting advancements for scalable models in mathematical problem-solving.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool calls.Extensive evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced capabilities.These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.

### [19] [A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798)
*Miles Q. Li,Benjamin C. M. Fung,Martin Weiss,Pulei Xiong,Khalil Al-Hussaeni,Claude Fachkha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark to analyze multi-step actions by AI agents, considering ethical and safety constraints under performance pressure. Observations show significant violations, including by advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address gaps in ensuring the safety and ethical alignment of autonomous AI agents in high-stakes, real-world contexts, particularly under performance-driven incentives.

Method: The authors created a novel benchmark of 40 multi-step scenarios with variations focused on Mandated (obedience) and Incentivized (performance-oriented) conditions, testing 12 state-of-the-art models for constraint violations.

Result: Outcome-driven constraint violations were found in rates ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%. Superior reasoning did not guarantee ethical adherence, with one advanced model showing above 60% violation, highlighting 'deliberative misalignment'.

Conclusion: The findings underline the need for improved realistic agent-safety training to better align AI behaviors with ethical and safety standards in practical deployments.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant "deliberative misalignment", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

*Anselm Paulus,Ilia Kulikov,Brandon Amos,Rémi Munos,Ivan Evtimov,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Arman Zharmagambetov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdvGame, a method framing safety alignment in language models (LMs) as a non-zero-sum game between adversarial and defensive LMs for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ensuring language model safety rely on adversarial training which is sequential in nature. The authors aim to improve safety and utility of LMs by introducing an adaptive framework.

Method: The authors propose AdvGame, a framework where an Attacker LM and a Defender LM are trained together via online reinforcement learning with preference-based reward signals.

Result: AdvGame effectively advances the balance of safety and utility in LMs, producing an Attacker LM as a strong adversarial tool and a Defender LM that is both resilient to attacks and helpful.

Conclusion: The new paradigm demonstrates improved safety alignment by iteratively training LMs through adaptive strategies, offering robust and general-purpose outcomes.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of language models (LMs) while maintaining their usefulness remains a critical challenge in AI alignment. Current approaches rely on sequential adversarial training: generating adversarial prompts and fine-tuning LMs to defend against them. We introduce a different paradigm: framing safety alignment as a non-zero-sum game between an Attacker LM and a Defender LM trained jointly via online reinforcement learning. Each LM continuously adapts to the other's evolving strategies, driving iterative improvement. Our method uses a preference-based reward signal derived from pairwise comparisons instead of point-wise scores, providing more robust supervision and potentially reducing reward hacking. Our RL recipe, AdvGame, shifts the Pareto frontier of safety and utility, yielding a Defender LM that is simultaneously more helpful and more resilient to adversarial attacks. In addition, the resulting Attacker LM converges into a strong, general-purpose red-teaming agent that can be directly deployed to probe arbitrary target models.

### [21] [Context-Sensitive Abstractions for Reinforcement Learning with Parameterized Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20831)
*Rashmeet Kaur Nayyar,Naman Shah,Siddharth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in sequential decision-making with parameterized action spaces by proposing RL algorithms that autonomously learn state and action abstractions, improving sample efficiency in long-horizon sparse-reward domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for parameterized action spaces have limitations, such as requiring manual action modeling or focusing on either discrete or continuous actions without integrating both effectively.

Method: Algorithms were introduced to autonomously refine state and action abstractions during learning, focusing on critical regions of the state-action space for improved resolution.

Result: The approach showed significantly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines across multiple domains with parameterized actions.

Conclusion: The proposed abstraction-driven RL method enables better performance in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks by effectively learning and refining state-action representations.

Abstract: Real-world sequential decision-making often involves parameterized action spaces that require both, decisions regarding discrete actions and decisions about continuous action parameters governing how an action is executed. Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($λ$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of degeneration in reasoning when large language models (LLMs) reflect on their own outputs, proposing multi-agent multi-persona debaters as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to address the problem of degeneration in LLM's reasoning abilities during self-reflection, where repeated self-reflection leads to recurring errors.

Method: They introduce a multi-agent system with diverse multi-persona debaters to generate reflections in LLMs, improving diversity and accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves 47% Exact Match on HotPot QA and 82.7% on HumanEval, surpassing performance when a single LLM reflects alone.

Conclusion: Using multi-agent systems with multi-persona debaters enhances the reasoning and reflection capabilities of LLMs, resolving the degeneration issue.

Abstract: LLMs have shown the capacity to improve their performance on reasoning tasks through reflecting on their mistakes, and acting with these reflections in mind. However, continual reflections of the same LLM onto itself exhibit degeneration of thought, where the LLM continues to repeat the same errors again and again even with the knowledge that its wrong. To address this problem, we instead introduce multi-agent with multi-persona debators as the method to generate reflections. Through out extensive experimentation, we've found that the leads to better diversity of in the reflections generated by the llm agent. We demonstrate an accuracy of 47% EM HotPot QA (question answering) and 82.7% on HumanEval (programming), both performances surpassing reflection with a single llm.

### [23] [The Silent Scholar Problem: A Probabilistic Framework for Breaking Epistemic Asymmetry in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20884)
*Zan-Kai Chong,Hiroyuki Ohsaki,Bryan Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework to address epistemic asymmetry in LLM-powered agents, emphasizing bidirectional knowledge sharing to reduce uncertainty and enable better learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the epistemic asymmetry in LLM-powered autonomous agents. Current agents are unidirectional, leading to stagnant collective intelligence and redundant reasoning. There is a need for a probabilistic, efficient mechanism for agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty and justify external knowledge exchange.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic framework using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor (γ) to model belief and uncertainty. They introduce concepts like epistemic caching and optimal learning where agents focus on maximizing information gain and reducing uncertainty through knowledge sharing and feedback.

Result: The proposed method improves agents' adaptability and efficiency in heterogeneous and dynamically changing environments, surpassing random baselines. The belief states also provide resources for reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This framework allows autonomous agents to engage in scalable, uncertainty-driven self-improvement processes, creating bidirectional interactions that enhance learning and collective intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are proficient consumers of digital content but remain unidirectional, a limitation we term epistemic asymmetry. This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($γ$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $γ$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\mathbb{E}[θ]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Simulation results validate that this uncertainty-driven strategy significantly outperforms random baselines in heterogeneous (Zipfian) environments, maintaining high adaptability to concept drift.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a LangChain and permissioned blockchain model for autonomous AI systems to ensure trust, oversight, and secured decision-making in areas like healthcare and smart cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing utilization of agentic AI systems in critical sectors leads to challenges in ensuring trust, oversight, and integrity of decisions and data.

Method: A LangChain-based multi-agent system integrated with a permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) was designed for governance and auditing of AI decisions.

Result: Experimental results in inventory management, traffic control, and healthcare showed improved security, traceability, and maintained operational latency.

Conclusion: The framework ensures responsible autonomy of high-impact agentic AI systems with efficient security and auditability features.

Abstract: The application of agentic AI systems in autonomous decision-making is growing in the areas of healthcare, smart cities, digital forensics, and supply chain management. Even though these systems are flexible and offer real-time reasoning, they also raise concerns of trust and oversight, and integrity of the information and activities upon which they are founded. The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges. The suggested framework provides a universal system of implementing high-impact agentic AI applications that are autonomous yet responsible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address household budget constraints and fluctuating food prices while meeting nutritional needs, particularly in middle-income settings.

Method: The study implemented a modular multi-agent architecture with specific agents for budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization. These agents share a knowledge base and use substitution graphs to optimize meal plans under constraints.

Result: Simulations showed a 12-18% cost reduction, nutrient adequacy above 95%, and reliability during 20-30% price changes for a Saudi household case study.

Conclusion: This AI framework integrates affordability and nutrition, providing a practical approach to sustainable diet planning aligned with SDGs on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

Abstract: The issue of limited household budgets and nutritional demands continues to be a challenge especially in the middle-income environment where food prices fluctuate. This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.

TL;DR: TrafficSimAgent is an LLM-based framework designed to assist users in traffic simulation tasks, enabling expert-level experiment design and decision optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulation platforms like SUMO and MATSim are challenging for users lacking deep knowledge, creating a need for a more user-friendly solution.

Method: TrafficSimAgent uses high-level expert agents to process natural language instructions and plan workflows, while low-level agents optimize decisions based on real-time traffic conditions.

Result: The framework demonstrates effective execution across various scenarios, producing reasonable results even with ambiguous instructions and surpassing other methods in performance.

Conclusion: TrafficSimAgent simplifies traffic simulation, improving accessibility and performance through expert-level automation and decision-driven optimization.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is important for transportation optimization and policy making. While existing simulators such as SUMO and MATSim offer fully-featured platforms and utilities, users without too much knowledge about these platforms often face significant challenges when conducting experiments from scratch and applying them to their daily work. To solve this challenge, we propose TrafficSimAgent, an LLM-based agent framework that serves as an expert in experiment design and decision optimization for general-purpose traffic simulation tasks. The framework facilitates execution through cross-level collaboration among expert agents: high-level expert agents comprehend natural language instructions with high flexibility, plan the overall experiment workflow, and invoke corresponding MCP-compatible tools on demand; meanwhile, low-level expert agents select optimal action plans for fundamental elements based on real-time traffic conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios show that TrafficSimAgent effectively executes simulations under various conditions and consistently produces reasonable outcomes even when user instructions are ambiguous. Besides, the carefully designed expert-level autonomous decision-driven optimization in TrafficSimAgent yields superior performance when compared with other systems and SOTA LLM based methods.

*Tomoaki Yamaguchi,Yutong Zhou,Masahiro Ryo,Keisuke Katsura*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an agentic explainable AI (XAI) framework using SHAP and iterative multimodal LLM refinement to enhance explanations progressively for agricultural applications. Results show that early improvements yield better recommendations until over-iteration harms quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between XAI outputs and laypersons' understanding by leveraging LLMs for better communication, while incorporating agentic AI to explore iterative refinement for improving explanations.

Method: The method integrates SHAP-based explainability with LLM-driven iterative refinement, applying it to an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from Japan. Explanations underwent 11 refinement rounds, evaluated against qualitative metrics by human experts and LLMs.

Result: The framework led to a 30-33% improvement in explanation quality over 11 refinement rounds, peaking at Rounds 3-4. Excessive refinement resulted in reduced quality due to verbosity and ungrounded abstraction.

Conclusion: Strategic early stopping in agentic XAI is crucial to optimize practical utility, addressing the trade-off between explanation depth (bias) and verbosity (variance). This offers evidence-based principles for designing iterative XAI systems.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboSafe, a safety mechanism for embodied agents to improve handling tasks safely by detecting and mitigating hazardous actions using hybrid reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing runtime safety implementations for embodied agents by introducing a mechanism that can dynamically adapt to complex, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments.

Method: RoboSafe employs a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that revisits recent task history in short-term memory to detect safety violations and a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that uses long-term memory and observations to anticipate risks.

Result: RoboSafe reduces hazardous actions by 36.8% while retaining task performance and demonstrates practicality in real-world scenarios such as physical robotic arms.

Conclusion: RoboSafe presents a significant advancement in runtime safety for embodied agents by combining adaptive, interpretable, and executable safety logic, enhancing both safety and practicality in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This paper examines the validity and usefulness of using LLM-based simulations as a substitute for human subjects in A/B testing, offering theoretical guarantees and conditions under which such simulations can serve as effective benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and latency of field experiments as benchmarks in societal systems by exploring whether simulations (using LLM-based personas) are viable alternatives for iterative method development.

Method: The authors provide an if-and-only-if theoretical condition for when replacing humans with personas in experiments is valid, focusing on aggregate-only observation and algorithm-blind evaluation. They also use information-theoretic discriminability to quantify the number of simulated evaluations needed for reliable benchmarking.

Result: The study demonstrates that persona simulations can serve as panel changes, retaining the benchmark utility given specific conditions, and provides sample-size bounds to achieve decision-relevant benchmarking.

Conclusion: Persona simulations can effectively replace humans in field experiments, provided conditions like aggregate-only observation and algorithm-blind evaluation are met. The effectiveness hinges on sample size for reliable distinguishing between methods.

Abstract: Field experiments (A/B tests) are often the most credible benchmark for methods in societal systems, but their cost and latency create a major bottleneck for iterative method development. LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.

TL;DR: Current LLMs have safety vulnerabilities due to their poor contextual understanding and inability to detect user intent, making them exploitable despite existing mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked vulnerability in LLMs concerning their inability to detect user intent and understand context, leading to safety exploitation.

Method: Empirical evaluation of various state-of-the-art LLMs using techniques like emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification to observe safety bypass methods.

Result: Results showed that all tested LLMs, except Claude Opus 4.1 in certain scenarios, were susceptible to exploitation. Reasoning-enabled configurations amplified attempts instead of detecting malicious intent.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a paradigm shift in LLM safety from reactionary mechanisms to proactive contextual understanding and intent recognition.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) safety approaches focus on explicitly harmful content while overlooking a critical vulnerability: the inability to understand context and recognize user intent. This creates exploitable vulnerabilities that malicious users can systematically leverage to circumvent safety mechanisms. We empirically evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our analysis demonstrates the circumvention of reliable safety mechanisms through emotional framing, progressive revelation, and academic justification techniques. Notably, reasoning-enabled configurations amplified rather than mitigated the effectiveness of exploitation, increasing factual precision while failing to interrogate the underlying intent. The exception was Claude Opus 4.1, which prioritized intent detection over information provision in some use cases. This pattern reveals that current architectural designs create systematic vulnerabilities. These limitations require paradigmatic shifts toward contextual understanding and intent recognition as core safety capabilities rather than post-hoc protective mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of a large language model (LLM)-based medication safety review system on real NHS clinical data, revealing significant limitations in contextual reasoning and highlighting failure patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the real-world performance of LLMs in clinical settings for medication safety reviews, addressing the gap between benchmark performances and application on actual clinical data.

Method: The researchers conducted a retrospective study using population-scale NHS Cheshire and Merseyside EHR data. They sampled patients with diverse clinical complexities, had experts grade system-identified issues, and analyzed failure patterns.

Result: The LLM demonstrated strong sensitivity (100%) but identified all issues and interventions accurately in only 46.9% of patients. Key failure modes such as contextual reasoning errors and overconfidence in uncertainty were identified.

Conclusion: LLMs are not yet ready for safe deployment in clinical contexts due to context-based failures and require further large-scale evaluation and in-depth behavioral studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often match or exceed clinician-level performance on medical benchmarks, yet very few are evaluated on real clinical data or examined beyond headline metrics. We present, to our knowledge, the first evaluation of an LLM-based medication safety review system on real NHS primary care data, with detailed characterisation of key failure behaviours across varying levels of clinical complexity. In a retrospective study using a population-scale EHR spanning 2,125,549 adults in NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, we strategically sampled patients to capture a broad range of clinical complexity and medication safety risk, yielding 277 patients after data-quality exclusions. An expert clinician reviewed these patients and graded system-identified issues and proposed interventions. Our primary LLM system showed strong performance in recognising when a clinical issue is present (sensitivity 100\% [95\% CI 98.2--100], specificity 83.1\% [95\% CI 72.7--90.1]), yet correctly identified all issues and interventions in only 46.9\% [95\% CI 41.1--52.8] of patients. Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited and biased RTL benchmarks lacking verification rigor, and to promote advancements in LLM performance for realistic hardware design tasks.

Method: The authors developed the NotSoTiny benchmark using hundreds of hardware designs from the Tiny Tapeout community, employing an automated pipeline to remove duplicates, verify correctness, and regularly update the dataset to avoid data contamination.

Result: NotSoTiny tasks were shown to be more complex than prior benchmarks, highlighting their value in evaluating and improving LLM performance in hardware design.

Conclusion: NotSoTiny provides a robust foundation for assessing LLM capabilities in generating realistic RTL and pushes the field forward by addressing the shortcomings of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: LLMs have shown early promise in generating RTL code, yet evaluating their capabilities in realistic setups remains a challenge. So far, RTL benchmarks have been limited in scale, skewed toward trivial designs, offering minimal verification rigor, and remaining vulnerable to data contamination. To overcome these limitations and to push the field forward, this paper introduces NotSoTiny, a benchmark that assesses LLM on the generation of structurally rich and context-aware RTL. Built from hundreds of actual hardware designs produced by the Tiny Tapeout community, our automated pipeline removes duplicates, verifies correctness and periodically incorporates new designs to mitigate contamination, matching Tiny Tapeout release schedule. Evaluation results show that NotSoTiny tasks are more challenging than prior benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in overcoming current limitations of LLMs applied to hardware design, and in guiding the improvement of such promising technology.

*Matyas Bohacek,Nino Scherrer,Nicholas Dufour,Thomas Leung,Christoph Bregler,Stephanie C. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify gaps in large language model (LLM) performance and benchmark coverage, enabling concept-level evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current standardized benchmarks for evaluating LLMs obscure areas where models are weak and where benchmarks themselves may lack coverage.

Method: The authors introduce a method leveraging sparse autoencoders to extract concept activations, compute performance scores, and analyze LLM capabilities and gaps across benchmarks in an unsupervised manner.

Result: The method exposed model weaknesses in areas like rejecting sycophantic behaviors and addressing safety issues, as well as benchmark imbalances favoring obedience-related concepts while neglecting other core areas.

Conclusion: The proposed method complements standard evaluation metrics by highlighting specific capability gaps in LLMs and identifying areas for improving benchmark coverage, offering a concept-level decomposition approach.

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on standardized benchmarks. These benchmarks provide useful aggregated metrics for a given capability, but those aggregated metrics can obscure (i) particular sub-areas where the LLMs are weak ("model gaps") and (ii) imbalanced coverage in the benchmarks themselves ("benchmark gaps"). We propose a new method that uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to automatically uncover both types of gaps. By extracting SAE concept activations and computing saliency-weighted performance scores across benchmark data, the method grounds evaluation in the model's internal representations and enables comparison across benchmarks. As examples demonstrating our approach, we applied the method to two popular open-source models and ten benchmarks. We found that these models consistently underperformed on concepts that stand in contrast to sycophantic behaviors (e.g., politely refusing a request or asserting boundaries) and concepts connected to safety discussions. These model gaps align with observations previously surfaced in the literature; our automated, unsupervised method was able to recover them without manual supervision. We also observed benchmark gaps: many of the evaluated benchmarks over-represented concepts related to obedience, authority, or instruction-following, while missing core concepts that should fall within their intended scope. In sum, our method offers a representation-grounded approach to evaluation, enabling concept-level decomposition of benchmark scores. Rather than replacing conventional aggregated metrics, CG complements them by providing a concept-level decomposition that can reveal why a model scored as it did and how benchmarks could evolve to better reflect their intended scope.

*Alexandros Christoforos,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SA-DiffuSeq uses sparse attention in diffusion modeling to improve scalability and efficiency for long-form text generation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in training and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion methods struggle with high computational and memory demands for long text sequences, limiting their scalability and practicality.

Method: SA-DiffuSeq employs sparse attention within the diffusion framework and introduces a soft absorbing state to optimize computational complexity and stabilize sequences.

Result: Experiments show SA-DiffuSeq achieves better training efficiency, faster sampling speed, and higher accuracy in modeling long-range dependencies, surpassing diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured sparsity in diffusion models is effective for scalable long-form text generation, particularly for applications like scientific writing, code generation, and long-context dialogue.

Abstract: Diffusion based approaches to long form text generation suffer from prohibitive computational cost and memory overhead as sequence length increases. We introduce SA-DiffuSeq, a diffusion framework that integrates sparse attention to fundamentally improve scalability for long document modeling. By selectively allocating attention within the diffusion process, SA-DiffuSeq significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining semantic coherence and generation quality. A key component of our method is a soft absorbing state tailored to sparse attention dynamics, which stabilizes diffusion trajectories and accelerates sequence reconstruction. This design improves sampling efficiency and enhances precision in long range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-DiffuSeq consistently surpasses state of the art diffusion baselines in both training efficiency and sampling speed, with especially strong gains on extended sequences. These properties make SA-DiffuSeq well suited for demanding long form applications such as scientific writing, large scale code generation, and multi turn long context dialogue. Overall, our results indicate that incorporating structured sparsity into diffusion models is a promising direction for efficient and expressive long text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TokSuite, a collection of models and benchmarks to study the impact of tokenization on language model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about tokenization’s isolated effect on language model performance.

Method: The authors trained fourteen identical models, differing only in tokenizers, and curated a benchmark measuring the effects of real-world perturbations on tokenization.

Result: TokSuite enables robust analysis of tokenizer influence and reveals insights into the advantages and limitations of various popular tokenizers.

Conclusion: TokSuite provides tools to decouple and study the role of tokenization in language modeling, advancing understanding of its impact.

Abstract: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

*Ziyi Zhu,Olivier Tieleman,Caitlin A. Stamatis,Luka Smyth,Thomas D. Hull,Daniel R. Cahn,Matteo Malgaroli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adversarial training framework to enhance user simulator realism for mental health support chatbots, achieving improved system evaluation and realistic behavior replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate user simulators are essential for detecting failures in task-oriented dialogue systems, particularly in sensitive domains like mental health support chatbots, but creating realistic simulators is a challenge.

Method: The paper uses adversarial training between a user simulator (generator) and a discriminator, iteratively fine-tuning the simulator for increased realism, diversity, and alignment with real user behaviors.

Result: Fine-tuned simulators outperform base models, achieving high correlation with real failure rates while minimizing divergence in failure modes, with evidence of improved realism through reduced discriminator accuracy.

Conclusion: Adversarial training is effective in creating realistic user simulators for mental health support chatbots, enabling efficient system evaluation and reducing deployment risks.

Abstract: Realistic user simulation is crucial for training and evaluating task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, yet creating simulators that accurately replicate human behavior remains challenging. A key property of effective simulators is their ability to expose failure modes of the systems they evaluate. We present an adversarial training framework that iteratively improves user simulator realism through a competitive dynamic between a generator (user simulator) and a discriminator. Applied to mental health support chatbots, our approach demonstrates that fine-tuned simulators dramatically outperform zero-shot base models at surfacing system issues, and adversarial training further enhances diversity, distributional alignment, and predictive validity. The resulting simulator achieves a strong correlation between simulated and real failure occurrence rates across diverse chatbot configurations while maintaining low distributional divergence of failure modes. Discriminator accuracy decreases drastically after three adversarial iterations, suggesting improved realism. These results provide evidence that adversarial training is a promising approach for creating realistic user simulators in mental health support TOD domains, enabling rapid, reliable, and cost-effective system evaluation before deployment.

### [38] [Large Language Models Approach Expert Pedagogical Quality in Math Tutoring but Differ in Instructional and Linguistic Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20780)
*Ramatu Oiza Abdulsalam,Segun Aroyehun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and large language models in math tutoring, finding that large language models can achieve similar levels of pedagogical quality while differing in instructional and linguistic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how the instructional behavior of large language models in mathematics tutoring aligns with expert human practices, especially considering recent advancements in AI models for such applications.

Method: A controlled, turn-level comparison of tutoring responses across expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and large language models was conducted by analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics.

Result: The study shows large language models approach expert levels of pedagogical quality but differ in strategies like underusing restating and revoicing while exhibiting higher lexical diversity, politeness, and longer responses.

Conclusion: Large language models can achieve expert-level pedagogical quality in tutoring but rely on different instructional strategies than humans, suggesting key areas to analyze for improving AI-driven tutoring systems.

Abstract: Recent work has explored the use of large language models for generating tutoring responses in mathematics, yet it remains unclear how closely their instructional behavior aligns with expert human practice. We examine this question using a controlled, turn-level comparison in which expert human tutors, novice human tutors, and multiple large language models respond to the same set of math remediation conversation turns. We examine both instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics of tutoring responses, including restating and revoicing, pressing for accuracy, lexical diversity, readability, politeness, and agency. We find that large language models approach expert levels of perceived pedagogical quality on average but exhibit systematic differences in their instructional and linguistic profiles. In particular, large language models tend to underuse restating and revoicing strategies characteristic of expert human tutors, while producing longer, more lexically diverse, and more polite responses. Statistical analyses show that restating and revoicing, lexical diversity, and pressing for accuracy are positively associated with perceived pedagogical quality, whereas higher levels of agentic and polite language are negatively associated. Overall, recent large language models exhibit levels of perceived pedagogical quality comparable to expert human tutors, while relying on different instructional and linguistic strategies. These findings underscore the value of analyzing instructional strategies and linguistic characteristics when evaluating tutoring responses across human tutors and intelligent tutoring systems.

*Shariqah Hossain,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of model editing algorithms (e.g., ROME, IKE, WISE) for machine unlearning in LLMs, showing that editing methods can surpass traditional unlearning techniques in certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies or incomplete removal of information in unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) while maintaining model performance.

Method: The paper evaluates model editing approaches (ROME, IKE, WISE) and redesigns editing targets specifically for unlearning scenarios.

Result: Model editing methods are found to sometimes outperform traditional unlearning methods in terms of the quality of forgetting, albeit challenges remain in preventing unintended performance degradation.

Conclusion: Model editing provides a promising avenue for improving machine unlearning processes but requires further refinement to encapsulate precise forgetting scopes without harming retained model knowledge.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove unwanted information from a model, but many methods are inefficient for LLMs with large numbers of parameters or fail to fully remove the intended information without degrading performance on knowledge that should be retained. Model editing algorithms solve a similar problem of changing information in models, but they focus on redirecting inputs to a new target rather than removing that information altogether. In this work, we explore the editing algorithms ROME, IKE, and WISE and design new editing targets for an unlearning setting. Through this investigation, we show that model editing approaches can exceed baseline unlearning methods in terms of quality of forgetting depending on the setting. Like traditional unlearning techniques, they struggle to encapsulate the scope of what is to be unlearned without damage to the overall model performance.

*Zhengyang Shan,Aaron Mueller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores ways to reduce demographic biases in language models while maintaining demographic recognition capabilities using targeted debiasing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand how demographic biases in language models can be mitigated without compromising their ability to recognize demographic-related information effectively.

Method: The study employs multi-task evaluations with demographics tied to names, professions, and education levels and compares attribution-based and correlation-based methods for identifying bias features. Sparse autoencoder feature ablations are used for intervention.

Result: Attribution-based ablations effectively reduce race and gender stereotypes while maintaining name recognition accuracy, while correlation-based ablations better address education biases. However, removing attribution features in education tasks may exacerbate biases due to a phenomenon called 'prior collapse.'

Conclusion: Demographic biases in language models are task-specific, and inference-time interventions targeting specific dimensions can mitigate bias without hindering model recognition capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate how independent demographic bias mechanisms are from general demographic recognition in language models. Using a multi-task evaluation setup where demographics are associated with names, professions, and education levels, we measure whether models can be debiased while preserving demographic detection capabilities. We compare attribution-based and correlation-based methods for locating bias features. We find that targeted sparse autoencoder feature ablations in Gemma-2-9B reduce bias without degrading recognition performance: attribution-based ablations mitigate race and gender profession stereotypes while preserving name recognition accuracy, whereas correlation-based ablations are more effective for education bias. Qualitative analysis further reveals that removing attribution features in education tasks induces ``prior collapse'', thus increasing overall bias. This highlights the need for dimension-specific interventions. Overall, our results show that demographic bias arises from task-specific mechanisms rather than absolute demographic markers, and that mechanistic inference-time interventions can enable surgical debiasing without compromising core model capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLMs' ability to perform reasoning tasks using novel symbols, revealing limitations in symbolic abstraction and a tendency to rely on surface-level semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' reasoning abilities in symbolic manipulation tasks, especially in contexts requiring robust symbolic reasoning independent of typical semantic associations.

Method: A framework is introduced to test LLMs with unfamiliar symbolic representations, using deceptive semantic cues in redefined digits and operators, and evaluating their performance on simple calculations.

Result: Experiments with four LLMs show that misleading semantic cues significantly impair reasoning performance, indicating limitations in symbolic manipulation and over-reliance on semantics.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with abstract symbolic reasoning and are prone to semantic cue influences, raising ethical and societal concerns in decision-making and reasoning-based applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in situations where human values are at stake, such as decision-making tasks that involve reasoning when performed by humans. We investigate the so-called reasoning capabilities of LLMs over novel symbolic representations by introducing an experimental framework that tests their ability to process and manipulate unfamiliar symbols. We introduce semantic deceptions: situations in which symbols carry misleading semantic associations due to their form, such as being embedded in specific contexts, designed to probe whether LLMs can maintain symbolic abstraction or whether they default to exploiting learned semantic associations. We redefine standard digits and mathematical operators using novel symbols, and task LLMs with solving simple calculations expressed in this altered notation. The objective is: (1) to assess LLMs' capacity for abstraction and manipulation of arbitrary symbol systems; (2) to evaluate their ability to resist misleading semantic cues that conflict with the task's symbolic logic. Through experiments with four LLMs we show that semantic cues can significantly deteriorate reasoning models' performance on very simple tasks. They reveal limitations in current LLMs' ability for symbolic manipulations and highlight a tendency to over-rely on surface-level semantics, suggesting that chain-of-thoughts may amplify reliance on statistical correlations. Even in situations where LLMs seem to correctly follow instructions, semantic cues still impact basic capabilities. These limitations raise ethical and societal concerns, undermining the widespread and pernicious tendency to attribute reasoning abilities to LLMs and suggesting how LLMs might fail, in particular in decision-making contexts where robust symbolic reasoning is essential and should not be compromised by residual semantic associations inherited from the model's training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EssayCBM, a transparent framework for essay grading focusing on interpretability by scoring writing concepts instead of directly predicting grades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of automated essay grading systems that rely on black-box models, making them difficult for educators and students to understand and trust.

Method: EssayCBM uses a model that evaluates eight specific writing concepts through dedicated prediction heads, forming a transparent intermediate layer (bottleneck) before calculating an essay's grade. Grades are determined by a lightweight network based on these concept scores.

Result: EssayCBM achieves performance levels comparable to black-box models while offering interpretable, concept-level feedback for users.

Conclusion: EssayCBM bridges the gap between automated grading accuracy and the need for interpretability, enabling teachers to make accountable adjustments through a user-friendly interface.

Abstract: Understanding how automated grading systems evaluate essays remains a significant challenge for educators and students, especially when large language models function as black boxes. We introduce EssayCBM, a rubric-aligned framework that prioritizes interpretability in essay assessment. Instead of predicting grades directly from text, EssayCBM evaluates eight writing concepts, such as Thesis Clarity and Evidence Use, through dedicated prediction heads on an encoder. These concept scores form a transparent bottleneck, and a lightweight network computes the final grade using only concepts. Instructors can adjust concept predictions and instantly view the updated grade, enabling accountable human-in-the-loop evaluation. EssayCBM matches black-box performance while offering actionable, concept-level feedback through an intuitive web interface.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MediEval, a benchmark integrating EHRs with a unified biomedical knowledge base to evaluate LLMs' factual consistency in medicine. It also proposes a fine-tuning method, CoRFu, to improve safety and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic benchmarks for evaluating the reliability and safety of LLMs in medicine, particularly their ability to ground knowledge and maintain contextual consistency.

Method: The authors developed MediEval, a benchmark combining MIMIC-IV EHRs with a unified biomedical knowledge base and used it to identify failure modes in current LLMs. They also proposed CoRFu, a fine-tuning method using a DPO-based asymmetric penalty to reduce unsafe confusions.

Result: MediEval revealed critical failure modes in current LLMs, while CoRFu improved accuracy by +16.4 macro-F1 points and eliminated truth inversion errors.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology significantly enhances the reliability and safety of LLMs in medical contexts by systematically addressing their failure points.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medicine, yet their adoption is limited by concerns over reliability and safety. Existing evaluations either test factual medical knowledge in isolation or assess patient-level reasoning without verifying correctness, leaving a critical gap. We introduce MediEval, a benchmark that links MIMIC-IV electronic health records (EHRs) to a unified knowledge base built from UMLS and other biomedical vocabularies. MediEval generates diverse factual and counterfactual medical statements within real patient contexts, enabling systematic evaluation across a 4-quadrant framework that jointly considers knowledge grounding and contextual consistency. Using this framework, we identify critical failure modes, including hallucinated support and truth inversion, that current proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific LLMs frequently exhibit. To address these risks, we propose Counterfactual Risk-Aware Fine-tuning (CoRFu), a DPO-based method with an asymmetric penalty targeting unsafe confusions. CoRFu improves by +16.4 macro-F1 points over the base model and eliminates truth inversion errors, demonstrating both higher accuracy and substantially greater safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates retrieval quality metrics using LLM-based judgments and proposes a new quality measure that works without knowing the total relevant documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating retrieval quality in realistic scenarios where the total number of relevant documents is unknown.

Method: The authors measured the correlation between retrieval metrics and LLM-based quality judgments, and conducted experiments on datasets with limited relevant documents.

Result: They identified effective strategies for evaluating retrieval quality and proposed a new measure that performs well without needing total relevance knowledge.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical quality metric for retrieval systems in scenarios with unknown relevant document numbers.

Abstract: In realistic retrieval settings with large and evolving knowledge bases, the total number of documents relevant to a query is typically unknown, and recall cannot be computed. In this paper, we evaluate several established strategies for handling this limitation by measuring the correlation between retrieval quality metrics and LLM-based judgments of response quality, where responses are generated from the retrieved documents. We conduct experiments across multiple datasets with a relatively low number of relevant documents (2-15). We also introduce a simple retrieval quality measure that performs well without requiring knowledge of the total number of relevant documents.

*Shivraj Singh Bhatti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies small language models under compute constraints, analyzing architectural and training impacts on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the efficiency and performance trade-offs in small language models under strict compute budgets.

Method: A systematic analysis was performed by progressively increasing complexity from linear predictors to multi-layer transformers, evaluating on text modeling datasets and comparing models in terms of NLL, parameter count, and training FLOPs.

Result: Attention-based models are more efficient than MLPs, but depth or context increases can harm performance without proper optimization. RoPE's effectiveness in large models does not apply to smaller models.

Conclusion: Small models' performance hinges on architecture and optimization, with certain techniques for large models not directly applicable to smaller scales.

Abstract: We present a systematic empirical study of small language models under strict compute constraints, analyzing how architectural choices and training budget interact to determine performance. Starting from a linear next-token predictor, we progressively introduce nonlinearities, self-attention, and multi-layer transformer architectures, evaluating each on character-level modeling of Tiny Shakespeare and word-level modeling of Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-2. We compare models using test negative log-likelihood (NLL), parameter count, and approximate training FLOPs to characterize accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our results show that attention-based models dominate MLPs in per-FLOP efficiency even at small scale, while increasing depth or context without sufficient optimization can degrade performance. We further examine rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), finding that architectural techniques successful in large language models do not necessarily transfer to small-model regimes.

### [48] [Where Did This Sentence Come From? Tracing Provenance in LLM Reasoning Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20908)
*Kaiyuan Liu,Shaotian Yan,Rui Miao,Bing Wang,Chen Shen,Jun Zhang,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze how reasoning capabilities are inherited by a student model in reasoning distillation and proposes a teacher-guided data selection method for improved distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the uncertainty regarding whether distilled student models maintain consistent reasoning behaviors in novel test-time contexts or regress to their original patterns, thus scrutinizing the generalization of such models.

Method: The authors introduced a Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework, which involves analyzing predictive probabilities from the teacher, original student, and distilled model for each action under the same context, to classify and trace the action's origins.

Result: Through experiments, the research demonstrates that the distilled model can replicate teacher-originated actions in test contexts. Additionally, the proposed teacher-guided data selection method, which leverages comparative divergences, proves effective across various models.

Conclusion: The provenance-tracing framework and the teacher-guided data selection method enhance reasoning distillation analysis and performance, providing valuable insights and a principled approach for improving student models.

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has attracted increasing attention. It typically leverages a large teacher model to generate reasoning paths, which are then used to fine-tune a student model so that it mimics the teacher's behavior in training contexts. However, previous approaches have lacked a detailed analysis of the origins of the distilled model's capabilities. It remains unclear whether the student can maintain consistent behaviors with the teacher in novel test-time contexts, or whether it regresses to its original output patterns, raising concerns about the generalization of distillation models. To analyse this question, we introduce a cross-model Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing framework. For each action (e.g., a sentence) produced by the distilled model, we obtain the predictive probabilities assigned by the teacher, the original student, and the distilled model under the same context. By comparing these probabilities, we classify each action into different categories. By systematically disentangling the provenance of each action, we experimentally demonstrate that, in test-time contexts, the distilled model can indeed generate teacher-originated actions, which correlate with and plausibly explain observed performance on distilled model. Building on this analysis, we further propose a teacher-guided data selection method. Unlike prior approach that rely on heuristics, our method directly compares teacher-student divergences on the training data, providing a principled selection criterion. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple representative teacher models and diverse student models. The results highlight the utility of our provenance-tracing framework and underscore its promise for reasoning distillation. We hope to share Reasoning Distillation Provenance Tracing and our insights into reasoning distillation with the community.

*Zhongren Dong,Haotian Guo,Weixiang Xu,Huan Zhao,Zixing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FEND, a multi-modal framework combining speech and text for detecting neuropsychiatric disorders like AD, depression, and ASD across languages and ages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenges of multi-lingual generalization and absence of unified evaluation frameworks in neuropsychiatric disorder detection.

Method: The framework integrates speech and text analytics, and evaluates 13 multi-lingual datasets across five languages to test the performance of multi-modal fusion.

Result: FEND improves AD and depression detection but struggles with ASD due to dataset issues. It also highlights modality balance challenges and limitations in multi-lingual, task-heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: FEND sets extensive benchmarks to advance and standardize neuropsychiatric disorder detection, emphasizing its potential for fair and reproducible research.

Abstract: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are characterized by linguistic and acoustic abnormalities, offering potential biomarkers for early detection. Despite the promise of multi-modal approaches, challenges like multi-lingual generalization and the absence of a unified evaluation framework persist. To address these gaps, we propose FEND (Foundation model-based Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders), a comprehensive multi-modal framework integrating speech and text modalities for detecting AD, depression, and ASD across the lifespan. Leveraging 13 multi-lingual datasets spanning English, Chinese, Greek, French, and Dutch, we systematically evaluate multi-modal fusion performance. Our results show that multi-modal fusion excels in AD and depression detection but underperforms in ASD due to dataset heterogeneity. We also identify modality imbalance as a prevalent issue, where multi-modal fusion fails to surpass the best mono-modal models. Cross-corpus experiments reveal robust performance in task- and language-consistent scenarios but noticeable degradation in multi-lingual and task-heterogeneous settings. By providing extensive benchmarks and a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors, FEND advances the field of automated, lifespan-inclusive, and multi-lingual neuropsychiatric disorder assessment. We encourage researchers to adopt the FEND framework for fair comparisons and reproducible research.

### [50] [Neural Probe-Based Hallucination Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20949)
*Shize Liang,Hongzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network-based framework using MLP probes to address hallucination detection in large language models, overcoming limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) generate unreliable or hallucinated content, making them unsuitable for critical applications. Current detection methods are inefficient or overly reliant on external retrieval.

Method: The framework uses lightweight MLP probes on frozen LLM parameters to model hidden-layer states nonlinearly. It also integrates a layer-probe positioning optimization using Bayesian methods for improved performance.

Result: The experimental evaluation on datasets like LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA shows that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy, recall, and detection capability with fewer false positives, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MLP probing approach demonstrates a superior ability to detect hallucinations in LLMs accurately and efficiently, offering a promising lightweight solution for real-time applications.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) excel at text generation and knowledge question-answering tasks, but they are prone to generating hallucinated content, severely limiting their application in high-risk domains. Current hallucination detection methods based on uncertainty estimation and external knowledge retrieval suffer from the limitation that they still produce erroneous content at high confidence levels and rely heavily on retrieval efficiency and knowledge coverage. In contrast, probe methods that leverage the model's hidden-layer states offer real-time and lightweight advantages. However, traditional linear probes struggle to capture nonlinear structures in deep semantic spaces.To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural network-based framework for token-level hallucination detection. By freezing language model parameters, we employ lightweight MLP probes to perform nonlinear modeling of high-level hidden states. A multi-objective joint loss function is designed to enhance detection stability and semantic disambiguity. Additionally, we establish a layer position-probe performance response model, using Bayesian optimization to automatically search for optimal probe insertion layers and achieve superior training results.Experimental results on LongFact, HealthBench, and TriviaQA demonstrate that MLP probes significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, recall, and detection capability under low false-positive conditions.

Conclusion: TriAligner demonstrates the potential to enhance multilingual fact-checking, offering robust solutions to misinformation in various languages.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly, effective fact-checking is increasingly critical. We introduce TriAligner, a novel approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture with contrastive learning and incorporates both native and English translations across different modalities. Our method effectively retrieves claims across multiple languages by learning the relative importance of different sources in alignment. To enhance robustness, we employ efficient data preprocessing and augmentation using large language models while incorporating hard negative sampling to improve representation learning. We evaluate our approach on monolingual and crosslingual benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and fact-checking performance over baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to protein and RNA language models due to their restricted token expressiveness and proposes 'reflection pretraining' as a solution to enhance reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the benefits of CoT prompting, widely successful in NLP tasks, to biological sequence models by overcoming the challenge posed by limited token expressiveness in their languages.

Method: The authors introduce 'reflection pretraining,' which augments biological language models with additional 'thinking tokens,' enhancing their ability to perform intermediate reasoning and improve overall language expressiveness.

Result: The reflection pretraining approach enables protein models to self-correct and significantly improves their performance compared to standard pretraining methods.

Conclusion: Reflection pretraining enhances the applicability of CoT reasoning to protein models by increasing language expressiveness, leading to better reasoning abilities and performance outcomes in biological sequence modeling tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced task-solving capabilities in natural language processing with large language models. Unlike standard prompting, CoT encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, non-answer tokens, that help guide the model toward more accurate final outputs. These intermediate steps enable more complex reasoning processes such as error correction, memory management, future planning, and self-reflection. However, applying CoT to non-natural language domains, such as protein and RNA language models, is not yet possible, primarily due to the limited expressiveness of their token spaces (e.g., amino acid tokens). In this work, we propose and define the concept of language expressiveness: the ability of a given language, using its tokens and grammar, to encode information. We show that the limited expressiveness of protein language severely restricts the applicability of CoT-style reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce reflection pretraining, for the first time in a biological sequence model, which enables the model to engage in intermediate reasoning through the generation of auxiliary "thinking tokens" beyond simple answer tokens. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our augmented token set significantly enhances biological language expressiveness, thereby improving the overall reasoning capacity of the model. Experimentally, our pretraining approach teaches protein models to self-correct and leads to substantial performance gains compared to standard pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedMistake, a pipeline that creates a benchmark for mistakes by large language models (LLMs) in patient-doctor conversations, providing a dataset for single-shot QA evaluation and validated its accuracy with medical experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLMs in clinical settings is challenging due to the lack of automated methods to replicate and assess specific failures in their reasoning, safety, and patient-centeredness.

Method: The authors developed MedMistake, a pipeline that generates complex patient-doctor conversations using LLMs, judges them across multiple dimensions using LLM evaluators, and then converts identified errors into single-shot QA scenarios. They created and validated a dataset of errors using medical experts.

Result: They released two datasets: MedMistake-All with 3,390 single-shot QA errors, and the doctor-validated MedMistake-Bench with 211 questions. An evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs showed that GPT models, Claude, and Grok performed best on MedMistake-Bench.

Conclusion: MedMistake enables a systematic way to benchmark and improve the performance of LLMs in medical dialogue settings, potentially contributing to better safety and patient care in AI-assisted healthcare applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in clinical settings using multi-dimensional rubrics which quantify reasoning quality, safety, and patient-centeredness. Yet, replicating specific mistakes in other LLM models is not straightforward and often requires manual effort. We introduce MedMistake, an automatic pipeline that extracts mistakes LLMs make in patient-doctor conversations and converts them into a benchmark of single-shot QA pairs. Our pipeline (1) creates complex, conversational data between an LLM patient and LLM doctor, (2) runs an evaluation with a committee of 2 LLM judges across a variety of dimensions and (3) creates simplified single-shot QA scenarios from those mistakes. We release MedMistake-All, a dataset of 3,390 single-shot QA pairs where GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are currently failing to answer correctly, as judged by two LLM judges. We used medical experts to validate a subset of 211/3390 questions (MedMistake-Bench), which we used to run a final evaluation of 12 frontier LLMs: Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek-Chat, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Grok 4, Grok 4.1, Mistral Large. We found that GPT models, Claude and Grok obtained the best performance on MedMistake-Bench. We release both the doctor-validated benchmark (MedMistake-Bench), as well as the full dataset (MedMistake-All) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TheLumos/MedicalMistakeBenchmark.

### [54] [Distilling the Essence: Efficient Reasoning Distillation via Sequence Truncation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21002)
*Wei-Rui Chen,Vignesh Kothapalli,Ata Fatahibaarzi,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Zhipeng Wang,Muhammad Abdul-Mageed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimized approach for distilling reasoning capabilities from large language models by selectively focusing on chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens, reducing computational resources while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational expense of distilling reasoning abilities from large language models while maintaining quality.

Method: Selective distillation of CoT tokens and truncation of training sequences to prioritize early reasoning tokens.

Result: Training on only the first 50% of tokens retained around 94% of performance on math benchmarks, while cutting training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by approximately 50%.

Conclusion: Reasoning distillation benefits from an emphasis on initial reasoning tokens, offering an efficient computation-quality tradeoff mechanism.

Abstract: Distilling the reasoning capabilities from a large language model (LLM) to a smaller student model often involves training on substantial amounts of reasoning data. However, distillation over lengthy sequences with prompt (P), chain-of-thought (CoT), and answer (A) segments makes the process computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate how the allocation of supervision across different segments (P, CoT, A) affects student performance. Our analysis shows that selective knowledge distillation over only the CoT tokens can be effective when the prompt and answer information is encompassed by it. Building on this insight, we establish a truncation protocol to quantify computation-quality tradeoffs as a function of sequence length. We observe that training on only the first $50\%$ of tokens of every training sequence can retain, on average, $\approx94\%$ of full-sequence performance on math benchmarks while reducing training time, memory usage, and FLOPs by about $50\%$ each. These findings suggest that reasoning distillation benefits from prioritizing early reasoning tokens and provides a simple lever for computation-quality tradeoffs.

*Xiaofeng Shi,Qian Kou,Yuduo Li,Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SFTKey, a method balancing attention between Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and the final answer portions in LLM training, improving accuracy by over 5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to focus excessively on long CoT sequences, neglecting the critical final answer portion essential for task success and evaluation.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning approach: (1) standard SFT for initial format training and (2) fine-tuning focused solely on the final answer (Key portion) to optimize accuracy.

Result: SFTKey improves average accuracy by over 5%, maintaining correct output formats across benchmarks and model families.

Conclusion: SFTKey enables better balance in attention between reasoning sequences and answer-relevant tokens, enhancing LLM accuracy without sacrificing format correctness.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) component has become significant for complex reasoning tasks. However, in conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), the model could allocate disproportionately more attention to CoT sequences with excessive length. This reduces focus on the much shorter but essential Key portion-the final answer, whose correctness directly determines task success and evaluation quality. To address this limitation, we propose SFTKey, a two-stage training scheme. In the first stage, conventional SFT is applied to ensure proper output format, while in the second stage, only the Key portion is fine-tuned to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families demonstrate that SFTKey achieves an average accuracy improvement exceeding 5\% over conventional SFT, while preserving the ability to generate correct formats. Overall, this study advances LLM fine-tuning by explicitly balancing CoT learning with additional optimization on answer-relevant tokens.

### [56] [Semantic Refinement with LLMs for Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21106)
*Safal Thapaliya,Zehong Wang,Jiazheng Li,Ziming Li,Yanfang Ye,Chuxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAS, a framework integrating GNNs with LLMs to adaptively refine semantics for graph representation learning, addressing structure-semantics heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenge presented by varying predictive signals across graph-structured domains, where fixed model biases cannot generalize effectively.

Method: The DAS framework implements a feedback loop between a GNN and a LLM, with the GNN guiding LLM's semantic refinement. Refined data from the LLM is then used to improve the graph representation learning.

Result: DAS consistently improves learning on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs.

Conclusion: Data-centric semantic adaptation demonstrates effectiveness in accommodating structure-semantics heterogeneity without relying on fixed inductive model biases.

Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibit substantial heterogeneity in where their predictive signals originate: in some domains, node-level semantics dominate, while in others, structural patterns play a central role. This structure-semantics heterogeneity implies that no graph learning model with a fixed inductive bias can generalize optimally across diverse graph domains. However, most existing methods address this challenge from the model side by incrementally injecting new inductive biases, which remains fundamentally limited given the open-ended diversity of real-world graphs. In this work, we take a data-centric perspective and treat node semantics as a task-adaptive variable. We propose a Data-Adaptive Semantic Refinement framework DAS for graph representation learning, which couples a fixed graph neural network (GNN) and a large language model (LLM) in a closed feedback loop. The GNN provides implicit supervisory signals to guide the semantic refinement of LLM, and the refined semantics are fed back to update the same graph learner. We evaluate our approach on both text-rich and text-free graphs. Results show consistent improvements on structure-dominated graphs while remaining competitive on semantics-rich graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric semantic adaptation under structure-semantics heterogeneity.

*Eduard Stefan Dinuta,Iustin Sirbu,Traian Rebedea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using semi-supervised learning to enhance safety tasks in large language models, focusing on leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data while emphasizing task-specific data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the safety of large language models is challenging due to the reliance on large datasets, potential data labeling issues, and the common inclusion of synthetic data.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised learning approach that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled data, analyzing its impact on prompts and responses, and emphasizing task-specific data augmentation.

Result: Semi-supervised techniques with task-specific augmentations significantly improve performance on safety-related tasks compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: Utilizing semi-supervised learning and task-specific augmentations offers an effective solution to address data challenges in safety classifier training for large language models, thereby enhancing their safety performance.

Abstract: Safety for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an ongoing research focus since their emergence and is even more relevant nowadays with the increasing capacity of those models. Currently, there are several guardrails in place for all public LLMs and multiple proposed datasets for training safety classifiers. However, training these safety classifiers relies on large quantities of labeled data, which can be problematic to acquire, prone to labeling errors, or often include synthetic data. To address these issues, we suggest a different approach: utilizing semi-supervised learning techniques, which leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, to improve the performance on the safety task. We analyze the improvements that these techniques can offer for both prompts given to Large Language Models and the responses to those requests. Moreover, since augmentation is the central part of semi-supervised algorithms, we demonstrate the importance of using task-specific augmentations, which significantly increase the performance when compared to general-purpose augmentation techniques.

*Sichun Luo,Yi Huang,Mukai Li,Shichang Meng,Fengyuan Liu,Zefa Hu,Junlan Feng,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClarifyMT-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for multi-turn clarification in ambiguous scenarios with diverse user personas. The study reveals LLMs under-clarify and degrade in performance as dialogue depth increases, and proposes ClarifyAgent to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLM clarification behavior in realistic, multi-turn interaction settings, especially under conditions of ambiguity and non-cooperative users.

Method: A hybrid LLM-human pipeline was used to generate 6,120 multi-turn dialogues grounded in an ambiguity taxonomy and incorporating diverse user personas. Ten LLMs were evaluated, and a new approach called ClarifyAgent was designed to decompose clarification processes.

Result: The evaluation showed that LLMs often under-clarify by responding prematurely, with performance declining in deeper dialogues. ClarifyAgent significantly improved robustness under various ambiguity conditions.

Conclusion: ClarifyMT-Bench provides a rigorous framework for analyzing when LLMs should ask clarifying questions or provide answers, addressing ambiguity in real-world interactions and introducing improvement strategies like ClarifyAgent.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational assistants in open-domain, multi-turn settings, where users often provide incomplete or ambiguous information. However, existing LLM-focused clarification benchmarks primarily assume single-turn interactions or cooperative users, limiting their ability to evaluate clarification behavior in realistic settings. We introduce \textbf{ClarifyMT-Bench}, a benchmark for multi-turn clarification grounded in a five-dimensional ambiguity taxonomy and a set of six behaviorally diverse simulated user personas. Through a hybrid LLM-human pipeline, we construct 6,120 multi-turn dialogues capturing diverse ambiguity sources and interaction patterns. Evaluating ten representative LLMs uncovers a consistent under-clarification bias: LLMs tend to answer prematurely, and performance degrades as dialogue depth increases. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{ClarifyAgent}, an agentic approach that decomposes clarification into perception, forecasting, tracking, and planning, substantially improving robustness across ambiguity conditions. ClarifyMT-Bench establishes a reproducible foundation for studying when LLMs should ask, when they should answer, and how to navigate ambiguity in real-world human-LLM interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpidR-Adapt, a method for efficiently adapting speech models to new languages using minimal unlabeled data, inspired by human-like learning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human infants demonstrate data-efficient learning abilities in acquiring new language units, which far surpasses current self-supervised speech models. The motivation is to close this efficiency gap and create biologically inspired, data-efficient speech representations.

Method: The authors propose SpidR-Adapt using a Multi-task Adaptive Pretraining (MAdaPT) protocol and a heuristic solution called First-Order Bi-Level Optimization (FOBLO) to adapt models with minimal computational costs and stabilize training with interleaved supervision.

Result: SpidR-Adapt achieves significant improvements in phonemic discriminability and spoken language modeling tasks using less than 1 hour of target-language audio, showing data-efficiency over 100 times better than standard training methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of SpidR-Adapt for low-resource speech learning, paving the way for biologically inspired and architecture-agnostic approaches in speech representation. The code and models are open-sourced for further use.

Abstract: Human infants, with only a few hundred hours of speech exposure, acquire basic units of new languages, highlighting a striking efficiency gap compared to the data-hungry self-supervised speech models. To address this gap, this paper introduces SpidR-Adapt for rapid adaptation to new languages using minimal unlabeled data. We cast such low-resource speech representation learning as a meta-learning problem and construct a multi-task adaptive pre-training (MAdaPT) protocol which formulates the adaptation process as a bi-level optimization framework. To enable scalable meta-training under this framework, we propose a novel heuristic solution, first-order bi-level optimization (FOBLO), avoiding heavy computation costs. Finally, we stabilize meta-training by using a robust initialization through interleaved supervision which alternates self-supervised and supervised objectives. Empirically, SpidR-Adapt achieves rapid gains in phonemic discriminability (ABX) and spoken language modeling (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC), improving over in-domain language models after training on less than 1h of target-language audio, over $100\times$ more data-efficient than standard training. These findings highlight a practical, architecture-agnostic path toward biologically inspired, data-efficient representations. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr-adapt.

*Divij Dudeja,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional transformers struggle with dense Engineering Manuals (EMs). SMART offers a structured approach, reducing errors and improving accuracy while utilizing fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge arises from dense and lengthy Engineering Manuals that overwhelm users and lead traditional transformers to incorrect and inefficient memorization of facts.

Method: SMART uses a hierarchical approach: (1) Syntax-aware fact extraction through Tree LSTM; (2) Indexed memory in MANN for storing rational facts as vectors; (3) A 6-layer Transformer for fusing retrieved facts for responses.

Result: SMART has 64-69% fewer parameters than GPT-2 and BERT, achieves 21.3% higher accuracy, and provides faster and more reliable answers with reduced hallucinations in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: SMART is an efficient and accurate transformer model for processing dense Engineering Manuals, offering an effective alternative to traditional off-the-shelf transformers.

Abstract: The user of Engineering Manuals (EM) finds it difficult to read EM s because they are long, have a dense format which includes written documents, step by step procedures, and standard parameter lists for engineering equipment. Off the shelf transformers, especially compact ones, treat this material as a flat stream of tokens. This approach leads to confident but incorrect numeric answers and forces the models to memorize separate facts inefficiently. SMART (Structured Memory and Reasoning Transformer) offers a different and practical solution to the above problem. SMART structures its processing by using a hierarchical approach, and is based upon three main job categories (1) A syntax-aware Fact Extractor (Grammarian) Tree LSTM which extracts facts as subject relation object relations from EM sentences (2) A compact indexed memory MANN (Memory Augmented Neural Network) that indexes these Rational Subject Relation Objects as 384 dimensional vectors that are associated with the source of the information, and (3) A 6 layer Transformer that learns to fuse the previously retrieved facts into its generated response. The entire SMART model utilizes 45.51M parameters, which is 64% less than GPT-2 (124M) and 69% less than BERT (133M), and it achieves a 21.3% higher accuracy than GPT-2, indicating that SMART fits the data better with the least amount of processing requirements. SMART employs dual modes of inference an indexed fast path for known documents (sub-second answer times) and an indexed dynamic path assisted by RAGs for new uploads (FAISS Top 20 results with memory severed at 64 slots). In real world deployment, this framework leads to more well supported results with reduced hallucinations than comparable small transformer models.

*Felix Draxler,Justus Will,Farrin Marouf Sofian,Theofanis Karaletsos,Sameer Singh,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PTP is a framework for parallel token prediction in language models, improving performance by jointly predicting multiple tokens and reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the latency bottlenecks in autoregressive decoding and the limitations caused by independence assumptions in existing multi-token prediction methods.

Method: The paper introduces Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), which jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in one step by integrating sampling into the transformer model. It uses either distillation of existing models or inverse autoregressive training for learning.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results in speculative decoding on the Spec-Bench dataset, processing over four tokens per step with Vicuna-7B.

Conclusion: PTP's universality demonstrates that parallel generation of long sequences in language models is possible without compromising modeling power.

Abstract: We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token prediction methods. We prove that PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions. PTP is trained either by distilling an existing model or through inverse autoregressive training without a teacher. Experimentally, we achieve state-of-the-art speculative decoding performance on Vicuna-7B by accepting over four tokens per step on Spec-Bench. The universality of our framework indicates that parallel generation of long sequences is feasible without loss of modeling power.

*Xinhe Wang,Jin Huang,Xingjian Zhang,Tianhao Wang,Jiaqi W. Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that performance gaps in reasoning benchmarks like ARC can be largely attributed to visual perception challenges rather than reasoning deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To correctly identify whether reasoning ability or visual perception is the main limiting factor in AI performance on ARC-style tasks.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage experimental pipeline that separates visual perception (image-to-description conversion) from reasoning (rule induction based on descriptions).

Result: Experiments on benchmarks such as Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO show that most failures in vision-language models come from perception errors (around 80%).

Conclusion: The study concludes that ARC-style benchmarks confound perception and reasoning, overstating reasoning deficiencies, and calls for benchmarks that separately evaluate these elements.

Abstract: Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain challenging for frontier vision-language models (VLMs), a gap commonly attributed to deficiencies in machine reasoning. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the gap arises primarily from limitations in visual perception rather than from shortcomings in inductive reasoning.
  To verify this hypothesis, we introduce a two-stage experimental pipeline that explicitly separates perception and reasoning. In the perception stage, each image is independently converted into a natural-language description, while in the reasoning stage a model induces and applies rules using these descriptions. This design prevents leakage of cross-image inductive signals and isolates reasoning from perception bottlenecks. Across three ARC-style datasets, Mini-ARC, ACRE, and Bongard-LOGO, we show that the perception capability is the dominant factor underlying the observed performance gap by comparing the two-stage pipeline with against standard end-to-end one-stage evaluation. Manual inspection of reasoning traces in the VLM outputs further reveals that approximately 80 percent of model failures stem from perception errors. Together, these results demonstrate that ARC-style benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning challenges and that observed performance gaps may overstate deficiencies in machine reasoning. Our findings underscore the need for evaluation protocols that disentangle perception from reasoning when assessing progress in machine intelligence.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve code embedding capabilities in large language models by overcoming limitations like bottlenecks in EOS-based embeddings and restricted embedding dimensions.

Method: C2LLM uses Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, integrates a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module, and is trained on three million publicly available datasets to enhance sequence embedding.

Abstract: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the sensitivity of Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) to decoding order by introducing the Denoising Entropy metric to optimize and evaluate generative processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance and stabilize the output quality of MDMs by addressing their sensitivity to decoding order, improving their utility in non-autoregressive generation tasks.

Method: The authors propose Denoising Entropy, a computable metric to measure cumulative predictive uncertainty, and develop two optimization approaches for decoding paths: post-hoc selection and real-time guidance.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve generation quality, as evidenced by boosts in accuracy across tasks like reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks.

Conclusion: Denoising Entropy provides a principled way to understand and guide MDM generation, transforming uncertainty into an advantage for high-quality output discovery.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a computable metric that serves as an internal signal for evaluating generative process. Leveraging this metric, we propose two algorithms designed to optimize the decoding path: a post-hoc selection method and a real-time guidance strategy. Experiments demonstrate that our entropy-guided methods significantly improve generation quality, consistently boosting accuracy on challenging reasoning, planning, and code benchmarks. Our work establishes Denoising Entropy as a principled tool for understanding and controlling generation, effectively turning the uncertainty in MDMs from a liability into a key advantage for discovering high-quality solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VL4Gaze, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on gaze understanding, emphasizing the need for task-specific training to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack systematic evaluation and training for interpreting human gaze, an essential aspect of social interaction and attention cues in visual scenes.

Method: VL4Gaze benchmark with 489K question-answer pairs across 124K images is proposed to assess VLMs on four tasks: gaze object description, gaze direction, gaze point location, and ambiguous question recognition.

Result: Results indicate that VLMs perform poorly in gaze-related tasks without targeted supervision, but training with VL4Gaze substantially improves their performance.

Conclusion: Task-specific multi-task supervision is crucial for developing gaze understanding in vision-language models, and VL4Gaze provides an essential resource to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Human gaze provides essential cues for interpreting attention, intention, and social interaction in visual scenes, yet gaze understanding remains largely unexplored in current vision-language models (VLMs). While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.

Motivation: To address the challenge of trash detection using machine learning while adhering to resource constraints of TinyML and edge/IoT devices.

Method: The research introduces an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework with a ResDets supernet structure for generating deployment-ready detectors optimized for different hardware constraints.

Result: The strongest detector achieved 19.5 mAP50, outperforming prior detectors by up to 3.6 mAP50 while minimizing parameters. Specialized variants demonstrated significant energy, latency, and power reductions on the MAX78002 microcontroller.

Conclusion: The TrashDet framework provides scalable and efficient detectors for TinyML deployment, significantly advancing resource-efficient trash detection while offering various optimization options.

Abstract: This paper addresses trash detection on the TACO dataset under strict TinyML constraints using an iterative hardware-aware neural architecture search framework targeting edge and IoT devices. The proposed method constructs a Once-for-All-style ResDets supernet and performs iterative evolutionary search that alternates between backbone and neck/head optimization, supported by a population passthrough mechanism and an accuracy predictor to reduce search cost and improve stability. This framework yields a family of deployment-ready detectors, termed TrashDets. On a five-class TACO subset (paper, plastic, bottle, can, cigarette), the strongest variant, TrashDet-l, achieves 19.5 mAP50 with 30.5M parameters, improving accuracy by up to 3.6 mAP50 over prior detectors while using substantially fewer parameters. The TrashDet family spans 1.2M to 30.5M parameters with mAP50 values between 11.4 and 19.5, providing scalable detector options for diverse TinyML deployment budgets on resource-constrained hardware. On the MAX78002 microcontroller with the TrashNet dataset, two specialized variants, TrashDet-ResNet and TrashDet-MBNet, jointly dominate the ai87-fpndetector baseline, with TrashDet-ResNet achieving 7525~$μ$J energy per inference at 26.7 ms latency and 37.45 FPS, and TrashDet-MBNet improving mAP50 by 10.2%; together they reduce energy consumption by up to 88%, latency by up to 78%, and average power by up to 53% compared to existing TinyML detectors.

TL;DR: This paper introduces OccuFly, the first aerial Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) benchmark using camera data, targeting elevated viewpoints and minimizing reliance on LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research and benchmarks for SSC in aerial scenarios due to UAV limitations like restricted LiDAR usage and sparse point clouds.

Method: The authors develop OccuFly, using camera-based 3D reconstruction and automated label transfer for efficient annotation instead of manual 3D labeling.

Result: OccuFly dataset includes real-world aerial data with varying altitudes, seasons, and scenes, supporting 22 semantic classes. State-of-the-art models are benchmarked, showcasing challenges in aerial SSC.

Conclusion: OccuFly provides a robust benchmark for elevated SSC, addressing limitations in UAV LiDAR usage and advancing aerial 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is crucial for 3D perception in mobile robotics, as it enables holistic scene understanding by jointly estimating dense volumetric occupancy and per-voxel semantics. Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.

### [68] [NULLBUS: Multimodal Mixed-Supervision for Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Nullable Global-Local Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20783)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NullBUS is a multimodal framework for breast ultrasound segmentation that handles both cases of available and missing text prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing breast ultrasound datasets lack reliable metadata or text prompts, limiting robust segmentation performance and applicability in computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: NullBUS framework leverages a mixed-supervision strategy by introducing nullable prompts, which use learnable null embeddings and presence masks for fallback processing when text prompts are unavailable.

Result: NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating strong segmentation performance across three public breast ultrasound datasets.

Conclusion: NullBUS effectively handles mixed prompt availability and improves segmentation robustness, marking an advancement in breast ultrasound imaging analysis.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation provides lesion boundaries essential for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning. While promptable methods can improve segmentation performance and tumor delineation when text or spatial prompts are available, many public BUS datasets lack reliable metadata or reports, constraining training to small multimodal subsets and reducing robustness. We propose NullBUS, a multimodal mixed-supervision framework that learns from images with and without prompts in a single model. To handle missing text, we introduce nullable prompts, implemented as learnable null embeddings with presence masks, enabling fallback to image-only evidence when metadata are absent and the use of text when present. Evaluated on a unified pool of three public BUS datasets, NullBUS achieves a mean IoU of 0.8568 and a mean Dice of 0.9103, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance under mixed prompt availability.

### [69] [Learning to Sense for Driving: Joint Optics-Sensor-Model Co-Design for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20815)
*Reeshad Khan amd John Gauch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework optimizing optics, sensors, and neural networks for autonomous driving perception, resulting in improved segmentation performance, particularly in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in traditional autonomous driving pipelines where fixed optics and ISPs focus on human-viewable imagery, discarding information crucial for machine semantics.

Method: The paper introduces an end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline that integrates learnable layers like optics modeling and color filter arrays with segmentation networks, optimized for semantic segmentation tasks.

Result: The approach improved segmentation quality over traditional pipelines, particularly for hard-to-detect classes under challenging conditions such as low light, while maintaining compact model size and high FPS.

Conclusion: The unified RAW-to-task framework enhances efficiency and robustness in machine perception, demonstrating its potential for deployable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving pipelines decouple camera design from downstream perception, relying on fixed optics and handcrafted ISPs that prioritize human viewable imagery rather than machine semantics. This separation discards information during demosaicing, denoising, or quantization, while forcing models to adapt to sensor artifacts. We present a task-driven co-design framework that unifies optics, sensor modeling, and lightweight semantic segmentation networks into a single end-to-end RAW-to-task pipeline. Building on DeepLens[19], our system integrates realistic cellphone-scale lens models, learnable color filter arrays, Poisson-Gaussian noise processes, and quantization, all optimized directly for segmentation objectives. Evaluations on KITTI-360 show consistent mIoU improvements over fixed pipelines, with optics modeling and CFA learning providing the largest gains, especially for thin or low-light-sensitive classes. Importantly, these robustness gains are achieved with a compact ~1M-parameter model running at ~28 FPS, demonstrating edge deployability. Visual and quantitative analyses further highlight how co-designed sensors adapt acquisition to semantic structure, sharpening boundaries and maintaining accuracy under blur, noise, and low bit-depth. Together, these findings establish full-stack co-optimization of optics, sensors, and networks as a principled path toward efficient, reliable, and deployable perception in autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces CHAMMI-75, a diverse multi-channel microscopy image dataset, for training adaptive cellular morphology models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models for cell morphology quantification struggle with cross-study reusability because they are trained on single imaging types and limited conditions.

Method: CHAMMI-75 dataset, comprising heterogeneous images from 75 biological studies, was curated to train channel-adaptive cellular morphology models.

Result: Training models with CHAMMI-75 highlighted improved performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks due to increased diversity in image modalities.

Conclusion: CHAMMI-75 provides a resource to advance adaptable and robust cellular morphology models for broader biological studies.

Abstract: Quantifying cell morphology using images and machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool to study the response of cells to treatments. However, models used to quantify cellular morphology are typically trained with a single microscopy imaging type. This results in specialized models that cannot be reused across biological studies because the technical specifications do not match (e.g., different number of channels), or because the target experimental conditions are out of distribution. Here, we present CHAMMI-75, an open access dataset of heterogeneous, multi-channel microscopy images from 75 diverse biological studies. We curated this resource from publicly available sources to investigate cellular morphology models that are channel-adaptive and can process any microscopy image type. Our experiments show that training with CHAMMI-75 can improve performance in multi-channel bioimaging tasks primarily because of its high diversity in microscopy modalities. This work paves the way to create the next generation of cellular morphology models for biological studies.

*Putu Indah Githa Cahyani,Komang David Dananjaya Suartana,Novanto Yudistira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive visual preprocessing method for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to reduce inference latency and computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face high computational costs, particularly with high-resolution visual inputs, making efficient deployment challenging.

Method: The method dynamically adjusts image input resolution and spatial coverage using content-aware analysis, integrating it with FastVLM without retraining.

Result: The adaptive preprocessing achieved over 50% reduction in inference time, a 55% decrease in visual token count, and significant efficiency improvements on the DocVQA dataset.

Conclusion: Input-aware preprocessing is a lightweight, effective strategy to enhance the deployment efficiency of Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on multimodal reasoning tasks, but their deployment remains challenging due to high inference latency and computational cost, particularly when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models. To facilitate reproducibility, our implementation is provided as a fork of the FastVLM repository, incorporating the files for the proposed method, and is available at https://github.com/kmdavidds/mlfastlm.

### [72] [AI-Augmented Pollen Recognition in Optical and Holographic Microscopy for Veterinary Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12101)
*Swarn S. Warshaneyan,Maksims Ivanovs,Blaž Cugmas,Inese Bērziņa,Laura Goldberga,Mindaugas Tamosiunas,Roberts Kadiķis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates automated pollen recognition using YOLOv8s and MobileNetV3L across two microscopy modalities, achieving high performance on optical data but lower results on DIHM. GAN-based augmentation improves object detection on DIHM images slightly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automated pollen recognition, particularly in digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images, which suffer from noise, artifacts, and dissimilar visual characteristics compared to bright-field images, and to reduce performance gaps.

Method: The study trained YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of optical and aligned DIHM images. Performance was improved on DIHM images through bounding box expansion and GAN-based synthetic data augmentation.

Result: The team achieved 91.3% detection mAP50 and 97% classification accuracy on optical images, but only 8.15% detection mAP50 and 50% classification accuracy on DIHM images. GAN-based augmentation improved DIHM detection to 15.4%, demonstrating limited progress.

Conclusion: GAN-based approaches can help reduce the performance gap in automated DIHM workflows for pollen recognition, suggesting incremental progress toward practical applications, particularly in veterinary imaging.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

*Md Zabirul Islam,Md Motaleb Hossen Manik,Ge Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ALIVE, an interactive video engine that enhances traditional lecture videos with real-time avatar-guided explanations and multimodal interactions, all while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lecture videos lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, requiring learners to search externally during confusion. Recent advancements offer opportunities, but existing systems fail in critical integration and privacy factors.

Method: The authors developed ALIVE, a locally operated system integrating ASR transcription, LLM refinement, neural head synthesis, semantic similarity-based retrieval, and real-time avatar interactions to deliver explanations during paused lectures.

Result: ALIVE successfully tested on a medical imaging course, showing accurate and engaging multimodal real-time support, with evaluations providing positive results in retrieval accuracy, latency, and user experience.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI, combined with local deployment and content-aware retrieval, can transform recorded lectures into dynamic and interactive learning tools, offering significant pedagogical improvements.

Abstract: Traditional lecture videos offer flexibility but lack mechanisms for real-time clarification, forcing learners to search externally when confusion arises. Recent advances in large language models and neural avatars provide new opportunities for interactive learning, yet existing systems typically lack lecture awareness, rely on cloud-based services, or fail to integrate retrieval and avatar-delivered explanations in a unified, privacy-preserving pipeline.
  We present ALIVE, an Avatar-Lecture Interactive Video Engine that transforms passive lecture viewing into a dynamic, real-time learning experience. ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.
  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.
  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 3D pipeline detection framework using 3D GPR, enhancing accuracy, robustness, and recognition of small-scale targets through advanced methods and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, such as weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy for small targets, and poor robustness in complex scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes a three-view feature evaluation method using B/C/D-Scan correlation strategies, introduces the DCO-YOLO framework with enhanced feature extraction, and a 3D-DIoU spatial matching algorithm for automated annotation association.

Result: The proposed method achieves high accuracy (96.2%), recall (93.3%), and mean average precision (96.7%), outperforming baseline models in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework combines deep learning with 3D GPR physical features, offering reliable solutions for pipeline detection and localization, validated by experiments and visualizations.

Abstract: To address the issues of weak correlation between multi-view features, low recognition accuracy of small-scale targets, and insufficient robustness in complex scenarios in underground pipeline detection using 3D GPR, this paper proposes a 3D pipeline intelligent detection framework. First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features. This study integrates deep learning optimization strategies with the physical characteristics of 3D GPR, offering an efficient and reliable novel technical framework for the intelligent recognition and localization of underground pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of existing NeRV methods when applied to high-resolution 360-degree videos, including excessive memory usage and slow decoding, which hinder real-time applications.

Method: Introduces NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that focuses on viewport-specific decoding rather than reconstructing entire panoramic frames. It includes a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on user viewpoint and time.

Result: Achieves a 7x reduction in memory usage and 2.5x faster decoding compared to HNeRV, while also improving image quality in 6K-resolution videos.

Conclusion: NeRV360 efficiently handles high-resolution 360-degree video decoding with significant performance gains in speed, memory usage, and image quality, making it more practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations for videos (NeRV) have shown strong potential for video compression. However, applying NeRV to high-resolution 360-degree videos causes high memory usage and slow decoding, making real-time applications impractical. We propose NeRV360, an end-to-end framework that decodes only the user-selected viewport instead of reconstructing the entire panoramic frame. Unlike conventional pipelines, NeRV360 integrates viewport extraction into decoding and introduces a spatial-temporal affine transform module for conditional decoding based on viewpoint and time. Experiments on 6K-resolution videos show that NeRV360 achieves a 7-fold reduction in memory consumption and a 2.5-fold increase in decoding speed compared to HNeRV, a representative prior work, while delivering better image quality in terms of objective metrics.

*Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Zhelin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel PEFT method, called Domain Representation Injection (DRI), for Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID), leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) while reducing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address significant modality discrepancies in CMS Re-ID without relying on large-scale paired datasets and to explore the potential of VFMs for bridging modality gaps effectively.

Method: The paper proposes DRI, a PEFT strategy that employs a lightweight Offset Encoder to extract rich domain-specific representations. These are adaptively modulated and injected into intermediate layers through additive fusion, preserving the pre-trained VFM weights.

Result: The method achieves State-of-the-Art performance with minimal trainable parameters, notably attaining 57.9% and 60.5% mAP on the HOSS-ReID dataset using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed DRI method effectively addresses modality discrepancies and achieves superior performance for CMS Re-ID tasks with minimal parameter updates on VFMs, showcasing its efficiency and potential for further use.

Abstract: Cross-Modality Ship Re-Identification (CMS Re-ID) is critical for achieving all-day and all-weather maritime target tracking, yet it is fundamentally challenged by significant modality discrepancies. Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters. For instance, on the HOSS-ReID dataset, we attain 57.9\% and 60.5\% mAP using only 1.54M and 7.05M parameters, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/TingfengXian/DRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer by addressing the limitations of existing methods in multimodal and multi-temporal fusion, which are often inefficient and simplistic.

Method: The paper proposes the Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which includes a Global-Local Feature Encoder for capturing different levels of nodule characteristics, a Dual-Graph Construction method to organize multimodal features, and a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module for effective information integration.

Result: Experiments on the newly introduced NLST-cmst dataset and curated datasets indicate that DGSAN outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in classifying pulmonary nodules with high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DGSAN method demonstrates significant improvements in the classification of pulmonary nodules, confirming its potential as a promising tool for lung cancer diagnostics.

Abstract: Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) handling low-bitrate compressed images, introducing a benchmark and a universal VLM adapter to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs excel with high-quality images, but their ability to interpret highly compressed, low-bitrate images is underexplored. This gap hinders their efficiency in real-world applications with varying image qualities.

Method: The authors created a comprehensive benchmark with over one million compressed images and analyzed performance gaps in VLMs. They categorized performance issues into information loss during compression and generalization failure of VLMs. A universal VLM adaptor was proposed to address the generalization gap.

Result: The universal VLM adaptor improved performance across images compressed with various codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and enhancement technique significantly advance VLM capabilities with compressed images, offering insights for further development in this area.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the growing demand for their applications, efficient compression of the image inputs has become increasingly important. Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'PanoGrounder,' a framework for 3D Visual Grounding that enhances reasoning by combining panoramic representation and pretrained 2D vision-language models (VLMs), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised 3D Visual Grounding models struggle with generalization due to limited 3D vision-language datasets and reasoning capabilities, hindering advances in vision-language perception for robotics.

Method: PanoGrounder uses panoramic renderings with 3D semantic-geometric features as an intermediate representation. A three-stage pipeline combines panoramic viewpoint placement, grounding a text query using VLMs, and fusing outputs into a 3D bounding box.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets, showing improved generalization across unseen datasets and text rephrasings.

Conclusion: By leveraging panoramic representations and pretrained VLMs, PanoGrounder improves 3D Visual Grounding, bridging the gap between 2D and 3D reasoning while addressing generalization challenges in the field.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) is a critical bridge from vision-language perception to robotics, requiring both language understanding and 3D scene reasoning. Traditional supervised models leverage explicit 3D geometry but exhibit limited generalization, owing to the scarcity of 3D vision-language datasets and the limited reasoning capabilities compared to modern vision-language models (VLMs). We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanRefer and Nr3D, and demonstrates superior generalization to unseen 3D datasets and text rephrasings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMC-Mamba improves image fusion performance efficiently using self-supervised methods, generalizable across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a general image fusion framework enhancing task performance without added complexity.

Method: Proposed SMC-Mamba framework includes MAFE for feature enhancement, MCCM for cross-modal fusion, and BSCL loss for self-supervised learning.

Result: Extensive experiment results show superior performance compared to SOTA in various fusion tasks and downstream visual applications.

Conclusion: The SMC-Mamba framework is effective for multi-task image fusion, preserving information while boosting downstream task performance.

Abstract: Image fusion integrates complementary information from different modalities to generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Unlike task-specific techniques that primarily focus on consolidating inter-modal information, general image fusion needs to address a wide range of tasks while improving performance without increasing complexity. To achieve this, we propose SMC-Mamba, a Self-supervised Multiplex Consensus Mamba framework for general image fusion. Specifically, the Modality-Agnostic Feature Enhancement (MAFE) module preserves fine details through adaptive gating and enhances global representations via spatial-channel and frequency-rotational scanning. The Multiplex Consensus Cross-modal Mamba (MCCM) module enables dynamic collaboration among experts, reaching a consensus to efficiently integrate complementary information from multiple modalities. The cross-modal scanning within MCCM further strengthens feature interactions across modalities, facilitating seamless integration of critical information from both sources. Additionally, we introduce a Bi-level Self-supervised Contrastive Learning Loss (BSCL), which preserves high-frequency information without increasing computational overhead while simultaneously boosting performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) image fusion algorithms in tasks such as infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion, as well as downstream visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address feature compression issues in 3D Gaussian Splatting used for open-vocabulary segmentation, which cause information loss and negatively impact segmentation quality.

Method: The method involves Q-Render, which sparsely samples dominant 3D Gaussians along a ray for efficient rendering, and GS-Net, a generalizable neural network predicting Gaussian features.

Result: Experiments on ScanNet and LeRF show the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving real-time rendering with ~43.7x speedup on 512-dimensional feature maps.

Conclusion: Q-Render and GS-Net improve rendering efficiency and segmentation quality, demonstrating significant advancements in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have successfully extended Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) to the 3D domain by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps. Code will be made publicly available.

*Shengguang Wu,Xiaohan Wang,Yuhui Zhang,Hao Zhu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a framework for 3D spatial reasoning that evolves tools based on experience rather than speculative creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of spatial reasoning in 3D scenes demand precise geometric calculations which current vision-language models struggle with. Current methods, which rely on fixed or speculative toolsets, result in suboptimal utilization and performance.

Method: TVP solves problems initially with basic tools and creates an Example Library from its experiences. It identifies recurring patterns in solutions to develop higher-level, reusable tools, expanding its Tool Library over time for improved problem-solving capabilities.

Result: TVP outperforms GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best system by 11% on Omni3D-Bench. Tools learned by TVP were used 5x more frequently as core dependencies, and the framework showed superior generalization to unseen spatial tasks on SpatialScore-Hard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Experience-driven transductive tool creation is an effective paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents, enabling them to handle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. Code has been released for further use and validation.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D scenes requires precise geometric calculations that challenge vision-language models. Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks. We release our code at https://transductive-visualprogram.github.io/.

*Hongxing Fan,Shuyu Zhao,Jiayang Ao,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework to improve amodal completion using collaborative reasoning, self-correcting verification, and diverse hypothesis generation, leading to better results compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in amodal completion, specifically maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity while addressing errors and ambiguities inherent in prior approaches.

Method: The method introduces a decoupled reasoning framework with semantic planning and visual synthesis, alongside mechanisms like self-correcting agents and diverse hypothesis generation for improved predictions.

Result: The framework significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods in experiments and introduced the MAC-Score as a robust evaluation metric validated by human judgments.

Conclusion: This work achieves visually and semantically coherent synthesis in amodal completion tasks and establishes new benchmarks in performance evaluation.

Abstract: Amodal completion, the task of inferring invisible object parts, faces significant challenges in maintaining semantic consistency and structural integrity. Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

### [84] [Beyond Artifacts: Real-Centric Envelope Modeling for Reliable AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20937)
*Ruiqi Liu,Yi Han,Zhengbo Zhang,Liwei Yao,Zhiyuan Yan,Jialiang Shen,ZhiJin Chen,Boyi Sun,Lubin Weng,Jing Dong,Yan Wang,Shu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM) to detect synthetic images under real-world conditions, outperforming existing methods by focusing on the robust distribution of real images rather than generator artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve synthetic image detection, addressing the challenges posed by evolving generative models and real-world image degradations, which render current detection methods ineffective.

Method: The proposed method involves Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), using feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to create near-real samples and employing an envelope estimator to define a boundary around the real image manifold for robust detection.

Result: REM demonstrates an average 7.5% improvement over state-of-the-art detectors across eight benchmarks and remains reliable even under severe degradation conditions in the RealChain benchmark.

Conclusion: REM establishes a new foundation for synthetic image detection in real-world conditions, with exceptional generalization across generators and degradations, and promises to further the field with the release of its code and benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has intensified the need for reliable and robust detection under real-world conditions. However, existing detectors often overfit to generator-specific artifacts and remain highly sensitive to real-world degradations. As generative architectures evolve and images undergo multi-round cross-platform sharing and post-processing (chain degradations), these artifact cues become obsolete and harder to detect. To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions. The code and the RealChain benchmark will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [85] [SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975)
*Yujin Noh,Inho Jake Park,Chigon Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPOT, a map-guided LLM agent designed to enhance vehicle tracking across multi-CCTV environments, addressing blind spot issues without relying on prior training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome structural limitations of CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems, especially around blind spots due to gaps between cameras and restricted Fields of View, which lead to trajectory loss and unreliable path prediction.

Method: SPOT utilizes road structures, CCTV placement data, and 2D spatial coordinate documents with chunking techniques for real-time querying. It integrates spatial map data, vehicle motion patterns, and logical inference using beam search to predict vehicle trajectories across blind spots.

Result: Tests on the CARLA simulator demonstrated the accuracy of SPOT in predicting the next CCTV location after blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than current systems.

Conclusion: SPOT improves real-time vehicle tracking reliability in multi-CCTV environments, even in blind spots, presenting a promising solution compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.

*Zeqing Song,Zhongmiao Yan,Junyuan Deng,Songpengcheng Xia,Xiang Mu,Jingyi Xu,Qi Wu,Ling Pei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework combining sparse and dense grid representations for efficient, large-scale neural LiDAR mapping, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in large-scale LiDAR mapping, such as reliance on dense implicit representations, underutilization of geometric structure, and inefficiencies in voxel-guided methods.

Method: The proposed method, XGrid-Mapping, combines sparse grids for geometric structure with dense implicit grids for richer scene representation. It also includes a VDB structure for computational efficiency, a distillation-based alignment strategy for submap consistency, and a dynamic removal module to enhance robustness.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that XGrid-Mapping delivers superior mapping quality and efficiency, overcoming the limitations of voxel-guided methods. It outperforms the existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

Conclusion: XGrid-Mapping provides an efficient and robust solution for real-time, large-scale neural LiDAR mapping by effectively combining explicit and implicit representations, ensuring consistency and enhanced mapping performance.

Abstract: Large-scale incremental mapping is fundamental to the development of robust and reliable autonomous systems, as it underpins incremental environmental understanding with sequential inputs for navigation and decision-making. LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module. Extensive experiments show that our approach delivers superior mapping quality while overcoming the efficiency limitations of voxel-guided methods, thereby outperforming existing state-of-the-art mapping methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel data synthesis pipeline to augment rare pulmonary lesion classes in X-rays using diffusion model techniques and presents enhanced diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with rare pulmonary lesions in X-ray imaging due to limited exemplar data, impacting diagnostic precision.

Method: A diffusion model is trained on normal X-rays, which is then employed to inpaint diseased images, preserving rare lesion classes; enhanced further by Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance and Progressive Incremental Learning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on MIMIC and CheXpert datasets indicate superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves diagnostic quality for rare pulmonary lesions, setting a new performance standard for clinical imaging models.

Abstract: Long-tailed pulmonary anomalies in chest radiography present formidable diagnostic challenges. Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the public lung datasets MIMIC and CheXpert demonstrate that the proposed method sets a new benchmark in performance.

TL;DR: PUFM++ is an enhanced generative model framework for point cloud upsampling, improving geometric accuracy, robustness, and downstream task consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations, which are critical for many applications.

Method: PUFM++ uses a two-stage flow-matching strategy, adaptive time scheduling for efficient sampling, on-manifold constraints to align generated points, and a recurrent interface network for hierarchical feature refinement.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art results in point cloud upsampling with superior visual and quantitative performance, demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PUFM++ significantly improves the fidelity, robustness, and task relevance in point cloud reconstruction, advancing the field of generative modeling for 3D data.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated strong promise for high-quality point cloud upsampling. In this work, we present PUFM++, an enhanced flow-matching framework for reconstructing dense and accurate point clouds from sparse, noisy, and partial observations. PUFM++ improves flow matching along three key axes: (i) geometric fidelity, (ii) robustness to imperfect input, and (iii) consistency with downstream surface-based tasks. We introduce a two-stage flow-matching strategy that first learns a direct, straight-path flow from sparse inputs to dense targets, and then refines it using noise-perturbed samples to approximate the terminal marginal distribution better. To accelerate and stabilize inference, we propose a data-driven adaptive time scheduler that improves sampling efficiency based on interpolation behavior. We further impose on-manifold constraints during sampling to ensure that generated points remain aligned with the underlying surface. Finally, we incorporate a recurrent interface network~(RIN) to strengthen hierarchical feature interactions and boost reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world scans show that PUFM++ sets a new state of the art in point cloud upsampling, delivering superior visual fidelity and quantitative accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

*Xiangzuo Wu,Chengwei Ren,Jun Zhou,Xiu Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework for consistent material and normal estimation from multi-view images, introducing improved model generalization and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either disregard cross-view relationships or are computationally expensive, resulting in inconsistency and inefficiency in recovering scene-level geometry, materials, and illumination.

Method: The approach employs an alternating attention model to predict spatially varying properties like albedo and surface normals while capturing inter- and intra-view relationships. Additionally, a consistency-based finetuning strategy uses unlabeled real-world videos to improve multi-view coherence and robustness.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in material and normal estimation, multi-view consistency, and generalization to real-world scenes.

Conclusion: This efficient framework provides coherent and accurate scene-level inverse rendering, addressing the shortcomings of both single-view and computationally expensive multi-view methods.

Abstract: Multi-view inverse rendering aims to recover geometry, materials, and illumination consistently across multiple viewpoints. When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NExT-Vid proposes a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework focusing on masked next-frame prediction for advanced image and video representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual generative pretraining methods often fail to model temporal information effectively, limiting their ability in video analysis and semantic localization.

Method: NExT-Vid incorporates a context-isolated autoregressive predictor for semantic representation and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to improve generation quality.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that models using NExT-Vid outperform existing pretraining methods in visual representation learning with probing in classification tasks.

Conclusion: NExT-Vid achieves robust visual representation learning and addresses limitations in previous generative pretraining methods for improved downstream task performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing data augmentation methods, which often lack structural awareness and discard important semantics while improving robustness.

Method: Introducing GBGM, which uses Granular-ball Computing (GBC) for adaptive masking, preserving semantically rich regions and suppressing redundant areas through a hierarchical masking process.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show improved classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, proving the effectiveness and adaptability of GBGM.

Conclusion: GBGM offers a simple, model-agnostic solution that integrates well into existing deep learning frameworks and enhances robustness through structure-aware augmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but they still rely heavily on large-scale labeled data and tend to overfit when data are limited or distributions shift. Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges faced in existing video editing methods, such as temporal inconsistencies and high computational overheads, while maintaining high-quality editing performance.

Method: FluencyVE incorporates the Mamba time-series module into a pretrained Stable Diffusion video editing model, replaces temporal attention with global frame-level attention, applies low-rank approximation matrices, and uses a weighted averaging technique during training.

Result: FluencyVE achieves consistent video editing performance with lower computational costs, effectively editing attributes, subjects, and locations in various real-world videos.

Conclusion: FluencyVE provides a promising advancement for video editing by addressing key limitations of prior models and ensuring both effective and efficient editing capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation and editing. However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden. Experiments and analyses demonstrate promising results in editing various attributes, subjects, and locations in real-world videos.

Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns resulting from the misuse of personal portrait videos by advanced 3D-field TFG methods, for which no existing efficient defense mechanisms currently exist.

Method: The framework employs a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for efficiency and a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to optimize spatial-frequency perturbations for defense.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a 47x speed improvement over the fastest baseline, retains high video quality, and remains resilient to scaling and advanced purification attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a strong, efficient defense mechanism against 3D-field TFG threats, while maintaining video quality and computational efficiency, verified through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D-field video-referenced Talking Face Generation (TFG) methods synthesize high-fidelity personalized talking-face videos in real time by modeling 3D geometry and appearance from reference portrait video. This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving infrared-to-visible face recognition using a novel latent diffusion model and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face recognition systems perform poorly on infrared images due to the lack of proper training datasets and domain shifts.

Method: Proposed a latent diffusion-based model with a multi-attribute classifier for improved identity feature restoration and introduced the Self-attn Mamba module for better feature modeling and inference efficiency.

Result: Experimental results highlight superior performance on benchmark datasets in both image quality and identity preservation.

Conclusion: The novel methods introduced in this paper successfully address the challenges of Heterogeneous Face Recognition and enhance the effectiveness of infrared-based facial recognition systems.

Abstract: Modern surveillance systems increasingly rely on multi-wavelength sensors and deep neural networks to recognize faces in infrared images captured at night. However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a self-supervised paradigm for image denoising, to address issues in existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the conflict between removing correlated noise and preserving fine details in real-world image denoising, which current blind-spot network methods struggle to balance.

Method: NSP uses cross-scale training pairs where low-resolution, decorrelated sub-images are given to predict high-resolution targets that maintain detail. The approach also enables natural super-resolution for noisy images without additional training.

Result: NSP demonstrates superior performance to existing methods in denoising real-world images, effectively balancing noise reduction and fine detail preservation.

Conclusion: NSP provides a robust self-supervised solution for real-world image denoising, improving both decorrelation of noisy features and preservation of high-resolution details compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: Self-supervised real-world image denoising remains a fundamental challenge, arising from the antagonistic trade-off between decorrelating spatially structured noise and preserving high-frequency details. Existing blind-spot network (BSN) methods rely on pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to decorrelate noise, but aggressive downsampling fragments fine structures, while milder downsampling fails to remove correlated noise. To address this, we introduce Next-Scale Prediction (NSP), a novel self-supervised paradigm that decouples noise decorrelation from detail preservation. NSP constructs cross-scale training pairs, where BSN takes low-resolution, fully decorrelated sub-images as input to predict high-resolution targets that retain fine details. As a by-product, NSP naturally supports super-resolution of noisy images without retraining or modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSP achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising performance on real-world benchmarks, significantly alleviating the long-standing conflict between noise decorrelation and detail preservation.

Conclusion: KOREATECH-CGH is a valuable tool for advancing ML-based holography, applicable to training and evaluating cutting-edge ML models effectively.

Abstract: Machine learning-based computer-generated holography (ML-CGH) has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet progress is constrained by the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale hologram datasets. To address this, we present KOREATECH-CGH, a publicly available dataset comprising 6,000 pairs of RGB-D images and complex holograms across resolutions ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048, with depth ranges extending to the theoretical limits of the angular spectrum method for wide 3D scene coverage. To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively. We further validate the utility of KOREATECH-CGH through experiments on hologram generation and super-resolution using state-of-the-art ML models, confirming its applicability for training and evaluating next-generation ML-CGH systems.

*Zhijie Wang,Liangtian He,Qinghua Zhang,Jifei Miao,Liang-Jian Deng,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of the nuclear norm for low-rank matrix completion by proposing a novel reweighted logarithmic norm, solving it with ADMM, and demonstrating improved image inpainting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for better approximation of low-rank matrices in LRMC applications due to suboptimal solutions when using the nuclear norm as a surrogate for rank minimization.

Method: The authors propose a reweighted logarithmic norm as a nonconvex surrogate for the rank function and utilize the ADMM optimization method to efficiently solve the problem.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art LRMC approaches in image inpainting, both visually and in quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: A more effective surrogate for rank minimization is presented and validated through superior experimental results in image inpainting tasks.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) has demonstrated remarkable success in a wide range of applications. To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values. In this letter, we propose a novel reweighted logarithmic norm as a more effective nonconvex surrogate, which provides a closer approximation than many existing alternatives. We efficiently solve the resulting optimization problem by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image inpainting demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art LRMC approaches, both in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 6DoF object pose tracking method using event cameras, leveraging optical flow and a 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction technique for better performance under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses challenges faced by traditional cameras in pose tracking, such as motion blur, sensor noise, occlusion, and variable lighting, proposing the use of bio-inspired event cameras to overcome these issues.

Method: The authors utilize a 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction method to analyze event data, derive optical flow for corner detection, and iteratively optimize object pose by correlating corners and edges in a spatio-temporal framework.

Result: Their approach outperforms similar event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, as shown in experiments with both simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed event-camera-based approach offers a significant improvement in object pose tracking, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Object pose tracking is one of the pivotal technologies in multimedia, attracting ever-growing attention in recent years. Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DexAvatar, a framework for reconstructing detailed hand and body movements from sign language videos, overcoming limitations in 3D pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sign language generation relies on vast amounts of data which often lack accurate 3D pose information and suffer from poor reconstruction quality due to challenges like self-occlusion and motion blur.

Method: DexAvatar is a framework that utilizes learned 3D priors to reconstruct biomechanically accurate hand articulations and body movements from monocular sign language videos.

Result: DexAvatar achieves a 35.11% improvement in body and hand pose estimation on the SGNify motion capture dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: DexAvatar sets a new benchmark for accurate reconstruction of sign language movements, addressing key challenges in 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: The trend in sign language generation is centered around data-driven generative methods that require vast amounts of precise 2D and 3D human pose data to achieve an acceptable generation quality. However, currently, most sign language datasets are video-based and limited to automatically reconstructed 2D human poses (i.e., keypoints) and lack accurate 3D information. Furthermore, existing state-of-the-art for automatic 3D human pose estimation from sign language videos is prone to self-occlusion, noise, and motion blur effects, resulting in poor reconstruction quality. In response to this, we introduce DexAvatar, a novel framework to reconstruct bio-mechanically accurate fine-grained hand articulations and body movements from in-the-wild monocular sign language videos, guided by learned 3D hand and body priors. DexAvatar achieves strong performance in the SGNify motion capture dataset, the only benchmark available for this task, reaching an improvement of 35.11% in the estimation of body and hand poses compared to the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniPath, a novel framework for generating pathology images with controllable semantics, outperforming existing methods and addressing challenges like data scarcity and semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between understanding and generative models in computational pathology, addressing challenges such as a lack of high-quality data, poor semantic control, and terminological discrepancies in pathology diagnostics.

Method: UniPath incorporates Multi-Stream Control using raw-text inputs, semantic tokens derived from a frozen pathology MLLM, and component-level control via prototype banks. It also introduces a curated image-text dataset to bolster data availability.

Result: UniPath outperforms existing methods with better evaluation metrics, such as achieving a 51% improvement in Patho-FID and 98.7% alignment with real-image semantics, along with fine-grained control over image generation.

Conclusion: UniPath represents a significant advancement in semantic-driven pathology image generation by combining diagnostic understanding and improved data resources. The open access to datasets, code, and models fosters further research in the field.

Abstract: In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.

*Hongsong Wang,Heng Fei,Bingxuan Dai,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new self-supervised approach for multimodal skeleton-based action learning, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance efficiency and effectiveness in multimodal human action understanding, addressing the challenges of computational cost from late fusion and poor performance from early fusion.

Method: The method introduces a 'Decomposition and Composition' framework: (1) Decomposition aligns fused multimodal features with unimodal counterparts, and (2) Composition uses unimodal features as guidance for improved multimodal learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD II) show the proposed method balances computational cost and performance effectively.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel solution for efficient and effective multimodal human action understanding, improving representation learning in skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal human action understanding is a significant problem in computer vision, with the central challenge being the effective utilization of the complementarity among diverse modalities while maintaining model efficiency. However, most existing methods rely on simple late fusion to enhance performance, which results in substantial computational overhead. Although early fusion with a shared backbone for all modalities is efficient, it struggles to achieve excellent performance. To address the dilemma of balancing efficiency and effectiveness, we introduce a self-supervised multimodal skeleton-based action representation learning framework, named Decomposition and Composition. The Decomposition strategy meticulously decomposes the fused multimodal features into distinct unimodal features, subsequently aligning them with their respective ground truth unimodal counterparts. On the other hand, the Composition strategy integrates multiple unimodal features, leveraging them as self-supervised guidance to enhance the learning of multimodal representations. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets demonstrate that the proposed method strikes an excellent balance between computational cost and model performance.

Motivation: Existing Visual Place Recognition (VPR) approaches often focus on single-image retrieval, limiting their generalization across varied environments. Multi-view setups offer better recognition potential but remain underexplored.

Method: The paper introduces UniPR-3D, which uses a VGGT backbone for encoding multi-view 3D representations. It includes feature aggregators for integrating 2D and 3D tokens into descriptors and employs both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes for improved generalization.

Result: UniPR-3D outperforms both single- and multi-view baselines, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities across diverse environments.

Conclusion: UniPR-3D effectively combines multi-view inputs and geometry-grounded tokens, proving it's a robust solution for VPR tasks. Its performance sets a new benchmark for multi-view VPR methods.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has been traditionally formulated as a single-image retrieval task. Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR. Our code and models will be made publicly available on Github https://github.com/dtc111111/UniPR-3D.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve table recognition methods, enhancing recognition efficiency and explaining the effectiveness of models in intelligent information retrieval.

Method: The paper introduces a novel multi-task model using non-causal attention for table structure recognition and a parallel inference algorithm for faster cell content recognition.

Result: The proposed model shows significant improvements visually and statistically, evaluated on two large public datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed methods in enhancing table recognition while reducing inference time.

Abstract: The extraction and use of diverse knowledge from numerous documents is a pressing challenge in intelligent information retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2AV-Compass, a benchmark for evaluating text-to-audio-video (T2AV) generation systems using complex prompts and comprehensive evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented evaluation in T2AV systems, which often rely on unimodal metrics or specific benchmarks, failing to evaluate cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism.

Method: The method involves designing T2AV-Compass, a benchmark with 500 prompts built via a taxonomy-driven pipeline, and incorporating a dual-level evaluation framework using objective and subjective metrics.

Result: The evaluation of 11 T2AV systems shows that none achieve human-level realism or cross-modal consistency, especially in audio realism, synchronization, and instruction following.

Conclusion: T2AV-Compass highlights limitations of current T2AV models, serves as a diagnostic tool, and emphasizes the need for systematic advancements.

Abstract: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient and accurate unified recognition of text and formulas in document parsing, overcoming the resource demands of large vision-language models.

Method: Development of UniRec40M dataset (40 million samples), hierarchical supervision training for structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer to separate text and formula representations.

Result: UniRec-0.1B surpasses general-purpose vision-language models and leading expert models in accuracy, with a 2-9× speed improvement, on both private and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper introduces an effective and lightweight model for unified text and formula recognition, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and efficiency. Datasets and code are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Text and formulas constitute the core informational components of many documents. Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FreeInpaint, a tuning-free image inpainting approach that leverages prior-guided optimization and tailored composite guidance to improve prompt alignment and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately aligning user-provided prompts with inpainted image regions while maintaining visual fidelity is a significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to balance these aspects effectively.

Method: FreeInpaint optimizes diffusion latents during inference with a prior-guided noise optimization method and a custom composite guidance objective. These mechanisms refine noise initialization and guide the denoising process for better prompt alignment and visual realism.

Result: Extensive experiments with various models and metrics show that FreeInpaint effectively improves faithfulness to textual prompts while ensuring high visual quality.

Conclusion: FreeInpaint offers a robust and effective solution for text-guided image inpainting without requiring tuning, making significant progress in aligning generated content with user input.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting endeavors to generate new content within specified regions of images using textual prompts from users. The primary challenge is to accurately align the inpainted areas with the user-provided prompts while maintaining a high degree of visual fidelity. While existing inpainting methods have produced visually convincing results by leveraging the pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, they still struggle to uphold both prompt alignment and visual rationality simultaneously. In this work, we introduce FreeInpaint, a plug-and-play tuning-free approach that directly optimizes the diffusion latents on the fly during inference to improve the faithfulness of the generated images. Technically, we introduce a prior-guided noise optimization method that steers model attention towards valid inpainting regions by optimizing the initial noise. Furthermore, we meticulously design a composite guidance objective tailored specifically for the inpainting task. This objective efficiently directs the denoising process, enhancing prompt alignment and visual rationality by optimizing intermediate latents at each step. Through extensive experiments involving various inpainting diffusion models and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed FreeInpaint.

Motivation: To determine whether existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) can function as domain experts by answering marine-related questions that demand specialized knowledge.

Method: Developed MarineEval, a dataset with 2,000 image-based Q&A pairs, ensuring diversity across 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions, with marine domain-specific requirements verified by experts.

Result: Benchmarking 17 VLMs on MarineEval revealed limitations in their ability to effectively answer domain-specific marine questions, highlighting significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: MarineEval emphasizes existing VLMs' limitations and aims to inspire advancements in VLMs for specialized domains, with potential benefits for marine research.

Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve medical segmentation accuracy by addressing issues with alignment in image and text encoders, the inability to preserve fine-grained anatomical features, and domain-specific semantic misalignment.

Method: TGC-Net introduces novel components: (1) Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) for multi-scale structural refinement using CNNs; (2) Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) to incorporate medical knowledge from language models; and (3) Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) to refine cross-modal correspondences.

Result: TGC-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on five datasets in chest X-ray and thoracic CT segmentation, achieving significant Dice score improvements and requiring fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TGC-Net effectively addresses domain-specific limitations in medical imaging, enhancing segmentation accuracy with an efficient, task-specific approach that integrates multimodal medical knowledge.

Abstract: Text-guided medical segmentation enhances segmentation accuracy by utilizing clinical reports as auxiliary information. However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Marine visual understanding is essential for monitoring and protecting marine ecosystems, enabling automatic and scalable biological surveys. However, progress is hindered by limited training data and the lack of a systematic task formulation that aligns domain-specific marine challenges with well-defined computer vision tasks, thereby limiting effective model application. To address this gap, we present ORCA, a multi-modal benchmark for marine research comprising 14,647 images from 478 species, with 42,217 bounding box annotations and 22,321 expert-verified instance captions. The dataset provides fine-grained visual and textual annotations that capture morphology-oriented attributes across diverse marine species. To catalyze methodological advances, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art models on three tasks: object detection (closed-set and open-vocabulary), instance captioning, and visual grounding. Results highlight key challenges, including species diversity, morphological overlap, and specialized domain demands, underscoring the difficulty of marine understanding. ORCA thus establishes a comprehensive benchmark to advance research in marine domain. Project Page: http://orca.hkustvgd.com/.

*Chenghao Xu,Qi Liu,Jiexi Yan,Muli Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel few-shot image generation method that aligns source and target domains using self-rotated proxy feature space for improved generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in few-shot image generation caused by domain distribution discrepancies and the scarcity of target samples, which hinder effective alignment and transfer of knowledge.

Method: The authors propose a method called Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), which uses adaptive rotations in a parameterized Lie Group to transform source and target features into a shared proxy space where alignment is effectively conducted.

Result: EFR significantly improves generative performance in the target domain, as validated by experiments on commonly-used datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning source and target domains within an equivariant proxy feature space using EFR effectively mitigates domain gaps, facilitating better knowledge transfer for few-shot image generation.

Abstract: Few-shot image generation aims to effectively adapt a source generative model to a target domain using very few training images. Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method that can interpolate, inbetween, and extrapolate human motion sequences at any desired frame rate, leveraging the inherently continuous nature of physical motions.

Method: The method involves a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). It uses a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism and a custom parametric activation function powered by Fourier transformations.

Result: The approach shows effective and robust performance in representing complex motion behaviors through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study successfully presents a framework capable of flexibly and accurately representing human motion sequences for various frame-rate applications.

Abstract: Physical motions are inherently continuous, and higher camera frame rates typically contribute to improved smoothness and temporal coherence. For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation. This parametric formulation significantly augments the model's ability to represent complex motion behaviors with high accuracy. Extensive evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraShape 1.0 is a 3D diffusion framework for scalable, high-quality 3D geometry generation, employing a two-stage approach for coarse-to-detailed synthesis and innovative data processing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches often struggle to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries reliably and efficiently. UltraShape 1.0 aims to overcome these limitations through advanced data processing and spatial decoupling techniques.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage pipeline: first, coarse geometry is synthesized, then detailed refinement through voxel-based methods informed by spatial anchors derived from coarse geometry. Additionally, robust data processing is applied to improve publicly available 3D datasets.

Result: UltraShape 1.0 achieves high geometric quality despite limited training resources, outperforming existing methods in data processing precision and 3D generation effectiveness.

Conclusion: UltraShape 1.0 represents an open-source, scalable solution that enhances data processing and geometry generation quality, paving the way for advancements in the field of 3D diffusion models.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce UltraShape 1.0, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage generation pipeline: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry. To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation. All code and trained models will be released to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisRes Bench, a benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), revealing limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and understand the extent to which VLMs perform genuine visual reasoning instead of relying on linguistic biases.

Method: The researchers developed VisRes Bench, a benchmark with three levels to measure different visual reasoning abilities: perceptual completion under perturbations, rule-based inference on single attributes, and compositional reasoning integrating multiple attributes.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs showed near-random performance on tasks with subtle perceptual perturbations, highlighting limited abstraction capabilities beyond pattern recognition.

Conclusion: VisRes Bench serves as a unified framework for advancing research in abstract visual reasoning and overcoming current limitations in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning. Yet, the extent to which these models perform visual reasoning as opposed to relying on linguistic priors remains unclear. To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition. We conclude by discussing how VisRes provides a unified framework for advancing abstract visual reasoning in multimodal research.

*Siqi Zhu,Yixuan Li,Junfu Li,Qi Wu,Zan Wang,Haozhe Ma,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EveryWear is a human motion estimation method using widely available everyday wearables without calibration, achieving practical success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing device-based methods for human motion estimation struggle with wearability issues, costly equipment, and difficult calibration, posing challenges for real-world utility.

Method: EveryWear employs a teacher-student learning framework integrating visual egocentric camera cues with inertial signals from wearables; it uses a new real-world dataset, Ego-Elec, for training without synthetic data.

Result: EveryWear outperforms baseline motion estimation models and eliminates the sim-to-real gap, making it highly practical for full-body motion tracking.

Conclusion: EveryWear offers a lightweight, accessible, and effective solution for motion estimation, leveraging common wearable devices and a novel real-world training dataset.

Abstract: While on-body device-based human motion estimation is crucial for applications such as XR interaction, existing methods often suffer from poor wearability, expensive hardware, and cumbersome calibration, which hinder their adoption in daily life. To address these challenges, we present EveryWear, a lightweight and practical human motion capture approach based entirely on everyday wearables: a smartphone, smartwatch, earbuds, and smart glasses equipped with one forward-facing and two downward-facing cameras, requiring no explicit calibration before use. We introduce Ego-Elec, a 9-hour real-world dataset covering 56 daily activities across 17 diverse indoor and outdoor environments, with ground-truth 3D annotations provided by the motion capture (MoCap), to facilitate robust research and benchmarking in this direction. Our approach employs a multimodal teacher-student framework that integrates visual cues from egocentric cameras with inertial signals from consumer devices. By training directly on real-world data rather than synthetic data, our model effectively eliminates the sim-to-real gap that constrains prior work. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models, validating its effectiveness for practical full-body motion estimation.

*Kelvin Li,Chuyi Shang,Leonid Karlinsky,Rogerio Feris,Trevor Darrell,Roei Herzig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a task-agnostic mechanism that allows Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to self-discover and use visual reasoning tokens for better performance in visual-centric reasoning tasks, overcoming the limitations of traditional supervised visual reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of current LMMs, which are primarily text-centric and struggle with predominantly visual reasoning tasks, especially those requiring intermediate visual abstractions, due to restrictive priors and high annotation costs in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to autonomously discover visual reasoning tokens. These tokens globally attend to and re-encode images in a task-adaptive manner, enabling the model to extract task-relevant visual information without the need for explicit supervision or restrictive priors.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of vision-centric reasoning tasks, including those with hard-to-specify visual abstractions, and generalizes effectively to multi-task instruction tuning.

Conclusion: This approach enhances the visual reasoning capabilities of LMMs, making them more adaptable and effective across diverse vision-centric tasks, without relying on costly annotations or task-specific supervision.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress, they remain largely text-centric, relying on language as their core reasoning modality. As a result, they are limited in their ability to handle reasoning tasks that are predominantly visual. Recent approaches have sought to address this by supervising intermediate visual steps with helper images, depth maps, or image crops. However, these strategies impose restrictive priors on what "useful" visual abstractions look like, add heavy annotation costs, and struggle to generalize across tasks. To address this critical limitation, we propose a task-agnostic mechanism that trains LMMs to discover and use visual reasoning tokens without explicit supervision. These tokens attend globally and re-encode the image in a task-adaptive way, enabling the model to extract relevant visual information without hand-crafted supervision. Our approach outperforms direct fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse range of vision-centric tasks -- including those where intermediate abstractions are hard to specify -- while also generalizing to multi-task instruction tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image-text retrieval is complex due to vague queries, linguistic variability, and scalability challenges, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: It employs event-centric entity extraction for candidate filtering using BM25 in the first stage, followed by BEiT-3 models in the second stage to refine multimodal semantics and rerank results.

Result: The proposed method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559 on OpenEvents v1 benchmark, significantly surpassing earlier methods.

Conclusion: Combining event-guided filtering with advanced multimodal modeling achieves accurate and efficient image-text retrieval in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Retrieving images from natural language descriptions is a core task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with wide-ranging applications in search engines, media archiving, and digital content management. However, real-world image-text retrieval remains challenging due to vague or context-dependent queries, linguistic variability, and the need for scalable solutions. In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions. The first stage performs efficient candidate filtering using BM25 based on salient entities, while the second stage applies BEiT-3 models to capture deep multimodal semantics and rerank the results. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 benchmark, our method achieves a mean average precision of 0.559, substantially outperforming prior baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining event-guided filtering with long-text vision-language modeling for accurate and efficient retrieval in complex, real-world scenarios.

*Bowen Dang,Lin Wu,Xiaohang Yang,Zheng Yuan,Zhixiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SegMo, a framework for generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions, focusing on fine-grained alignment between text and motion segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-motion generation often lacks detailed alignment between textual descriptions and motion sequences, which hinders precision and semantic accuracy. This paper addresses the need for finer-grained correspondence at the segment level.

Method: The proposed SegMo framework features three main components: (1) Text Segment Extraction for breaking down descriptions into ordered atomic actions, (2) Motion Segment Extraction for segmenting motion sequences, and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment using contrastive learning to align text and motion segments.

Result: Experiments show that SegMo outperforms baseline methods, with a TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. It also demonstrates utility in retrieval tasks like motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

Conclusion: SegMo significantly improves fine-grained text-to-motion alignment, enhancing task performance and enabling better semantic correspondence for various applications such as video games and virtual/augmented reality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions is an important research problem with broad applications in video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.

TL;DR: This paper presents DreaMontage, a framework for creating seamless one-shot videos by addressing arbitrary frame-guided video generation challenges efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current video generation models that fail to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence for one-shot filmmaking due to cost and real-world constraints.

Method: The method involves integrating a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism, curating a high-quality dataset with specialized tuning for expressiveness, and designing a memory-efficient segment-wise inference strategy.

Result: The result demonstrates DreaMontage's ability to generate visually coherent, extended one-shot sequences with high fidelity and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DreaMontage empowers users to create vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences by transforming fragmented visuals into seamless long-duration videos while overcoming technical and cost-related challenges.

Abstract: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework for brain MRI, capable of robust performance under any MRI modality configuration, addressing challenges like incomplete modalities and limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in anomaly detection for brain MRI, such as scarcity of annotated data, absence of complete imaging modalities during clinical workflows, and poor generalization of existing models to unseen modality combinations.

Method: The proposed framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder and a feature distribution alignment mechanism to handle incomplete-modality features. An Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder are introduced to bolster semantic consistency by reconstructing normal patterns while highlighting abnormalities.

Result: The framework was tested on extensive experimental datasets (BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks) and achieved superior results compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. It demonstrated robustness across 7 different modality combinations.

Conclusion: This study introduces a scalable and generalizable Any-Modality AD framework for medical anomaly detection, proving its capability for real-world multimodal MRI data challenges with incomplete modalities.

Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in brain MRI remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated abnormal cases and the frequent absence of key imaging modalities in real clinical workflows. Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018, MU-Glioma-Post, and Pretreat-MetsToBrain-Masks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art industrial and medical AD baselines across 7 modality combinations, achieving superior generalization. This study establishes a scalable paradigm for multimodal medical AD under real-world, imperfect modality conditions. Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuchangw/AnyAD.

*Weiqi Li,Zehao Zhang,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a video synthesis framework enhancing controllability by directly aligning attention maps with external signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for controllability in video synthesis face limitations, such as indirect alignment or adversarial artifacts, leading to inaccurate outcomes.

Method: The authors devised ACD, which leverages attention supervision in video diffusion models. Sparse 3D-aware object layouts and a Layout ControlNet are used as conditioning inputs.

Result: ACD shows improved alignment with conditioning signals, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity in video synthesis, tested across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ACD provides an effective solution for conditional video synthesis, overcoming controllability hurdles seen in previous approaches.

Abstract: Controllability is a fundamental requirement in video synthesis, where accurate alignment with conditioning signals is essential. Existing classifier-free guidance methods typically achieve conditioning indirectly by modeling the joint distribution of data and conditions, which often results in limited controllability over the specified conditions. Classifier-based guidance enforces conditions through an external classifier, but the model may exploit this mechanism to raise the classifier score without genuinely satisfying the intended condition, resulting in adversarial artifacts and limited effective controllability. In this paper, we propose Attention-Conditional Diffusion (ACD), a novel framework for direct conditional control in video diffusion models via attention supervision. By aligning the model's attention maps with external control signals, ACD achieves better controllability. To support this, we introduce a sparse 3D-aware object layout as an efficient conditioning signal, along with a dedicated Layout ControlNet and an automated annotation pipeline for scalable layout integration. Extensive experiments on benchmark video generation datasets demonstrate that ACD delivers superior alignment with conditioning inputs while preserving temporal coherence and visual fidelity, establishing an effective paradigm for conditional video synthesis.

*Snehal Singh Tomar,Alexandros Graikos,Arjun Krishna,Dimitris Samaras,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach to generate image sequences by first creating low-resolution sequences and then refining frames individually, using Diffusion Transformer for correlation capture, achieving more efficient and high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in generative modeling methods, inefficiencies persist in modeling image sequence data, particularly with existing techniques treating sequences as large tensors, leading to bottlenecks in image generation.

Method: The method involves generating a coarse low-resolution sequence using Diffusion Transformer and super-resolving individual frames afterward. It does not require architectural changes but relies on leveraging self-attention mechanisms to model temporal correlations.

Result: The proposed approach achieves improved synthesis quality, better frame coherence, faster inference time, and is more efficient in training data usage compared to the current state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The method addresses inefficiencies in modeling image sequences, generalizes effectively across domains without additional priors, and outperforms existing methods in quality and speed.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods typically treat image sequences as large tensors of sequentially stacked frames. However, is this straightforward representation ideal given the current state-of-the-art (SoTA)? In this work, we address this question in the context of generative models and aim to devise a more effective way of modeling image sequence data. Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage. Furthermore, our straightforward formulation enables our method to generalize effectively across diverse data domains, which typically require additional priors and supervision to model in a generative context. Our method consistently outperforms SoTA in quality and inference speed (at least twice-as-fast) across datasets.

*Shihao Zou,Jingjing Li,Wei Ji,Jincai Huang,Kai Wang,Guo Dan,Weixin Si,Yi Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, SpikeSurgSeg, which enables efficient and real-time surgical scene segmentation using spike-driven video Transformers, achieving competitive accuracy and significantly lower latency compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical systems face challenges in achieving real-time scene segmentation due to the computational intensity and power-hungry nature of deep learning models, creating a need for efficient and real-time solutions in surgical environments.

Method: The authors propose SpikeSurgSeg, a framework leveraging spiking neural networks (SNNs) and a unique surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for spatiotemporal learning. It includes a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head to ensure low-latency and temporal consistency.

Result: SpikeSurgSeg achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art artificial neural network (ANN) models while reducing inference latency by at least 8x and providing over 20x acceleration compared to foundation model baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed SpikeSurgSeg framework demonstrates significant potential for real-time, resource-efficient surgical scene segmentation, addressing the challenges of traditional ANN models in surgical applications.

Abstract: Modern surgical systems increasingly rely on intelligent scene understanding to provide timely situational awareness for enhanced intra-operative safety. Within this pipeline, surgical scene segmentation plays a central role in accurately perceiving operative events. Although recent deep learning models, particularly large-scale foundation models, achieve remarkable segmentation accuracy, their substantial computational demands and power consumption hinder real-time deployment in resource-constrained surgical environments. To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence. However, their performance is still constrained by the scarcity of labeled surgical data and the inherently sparse nature of surgical video representations. To this end, we propose \textit{SpikeSurgSeg}, the first spike-driven video Transformer framework tailored for surgical scene segmentation with real-time potential on non-GPU platforms. To address the limited availability of surgical annotations, we introduce a surgical-scene masked autoencoding pretraining strategy for SNNs that enables robust spatiotemporal representation learning via layer-wise tube masking. Building on this pretrained backbone, we further adopt a lightweight spike-driven segmentation head that produces temporally consistent predictions while preserving the low-latency characteristics of SNNs. Extensive experiments on EndoVis18 and our in-house SurgBleed dataset demonstrate that SpikeSurgSeg achieves mIoU comparable to SOTA ANN-based models while reducing inference latency by at least $8\times$. Notably, it delivers over $20\times$ acceleration relative to most foundation-model baselines, underscoring its potential for time-critical surgical scene segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel signal-processing method to improve table edge detection, enhancing accuracy in low-resolution or noisy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately identifying table segment boundaries in low-quality images where existing methods struggle with noise sensitivity and computational costs.

Method: The method models row and column transitions as one-dimensional signals processed using Gaussian convolution and statistical thresholding to refine edge detection.

Result: Improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark using TableNet with OCR.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of table edge detection, making it suitable for downstream structured tabular analysis.

Abstract: Structured data extraction from tables plays a crucial role in document image analysis for scanned documents and digital archives. Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes major real-world usability barriers for GUI agents, stressing challenges like environmental anomalies, adaptive actions, and memory retention for effective task automation.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents can substantially improve productivity by automating frequently executed long-latency tasks on mobile devices. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are still constrained to limited applications, simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics. To address this, we introduce AndroidLens, a challenging evaluation framework for mobile GUI agents, comprising 571 long-latency tasks in both Chinese and English environments, each requiring an average of more than 26 steps to complete. The framework features: (1) tasks derived from real-world user scenarios across 38 domains, covering complex types such as multi-constraint, multi-goal, and domain-specific tasks; (2) static evaluation that preserves real-world anomalies and allows multiple valid paths to reduce bias; and (3) dynamic evaluation that employs a milestone-based scheme for fine-grained progress measurement via Average Task Progress (ATP). Our evaluation indicates that even the best models reach only a 12.7% task success rate and 50.47% ATP. We also underscore key challenges in real-world environments, including environmental anomalies, adaptive exploration, and long-term memory retention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TICON, a transformer-based model improving tile representation in WSIs, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while requiring fewer WSIs for pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for computational pathology fail to capture crucial context from whole-slide images, and existing tile encoders lack a unified approach to perform well across diverse tasks.

Method: TICON utilizes a single shared transformer encoder with a masked modeling pretraining objective to contextualize embeddings from different tile-level models.

Result: TICON demonstrates significant improvement on tile- and slide-level tasks and benchmarks, outperforming prior state-of-the-art models with fewer training samples.

Conclusion: TICON proves effective in building unifying contextualized representations for pathology applications, reducing the need for large datasets while achieving superior results.

Abstract: The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.

### [126] [Fast SAM2 with Text-Driven Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21333)
*Avilasha Mandal,Chaoning Zhang,Fachrina Dewi Puspitasari,Xudong Wang,Jiaquan Zhang,Caiyan Qin,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a text-guided token pruning framework to enhance the efficiency of SAM2 video segmentation, reducing computational and memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAM2 pipelines have high computational and memory costs due to dense token propagation and quadratic memory attention overhead.

Method: A token ranking mechanism prunes tokens post-visual encoding based on local visual context, textual semantic relevance, and uncertainty cues, retaining high-value tokens before temporal propagation.

Result: Up to 42.50% faster inference and 37.41% lower GPU memory usage compared to unpruned SAM2 while maintaining segmentation fidelity across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Token pruning significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of SAM2 for resource-constrained applications without compromising segmentation performance.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), a vision foundation model has significantly advanced in prompt-driven video object segmentation, yet their practical deployment remains limited by the high computational and memory cost of processing dense visual tokens across time. The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for versatile real-time video models that go beyond narrow tasks like question answering or captioning.

Method: The paper introduces Streamo-Instruct-465K, a new dataset for multi-task training in streaming video understanding, enabling capabilities like narration and action understanding.

Result: Streamo demonstrates strong performance in temporal reasoning and task completion across benchmarks, bridging offline video models and real-time assistants.

Conclusion: Streamo advances intelligent video understanding and interaction in real-time scenarios, showing potential for unified multimodal systems.

Abstract: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

*Li-Zhong Szu-Tu,Ting-Lin Wu,Chia-Jui Chang,He Syu,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes a popularity bias in vision-language models (VLMs) that leads to significantly better performance on famous buildings than ordinary ones, questioning their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the reliance of VLMs on memorization over a generalizable understanding, particularly addressing the discrepancy in accuracies when dealing with famous versus ordinary subjects.

Method: The authors introduce the YearGuessr dataset, which contains 55,546 images of buildings from 157 countries, paired with multi-modal attributes such as construction year, GPS data, and popularity proxy (page views). They frame the task as ordinal regression and propose popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to assess the bias.

Result: A benchmark of over 30 models, including the proposed YearCLIP model, shows that VLMs perform well on popular items but struggle with less recognized subjects. This highlights a critical flaw in their reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The work reveals the limitations of VLMs in generalizing beyond memorized, popular entities, urging the need for enhanced reasoning capabilities in these models.

Abstract: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiStream introduces efficient methods to optimize high-resolution video generation, drastically improving speed and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution video generation faces computational challenges due to the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible.

Method: HiStream uses three compression approaches: spatial compression, temporal compression, and timestep compression, to reduce redundancy in video denoising and expedite the process.

Result: HiStream achieves up to 107.5x faster video denoising compared to baseline models, with significant acceleration while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: The HiStream framework successfully makes high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable through innovative optimization strategies.

Abstract: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

TL;DR: RHAPSODY is a multi-runtime middleware designed for executing heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads efficiently on large-scale HPC platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging AI-HPC workflows impose heterogeneous and conflicting runtime requirements, which current systems struggle to support comprehensively.

Method: RHAPSODY provides uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and policies, enabling the composition and coordination of existing runtimes.

Result: RHAPSODY achieves minimal runtime overhead, near-linear scaling for inference workloads, and efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks.

Conclusion: RHAPSODY effectively addresses the challenges of heterogeneous AI-HPC workflows, enabling their scalable execution on leadership-class HPC systems.

Abstract: Hybrid AI-HPC workflows combine large-scale simulation, training, high-throughput inference, and tightly coupled, agent-driven control within a single execution campaign. These workflows impose heterogeneous and often conflicting requirements on runtime systems, spanning MPI executables, persistent AI services, fine-grained tasks, and low-latency AI-HPC coupling. Existing systems typically address only subsets of these requirements, limiting their ability to support emerging AI-HPC applications at scale. We present RHAPSODY, a multi-runtime middleware that enables concurrent execution of heterogeneous AI-HPC workloads through uniform abstractions for tasks, services, resources, and execution policies. Rather than replacing existing runtimes, RHAPSODY composes and coordinates them, allowing simulation codes, inference services, and agentic workflows to coexist within a single job allocation on leadership-class HPC platforms. We evaluate RHAPSODY with Dragon and vLLM on multiple HPC systems using representative heterogeneous, inference-at-scale, and tightly coupled AI-HPC workflows. Our results show that RHAPSODY introduces minimal runtime overhead, sustains increasing heterogeneity at scale, achieves near-linear scaling for high-throughput inference workloads, and data- and control-efficient coupling between AI and HPC tasks in agentic workflows.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper extends well-structured transition systems to include probabilistic scheduling and defines a class of stochastic systems encompassing models like population protocols and gossip systems. It shows constraints on phase clock implementation and the computational power of these systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize well-structured transition systems by introducing probabilistic elements and investigate their computational capabilities when augmented with ordering or equivalence relations.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework for stochastic well-structured transition systems and analyzed their behavior, performance constraints, and computational capabilities.

Result: Proposed systems are shown to either stop or progress unpredictably after expected polynomial steps; their computational power was characterized, showing augmented systems compute BPP languages while unaugmented compute symmetric languages in BPL.

Conclusion: Stochastic well-structured systems provide a unified framework for studying computations of various probabilistic protocols and reveal their potential and limitations, especially under augmentation.

Abstract: Extending well-structured transition systems to incorporate a probabilistic scheduling rule, we define a new class of stochastic well-structured transition systems that includes population protocols, chemical reaction networks, and many common gossip models; as well as augmentations of these systems by an oracle that exposes a total order on agents as in population protocols in the comparison model or an equivalence relation as in population protocols with unordered data.
  We show that any implementation of a phase clock in these systems either stops or ticks too fast after polynomially many expected steps, and that any terminating computation in these systems finishes or fails in expected polynomial time. This latter property allows an exact characterization of the computational power of many stochastic well-structured transition systems augmented with a total order or equivalence relation on agents, showing that these compute exactly the languages in BPP, while the corresponding unaugmented systems compute just the symmetric languages in BPL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoHet, a system optimizing 3D parallelism for heterogeneous GPU environments, offering significant improvements in training throughput and recovery speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenges of distributed training demands in heterogeneous GPU settings, including efficient resource usage and recovery strategies.

Method: The study develops AutoHet, supporting asymmetric 3D parallelism and leveraging a theoretical optimization model for load balancing and device grouping.

Result: AutoHet achieves up to 1.79× training throughput improvement over Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38× faster recovery compared to spot instance baselines.

Conclusion: AutoHet provides an effective solution for dynamic, distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs, enabling better computational and memory efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and the continuous release of new GPU products have significantly increased the demand for distributed training across heterogeneous GPU environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the challenges involved in implementing 3D parallelism in such environments, addressing critical issues such as the need for symmetric tensor parallelism, efficient gradient synchronization in asymmetric pipeline parallelism, and the trade-offs between memory utilization and computational efficiency. Building upon these insights, we introduce AutoHet, a novel system that automatically identifies the optimal parallelism plan for distributed training on heterogeneous GPUs. AutoHet supports asymmetric 3D parallelism structures and facilitates fine-grained workload distribution. We propose a theoretical model that frames the device grouping and load balancing as an optimization problem to minimize per-iteration training time, thus effectively balancing computing power and memory usage across GPUs with diverse capabilities. To enable elastic training upon spot instance preemption, AutoHet presents an efficient recovery strategy that prioritizes to retrieve training states from local nodes, and only downloads the missing checkpoints from the cloud storage. Our extensive evaluation, conducted on three large-scale models and utilizing combinations of three different GPU types, demonstrates that AutoHet outperforms existing DNN training systems, achieving up to a 1.79$\times$ speedup in training throughput compared with Megatron-LM and Whale, and a 4.38$\times$ speedup of recovery speed compared to a spot instance baseline.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses scheduling on GPU spot instances using predictive modeling for cost efficiency and experimental results show its effectiveness with up to 54.8% utility improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and challenge of fine-tuning large foundation models on volatile GPU spot instances, while achieving deadline-aware, cost-efficient scheduling.

Method: Developed hybrid instance usage combining spot and on-demand resources, with online allocation algorithms that utilize market prediction and policy selection to optimize under varying prediction accuracy.

Result: The predictive scheduling approach demonstrated improved utility by up to 54.8% compared to baseline methods, with adaptability to dynamic spot market conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed online framework effectively leverages predictions and adaptive policy selection to navigate price and availability dynamics, providing a cost-efficient solution for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: As foundation models grow in size, fine-tuning them becomes increasingly expensive. While GPU spot instances offer a low-cost alternative to on-demand resources, their volatile prices and availability make deadline-aware scheduling particularly challenging. We tackle this difficulty by using a mix of spot and on-demand instances. Distinctively, we show the predictability of prices and availability in a spot instance market, the power of prediction in enabling cost-efficient scheduling and its sensitivity to estimation errors. An integer programming problem is formulated to capture the use of mixed instances under both the price and availability dynamics. We propose an online allocation algorithm with prediction based on the committed horizon control approach that leverages a \emph{commitment level} to enforce the partial sequence of decisions. When this prediction becomes inaccurate, we further present a complementary online algorithm without predictions. An online policy selection algorithm is developed that learns the best policy from a pool constructed by varying the parameters of both algorithms. We prove that the prediction-based algorithm achieves tighter performance bounds as prediction error decreases, while the policy selection algorithm possesses a regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Experimental results demonstrate that our online framework can adaptively select the best policy under varying spot market dynamics and prediction quality, consistently outperforming baselines and improving utility by up to 54.8\%.

TL;DR: Mesh-Attention outperforms Ring-Attention in distributed attention for LLMs, achieving lower communication complexity and up to 3.4x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability limitations of Ring-Attention caused by excessive communication traffic, making distributed attention efficient for LLMs.

Method: Proposed a new matrix-based distributed algorithm called Mesh-Attention that uses 2D tiles for computations, improving the communication-computation ratio and scalability.

Result: Mesh-Attention achieves up to 3.4x average speedup and reduces communication volume by up to 85.4% on 256 GPUs. It demonstrates better theoretical and experimental scalability.

Conclusion: Mesh-Attention surpasses current approaches in efficiency and scalability, proving its effectiveness for large-scale LLM deployment.

Abstract: Distributed attention is a fundamental problem for scaling context window for Large Language Models (LLMs). The state-of-the-art method, Ring-Attention, suffers from scalability limitations due to its excessive communication traffic. This paper proposes a new distributed attention algorithm, Mesh-Attention, by rethinking the design space of distributed attention with a new matrix-based model. Our method assigns a two-dimensional tile -- rather than one-dimensional row or column -- of computation blocks to each GPU to achieve higher efficiency through lower communication-computation (CommCom) ratio. The general approach covers Ring-Attention as a special case, and allows the tuning of CommCom ratio with different tile shapes. Importantly, we propose a greedy algorithm that can efficiently search the scheduling space within the tile with restrictions that ensure efficient communication among GPUs. The theoretical analysis shows that Mesh-Attention leads to a much lower communication complexity and exhibits good scalability comparing to other current algorithms.
  Our extensive experiment results show that Mesh-Attention can achieve up to 3.4x speedup (2.9x on average) and reduce the communication volume by up to 85.4% (79.0% on average) on 256 GPUs. Our scalability results further demonstrate that Mesh-Attention sustains superior performance as the system scales, substantially reducing overhead in large-scale deployments. The results convincingly confirm the advantage of Mesh-Attention.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESCHER, a GPU-centric efficient data structure to handle large dynamic hypergraphs effectively and proposes methods for efficient triad counting, showcasing significant speedups over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools and methods lack efficiency in processing large and dynamic hypergraphs, which are vital for representing complex group interactions beyond pairwise relationships.

Method: The authors created ESCHER, a GPU-optimized parallel data structure, and developed a triad-counting framework to minimize computational redundancy using ESCHER's capabilities.

Result: The methodology achieved significant improvements in hypergraph triad counting, with empirical validations demonstrating speedups of up to 473.7× across various categories, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: ESCHER successfully addresses computational challenges in dynamic hypergraph analysis, making it a scalable and efficient solution for analyzing group interactions in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework where agents continuously evolve their strategies using adaptable external latent representations, without modifying language model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scalable and adaptive mechanism for multi-agent strategy evolution without requiring model fine-tuning, allowing for more efficient interaction in dynamic environments.

Method: The framework uses a dual-loop architecture: a behavior loop for reward-based action adaptation, and a language loop for updating latent vectors reflecting semantic embeddings.

Result: Agents achieved stable and interpretable strategic styles over extended interactions, with structured convergence in latent spaces. They also demonstrated adaptability to emotional agents without needing shared rewards.

Conclusion: External latent spaces can effectively enable continual strategy evolution for language agents in a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable manner without altering model parameters.

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.
  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.

Motivation: To understand and address the instability of transformer-based sentiment models during dynamic social media events.

Method: Analyzed data from 12,279 social media posts across three transformer architectures, validated with statistical metrics, and proposed novel drift detection methods.

Result: Discovered sentiment model accuracy drop of up to 23.4% and confidence drop of 13.0%. Introduced four drift metrics outperforming existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The zero-training approach reliably detects drift in sentiment models and is suitable for real-time deployment, improving monitoring during significant media events.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive zero-training temporal drift analysis of transformer-based sentiment models validated on authentic social media data from major real-world events. Through systematic evaluation across three transformer architectures and rigorous statistical validation on 12,279 authentic social media posts, we demonstrate significant model instability with accuracy drops reaching 23.4% during event-driven periods. Our analysis reveals maximum confidence drops of 13.0% (Bootstrap 95% CI: [9.1%, 16.5%]) with strong correlation to actual performance degradation. We introduce four novel drift metrics that outperform embedding-based baselines while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment. Statistical validation across multiple events confirms robust detection capabilities with practical significance exceeding industry monitoring thresholds. This zero-training methodology enables immediate deployment for real-time sentiment monitoring systems and provides new insights into transformer model behavior during dynamic content periods.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Naoya Takagi,Takumi Nakagawa,Yuzi Kanazawa,Akira Sakai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHOTON is a hierarchical autoregressive model improving throughput and efficiency compared to traditional Transformers, particularly for long-context decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from high prefill latency and memory-bound decoding due to token-by-token horizontal scanning, which limits throughput efficiency.

Method: PHOTON uses a hierarchical structure with a bottom-up encoder compressing tokens into contextual states and top-down decoders reconstructing tokens, reducing KV-cache traffic during decoding.

Result: PHOTON demonstrates better throughput-quality trade-off and significantly reduces memory traffic, achieving up to 1000x higher throughput per unit memory.

Conclusion: PHOTON offers a substantial improvement over Transformer-based models for tasks requiring long-context and multi-query processing, enhancing memory efficiency and decoding speed.

Abstract: Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks. This reduces decode-time KV-cache traffic, yielding up to $10^{3}\times$ higher throughput per unit memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of accurately predicting lung cancer treatment outcomes due to issues like sparse, heterogeneous, and contextually overloaded real-world health data, and to overcome the limitations of traditional models and impracticality of large-scale fine-tuning in clinical settings.

Method: The proposed method involves employing LLMs as GKCs to preprocess multimodal data (laboratory, genomic, and medication data) into task-specific, high-quality features. These features integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without requiring extensive fine-tuning.

Result: The method achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803, surpassing expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and end-to-end transformers. An ablation study showed the value of integrating laboratory, genomic, and medication modalities for enhanced prediction performance.

Conclusion: By reframing LLMs as curators of knowledge rather than standalone predictors, the study introduces a scalable and interpretable technique that improves predictive accuracy and integrates smoothly with oncology-focused clinical informatics workflows.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of treatment outcomes in lung cancer remains challenging due to the sparsity, heterogeneity, and contextual overload of real-world electronic health data. Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings. By reframing LLMs as knowledge curation engines rather than black-box predictors, this work demonstrates a scalable, interpretable, and workflow-compatible pathway for advancing AI-driven decision support in oncology.

*Weiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper tackles catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for large language models by introducing a quantitative shallow vs. deep alignment framework to measure alignment depth and proposes practical solutions to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches suffer from shallow task alignment, causing spurious forgetting and vulnerability during continual learning.

Method: The paper introduces quantitative metrics, real-time detection methods, specialized analysis tools for recovery prediction, and adaptive mitigation strategies focused on promoting deep alignment.

Result: The approach demonstrates 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baseline methods across various datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: Promoting deep task alignment effectively mitigates spurious forgetting, enhancing the robustness and stability of large language models in continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a fundamental challenge in continual learning for large language models. Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.
  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.
  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.

### [142] [SHRP: Specialized Head Routing and Pruning for Efficient Encoder Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20635)
*Zeli Su,Ziyin Zhang,Wenzheng Zhang,Zhou Liu,Guixian Xu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHRP framework effectively compresses Transformer encoders by pruning redundant attention heads, significantly improving computational efficiency while largely preserving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale web services extensively use Transformer encoders, but their high inference latency and memory consumption hinder scalability and real-time serving.

Method: SHRP employs structured pruning by identifying redundant attention heads and introducing Expert Attention for modular refinement. It uses dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning for deployment.

Result: SHRP achieves 93% accuracy of the original BERT-base for GLUE benchmark while reducing parameters by 48%, preserving 84% accuracy under extreme compression, and achieving 4.2x throughput gain.

Conclusion: The SHRP framework demonstrates practical utility for real-time, scalable web applications by offering efficient compression and significant reduction in computational cost without major accuracy losses.

Abstract: Transformer encoders are widely deployed in large-scale web services for natural language understanding tasks such as text classification, semantic retrieval, and content ranking. However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.

### [143] [Managing the Stochastic: Foundations of Learning in Neuro-Symbolic Systems for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20660)
*Matthew Thompson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured framework to enhance AI-assisted coding by separating stochastic creativity from deterministic processes, increasing reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stochastic failures in current AI coding agents, which arise from their reliance on LLMs for decision-making, leading to unpredictable behaviors such as unit test gaming and syntax hallucination.

Method: A Dual-State Architecture is proposed, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). Atomic Action Pairs and Guard Functions ensure systematic verification of outputs.

Result: The framework was validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs, achieving up to a 66% improvement in success rates for instruction-following models, with a computational cost increase of 1.2-2.1x.

Conclusion: Architectural constraints emphasizing deterministic workflows can improve reliability in code generation, reducing reliance on sheer parameter scaling.

Abstract: Current approaches to AI coding agents appear to blur the lines between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the agent itself, asking the LLM to make decisions best left to deterministic processes. This leads to systems prone to stochastic failures such as gaming unit tests or hallucinating syntax. Drawing on established software engineering practices that provide deterministic frameworks for managing unpredictable processes, this paper proposes setting the control boundary such that the LLM is treated as a component of the environment environment -- preserving its creative stochasticity -- rather than the decision-making agent.
  A \textbf{Dual-State Architecture} is formalized, separating workflow state (deterministic control flow) from environment state (stochastic generation). \textbf{Atomic Action Pairs} couple generation with verification as indivisible transactions, where \textbf{Guard Functions} act as sensing actions that project probabilistic outputs onto observable workflow state. The framework is validated on three code generation tasks across 13 LLMs (1.3B--15B parameters). For qualified instruction-following models, task success rates improved by up to 66 percentage points at 1.2--2.1$\times$ baseline computational cost. The results suggest that architectural constraints can substitute for parameter scale in achieving reliable code generation.

*Dhananjay Saikumar,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gate-Norm, a method to remove attention sublayers in language models without retraining, achieving faster inference with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of large language models by identifying and removing self-attention sublayers that have minimal contributions to model performance.

Method: Introduce Gate-Norm, a weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers based on query-key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, without requiring additional data or fine-tuning.

Result: Pruning 8 to 16 attention sublayers on a 13B-parameter LLaMA model yields up to 1.30x higher inference throughput while maintaining accuracy within 2% of the original on multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Gate-Norm enables fast and effective data-free pruning of large language models, offering significant efficiency improvements while preserving almost all their performance.

Abstract: Many self-attention sublayers in large language models (LLMs) can be removed with little to no loss. We attribute this to the Attention Suppression Hypothesis: during pre-training, some deep attention layers learn to mute their own contribution, leaving the residual stream and the MLP to carry the representation. We propose Gate-Norm, a one-shot, weight-only criterion that ranks attention sublayers by query--key coupling and removes the least coupled ones, requiring no calibration data, no forward passes, no fine-tuning, and no specialized kernels. On 40-layer, 13B-parameter LLaMA models, Gate-Norm prunes the model in under a second. Pruning $8$--$16$ attention sublayers yields up to $1.30\times$ higher inference throughput while keeping average zero-shot accuracy within $2\%$ of the unpruned baseline across BoolQ, RTE, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy/Challenge, and OpenBookQA. Across these settings, Gate-Norm matches data-driven pruning methods in accuracy while being $\sim 1000\times$ faster to score layers, enabling practical, data-free compression of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FEM-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate scientifically valid computational mechanics models using the finite element method (FEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of rigorous benchmarks for assessing the ability of LLMs to create accurate and scientifically valid physical models, especially in computational mechanics.

Method: The authors created FEM-Bench 2025, a benchmark consisting of computational mechanics tasks aligned with a graduate-level course, designed to test numerical and physical modeling capabilities of LLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art models, like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5, demonstrated varied performance, with the former solving nearly all tasks in function writing but struggling in reliability across attempts. Other models showed a wide range of success rates.

Conclusion: FEM-Bench provides a structured evaluation tool for the scientific modeling capability of LLMs, revealing both strengths and gaps, and sets the stage for tracking AI progress in this domain with increasingly complex tasks in the future.

Abstract: As LLMs advance their reasoning capabilities about the physical world, the absence of rigorous benchmarks for evaluating their ability to generate scientifically valid physical models has become a critical gap. Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation. FEM-Bench establishes a structured foundation for evaluating AI-generated scientific code, and future iterations will incorporate increasingly sophisticated tasks to track progress as models evolve.

*Suriya R S,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Rajat Dandekar,Raj Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines predicting the n-body problem dynamics using Scientific Machine Learning, specifically Neural ODEs (NODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional machine learning models used for trajectory prediction in the n-body problem by incorporating physical laws for better interpretability and efficiency.

Method: The study employs Julia's Scientific ML frameworks, leveraging Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), and evaluates their performance on synthetic noisy data.

Result: The UDE model demonstrates significant data efficiency, requiring only 20% of the training data to achieve accurate forecasting, compared to 90% for the Neural ODE.

Conclusion: Scientific ML, specifically UDEs, provides a more interpretable and efficient approach to modeling the n-body problem compared to traditional black-box machine learning models.

Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability limitations of current quantum hardware while leveraging the advantages of data re-uploading quantum circuits in classical models.

Method: Introduced Q-RUN, a classical model inspired by data re-uploading quantum circuits, to combine Fourier-expressive features of quantum models without using quantum hardware.

Result: Experimental results show Q-RUN outperforms standard layers and state-of-the-art networks by reducing parameters and error significantly, across data modeling and prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Q-RUN demonstrates that principles of quantum machine learning can enhance classical artificial intelligence, serving as a versatile drop-in replacement for improving neural architectures.

Abstract: Data re-uploading quantum circuits (DRQC) are a key approach to implementing quantum neural networks and have been shown to outperform classical neural networks in fitting high-frequency functions. However, their practical application is limited by the scalability of current quantum hardware. In this paper, we introduce the mathematical paradigm of DRQC into classical models by proposing a quantum-inspired data re-uploading network (Q-RUN), which retains the Fourier-expressive advantages of quantum models without any quantum hardware. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-RUN delivers superior performance across both data modeling and predictive modeling tasks. Compared to the fully connected layers and the state-of-the-art neural network layers, Q-RUN reduces model parameters while decreasing error by approximately one to three orders of magnitude on certain tasks. Notably, Q-RUN can serve as a drop-in replacement for standard fully connected layers, improving the performance of a wide range of neural architectures. This work illustrates how principles from quantum machine learning can guide the design of more expressive artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces innovations in subgroup discovery for survival analysis using Cox models, presenting new metrics (EPE, CRS) and algorithms to improve accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address deficiencies in existing quality functions for subgroup discovery in Cox models and enhance the methods for identifying interpretable, accurate subgroups.

Method: Develop two novel metrics, Expected Prediction Entropy (EPE) and Conditional Rank Statistics (CRS), alongside eight algorithms for Cox subgroup discovery validated theoretically and empirically on synthetic, real, and case study data.

Result: The innovations recover ground-truth subgroups, improve model fit over naive methods, and identify meaningful patterns in practical applications, verified through empirical tests and case studies.

Conclusion: The study contributes theoretical and practical tools that enhance subgroup discovery, showing robustness and applicability in survival analysis tasks with broad implications for real-world applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of mask optimization in integrated circuit design due to shrinking dimensions, proposing MaskOpt—a large-scale dataset focused on real IC designs for cell- and context-aware deep learning-based mask optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With IC dimensions shrinking below lithographic wavelengths, traditional optical lithography struggles with diffraction and variability. Existing deep learning approaches lack practical datasets and comprehensive consideration of standard-cell hierarchy and surrounding contexts.

Method: A large-scale benchmark dataset, MaskOpt, is introduced, consisting of real IC designs with standard-cell placement and consideration of neighboring geometries.

Result: MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles, used to evaluate deep learning models. Results reveal key trade-offs in current methods and highlight the significance of context and cell-aware inputs in mask optimization.

Conclusion: MaskOpt successfully provides a practical groundwork for enhancing mask optimization using deep learning with cell- and context-awareness, addressing previous limitations in datasets.

Abstract: As integrated circuit (IC) dimensions shrink below the lithographic wavelength, optical lithography faces growing challenges from diffraction and process variability. Model-based optical proximity correction (OPC) and inverse lithography technique (ILT) remain indispensable but computationally expensive, requiring repeated simulations that limit scalability. Although deep learning has been applied to mask optimization, existing datasets often rely on synthetic layouts, disregard standard-cell hierarchy, and neglect the surrounding contexts around the mask optimization targets, thereby constraining their applicability to practical mask optimization. To advance deep learning for cell- and context-aware mask optimization, we present MaskOpt, a large-scale benchmark dataset constructed from real IC designs at the 45$\mathrm{nm}$ node. MaskOpt includes 104,714 metal-layer tiles and 121,952 via-layer tiles. Each tile is clipped at a standard-cell placement to preserve cell information, exploiting repeated logic gate occurrences. Different context window sizes are supported in MaskOpt to capture the influence of neighboring shapes from optical proximity effects. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for IC mask optimization to build up benchmarks, and the evaluation results expose distinct trade-offs across baseline models. Further context size analysis and input ablation studies confirm the importance of both surrounding geometries and cell-aware inputs in achieving accurate mask generation.

*Zihan Yao,Ruoyu Wu,Tianxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of depth-muP in deep learning, develops Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for infinite-width and infinite-depth ResNets, and proposes depth-aware corrections to improve feature learning stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by understanding the instability and diminishing returns of deep learning models at large depths and widths, along with the need for explanations and solutions for these phenomena.

Method: The paper derives Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) and explains feature learning dynamics under infinite-width and infinite-depth conditions. It also introduces depth-aware learning-rate corrections.

Result: NFD explains scaling-law persistence and feature-learning collapse caused by 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling mechanism. Proposed corrections empirically restore depth-wise stability and hyperparameter transfer.

Conclusion: The findings provide theoretical insights into feature learning at large depths, explaining the failure of depth-muP, and offer solutions for improved model performance in deep ResNets.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the imbalance in text-to-image diffusion models, where certain concept tokens dominate image generation, suppressing others (DvD imbalance).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to improve the reliability and controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly in generating images from multi-concept prompts.

Method: The authors introduce DominanceBench to systematically analyze the DvD imbalance, studying its causes from training data diversity and architectural perspectives, including cross-attention dynamics and attention head mechanisms.

Result: The paper finds that limited instance diversity in training data contributes to inter-concept interference, while dominant tokens saturate cross-attention rapidly, progressively suppressing other tokens.

Conclusion: The research advances understanding of generative collapse in text-to-image models and offers insights into addressing the DvD imbalance for better generation outcomes.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have drawn significant attention for their ability to generate diverse and high-fidelity images. However, when generating from multi-concept prompts, one concept token often dominates the generation, suppressing the others-a phenomenon we term the Dominant-vs-Dominated (DvD) imbalance. To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps. In addition, head ablation studies show that the DvD behavior arises from distributed attention mechanisms across multiple heads. Our findings provide key insights into generative collapse, advancing toward more reliable and controllable text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in training neural networks, proposing FOTON—a forward-only algorithm that matches backpropagation's functionality under certain assumptions and improves depth scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation's computational cost has become a growth constraint for training complex neural networks, prompting the need for efficient alternatives.

Method: The authors developed a forward-only algorithm theoretically equivalent to backpropagation under specific assumptions, later introducing FOTON to relax these assumptions and train orthogonal networks.

Result: FOTON surpasses existing alternatives in scalability, achieving depth-independent training efficiency—including competitive performance for convolutional networks.

Conclusion: This work advances neural network training via FOTON, offering a scalable, forward-only alternative without relying on backward computations for diverse architectures.

Abstract: Backpropagation is still the de facto algorithm used today to
  train neural networks.
  With the exponential growth of recent architectures, the
  computational cost of this algorithm also becomes a burden. The
  recent PEPITA and forward-only frameworks have proposed promising
  alternatives, but they failed to scale up to a handful of hidden
  layers, yet limiting their use.
  In this paper, we first analyze theoretically the main limitations of
  these approaches. It allows us the design of a forward-only
  algorithm, which is equivalent to backpropagation under the linear
  and orthogonal assumptions. By relaxing the linear assumption, we
  then introduce FOTON (Forward-Only Training of Orthogonal Networks)
  that bridges the gap with the backpropagation
  algorithm. Experimental results show that it outperforms PEPITA,
  enabling us to train neural networks of any depth, without the need
  for a backward pass.
  Moreover its performance on convolutional networks clearly opens up avenues for its application to more
  advanced architectures. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/p0lcAi/FOTON .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture to generate realistic clinical records for cardiac rehabilitation analysis, enhancing prediction model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac rehabilitation requires structured, individualized processes and data analysis. However, real-world medical datasets face issues such as scarcity, unsuitability, and missing values.

Method: A Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) architecture is designed to synthesize coherent and realistic clinical records, addressing data limitations and enhancing dataset diversity.

Result: The CVAE-generated synthetic data improves cardiac risk prediction accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture boosts cardiac risk detection models and mitigates the dependency on costly and risky diagnostic procedures like exercise stress testing.

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation constitutes a structured clinical process involving multiple interdependent phases, individualized medical decisions, and the coordinated participation of diverse healthcare professionals. This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis. Nevertheless, studies in this context face significant limitations inherent to real-world medical databases: data are often scarce due to both economic costs and the time required for collection; many existing records are not suitable for specific analytical purposes; and, finally, there is a high prevalence of missing values, as not all patients undergo the same diagnostic tests. To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating coherent and realistic synthetic data, whose use improves the accuracy of the various classifiers employed for cardiac risk detection, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for synthetic data generation.

*Roy Turgeman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates when low-level pre-processing can improve classification accuracy, challenging the data processing inequality's suggestion that such steps are unnecessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand under what circumstances low-level preprocessing tasks like denoising or encoding can enhance classification accuracy, especially given the widespread use of such methods despite the capabilities of deep learning.

Method: The authors perform a theoretical study on binary classification tied to the optimal Bayes classifier and analyze setups with varying training sample sizes, class balance, and noise. They validate their findings empirically using benchmark datasets.

Result: Theoretical proofs show that pre-processing improves classification accuracy with finite training samples. Empirical results confirm these trends, demonstrating the impact of factors like training set size, class balance, and noise level.

Conclusion: Low-level data preprocessing can improve classification accuracy, particularly when the number of training samples is limited. This paper provides theoretical and empirical insights into when and why such enhancements are beneficial.

Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.

*Weilin Zhou,Zonghao Ying,Junjie Mu,Shengwei Tian,Quanchen Zou,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in consistency-based multimodal fake news detection and proposes the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF) to amplify cross-modal discrepancies rather than suppress them, achieving notable performance enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the issue of existing multimodal fake news detection methods misinterpreting critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, which results in over-smoothing and loss of critical evidence of fabrication.

Method: The paper introduces DCCF, which decouples inputs into Fact and Sentiment spaces, employs physics-inspired feature dynamics to polarize representations, and utilizes a conflict-consensus mechanism to standardize discrepancies against the global context for deliberative judgment.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show that DCCF outperforms state-of-the-art models with an average accuracy improvement of 3.52%.

Conclusion: DCCF highlights the importance of leveraging cross-modal inconsistencies for detecting fake news, proving to be more effective than traditional consistency-based methods.

Abstract: Prevalent multimodal fake news detection relies on consistency-based fusion, yet this paradigm fundamentally misinterprets critical cross-modal discrepancies as noise, leading to over-smoothing, which dilutes critical evidence of fabrication. Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\%.

### [156] [Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326)
*Sida Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates noise in large language model (LLM) evaluations and proposes a method to analyze and reduce noise to improve statistical power in LLM comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of separating signal from noise in LLM evaluation to make statistical analyses more effective and reliable.

Method: The study defines three noise types: prediction noise, data noise, and total noise following the law of total variance. It introduces an 'all-pairs paired' method for analysis, leveraging millions of question-level predictions across various settings.

Result: Key findings include that evals have a predictable total noise level, prediction noise typically exceeds data noise, and reducing prediction noise can significantly improve statistical significance.

Conclusion: The findings provide methods for practitioners to assess significance without custom tests and detect smaller effects, enhancing controlled experiments and LLM evaluation insights.

Abstract: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.

*Yuanhao Xi,Xiaohuan Bing,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyDRA, a framework to enhance training efficiency for mobile Vision Language Models (VLMs) by using hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling, achieving better results without increasing trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational demands of training mobile VLMs for text and image modalities are high, making it challenging to apply them efficiently in practical scenarios.

Method: HyDRA framework incorporates hierarchical optimization at the layer level and dynamic adjustment using a lightweight performance model to optimize rank assignment during fine-tuning.

Result: HyDRA shows a 4.7% performance improvement on benchmarks across model sizes compared to baselines, and in some tasks, surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

Conclusion: HyDRA is an effective and parameter-efficient framework for fine-tuning mobile VLMs, offering significant improvements with no extra parameter burden.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the emergence of mobile-oriented VLMs, which offer a wide range of application scenarios. However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates vision-language model-based reward functions under a unified framework and finds that a simple triplet loss exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning generalizable reward functions in embodied intelligence by analyzing the impact of reward-model learning objectives.

Method: The paper isolates and evaluates reward learning objectives by using a unified framework with consistent backbones, training data, and evaluation environments. The models are tested on Meta-World tasks.

Result: The findings reveal that a simple triplet loss surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with improvements attributed more to data and architectures than learning objectives.

Conclusion: A simplified model using triplet loss can outperform complex methods, emphasizing the need to rethink assumptions about architectural and objective complexity in reward function learning.

Abstract: Learning generalizable reward functions is a core challenge in embodied intelligence. Recent work leverages contrastive vision language models (VLMs) to obtain dense, domain-agnostic rewards without human supervision. These methods adapt VLMs into reward models through increasingly complex learning objectives, yet meaningful comparison remains difficult due to differences in training data, architectures, and evaluation settings. In this work, we isolate the impact of the learning objective by evaluating recent VLM-based reward models under a unified framework with identical backbones, finetuning data, and evaluation environments. Using Meta-World tasks, we assess modeling accuracy by measuring consistency with ground truth reward and correlation with expert progress. Remarkably, we show that a simple triplet loss outperforms state-of-the-art methods, suggesting that much of the improvements in recent approaches could be attributed to differences in data and architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand stability and robustness in multimodal autoencoders for optimizing their training, architecture, and applicability.

Method: Theoretical derivation of Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods, introduction of a regularized attention-based fusion method, and empirical validation using experiments.

Result: Empirical tests confirm theoretical findings; the proposed fusion method outperforms existing strategies in consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical foundation for fusion in multimodal autoencoders and offers a solution for enhancing their stability and performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of multimodal autoencoders has gained significant attention due to their potential to handle multimodal complex data types and improve model performance. Understanding the stability and robustness of these models is crucial for optimizing their training, architecture, and real-world applicability. This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding fusion in multimodal autoencoders and contributes a solution for enhancing their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI systems are both safe and efficient is critical, especially when incorporating elements like early exits that complicate robustness verification.

Method: The authors define a tailored robustness property for early exit architectures and propose a sound and complete algorithm with heuristic optimizations and early stopping strategies.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and improved algorithm, showing accelerated robustness verifiability and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Early exit mechanisms not only provide inference speed but also enhance the verifiability of AI systems, helping balance trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and efficiency of AI systems is a central goal of modern research. Formal verification provides guarantees of neural network robustness, while early exits improve inference efficiency by enabling intermediate predictions. Yet verifying networks with early exits introduces new challenges due to their conditional execution paths. In this work, we define a robustness property tailored to early exit architectures and show how off-the-shelf solvers can be used to assess it. We present a baseline algorithm, enhanced with an early stopping strategy and heuristic optimizations that maintain soundness and completeness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks validate our framework's effectiveness and demonstrate the performance gains of the improved algorithm. Alongside the natural inference acceleration provided by early exits, we show that they also enhance verifiability, enabling more queries to be solved in less time compared to standard networks. Together with a robustness analysis, we show how these metrics can help users navigate the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

*Brian Lu,Hongyu Zhao,Shuo Sun,Hao Peng,Rui Ding,Hongyuan Mei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR, applied to LLMs, improves generalization in probabilistic inference tasks, especially when the model has adequate initial reasoning competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore RLVR's impact on generalization in reasoning tasks using probabilistic inference over causal graphical models.

Method: Fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or SFT across model sizes and training query levels, constructing datasets for causal graphs and queries.

Result: RLVR outperformed SFT in generalization under specific model sizes and training conditions, showing accuracy gains on complex queries.

Conclusion: RLVR enhances causal reasoning in LLMs, but only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TS-Arena, a platform aimed at solving evaluation issues in Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) by ensuring rigorous and authentic assessments of their forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists an evaluation crisis in TSFMs due to information leakage and illegitimate transfer of temporal patterns during model testing, leading to invalid benchmarking results.

Method: The authors propose the TS-Arena platform, which enforces a strict global temporal split by pre-registering models on live data streams, ensuring evaluation only occurs on genuinely unknown future data.

Result: The TS-Arena platform successfully prevents historical contamination by establishing a moving temporal frontier, safeguarding model evaluation integrity under realistic settings.

Conclusion: TS-Arena offers a sustainable solution for comparing forecasting models in real-world conditions, initially applied in the energy sector, and provides an open-access prototype for broader use.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer transformative capabilities for forecasting, they simultaneously risk triggering a fundamental evaluation crisis. This crisis is driven by information leakage due to overlapping training and test sets across different models, as well as the illegitimate transfer of global patterns to test data. While the ability to learn shared temporal dynamics represents a primary strength of these models, their evaluation on historical archives often permits the exploitation of observed global shocks, which violates the independence required for valid benchmarking. We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split. This methodology establishes a moving temporal frontier that prevents historical contamination and provides an authentic assessment of model generalization. Initially applied within the energy sector, TS-Arena provides a sustainable infrastructure for comparing foundation models under real-world constraints. A prototype of the platform is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/DAG-UPB/TS-Arena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matrix exponential computation is central in various scientific domains, including generative AI, requiring accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic Taylor-based algorithm with optimized selection for polynomial order and scaling factors to efficiently compute matrix exponentials under error constraints.

Result: Experiments show faster computation and improved numerical stability compared to traditional implementations.

Conclusion: The novel method is an efficient and stable solution for matrix exponential calculations needed in generative modeling workflows.

Abstract: The matrix exponential is a fundamental operator in scientific computing and system simulation, with applications ranging from control theory and quantum mechanics to modern generative machine learning. While Padé approximants combined with scaling and squaring have long served as the standard, recent Taylor-based methods, which utilize polynomial evaluation schemes that surpass the classical Paterson--Stockmeyer technique, offer superior accuracy and reduced computational complexity. This paper presents an optimized Taylor-based algorithm for the matrix exponential, specifically designed for the high-throughput requirements of generative AI flows. We provide a rigorous error analysis and develop a dynamic selection strategy for the Taylor order and scaling factor to minimize computational effort under a prescribed error tolerance. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach provides significant acceleration and maintains high numerical stability compared to existing state-of-the-art implementations. These results establish the proposed method as a highly efficient tool for large-scale generative modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and generalization in machine learning models by using symbolic regression over traditional neural network methods.

Method: The study implements SEGVAE, a deep symbolic regression algorithm, to analyze data and extract equations for modeling properties of 2D materials with defects.

Result: SEGVAE produces results comparable to state-of-the-art graph neural networks, showing similar or identical outcomes in some cases.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression methods like SEGVAE are effective, interpretable, and applicable to natural sciences, and they hold potential for predictive modeling in material science.

Abstract: Machine learning models have become firmly established across all scientific fields. Extracting features from data and making inferences based on them with neural network models often yields high accuracy; however, this approach has several drawbacks. Symbolic regression is a powerful technique for discovering analytical equations that describe data, providing interpretable and generalizable models capable of predicting unseen data. Symbolic regression methods have gained new momentum with the advancement of neural network technologies and offer several advantages, the main one being the interpretability of results. In this work, we examined the application of the deep symbolic regression algorithm SEGVAE to determine the properties of two-dimensional materials with defects. Comparing the results with state-of-the-art graph neural network-based methods shows comparable or, in some cases, even identical outcomes. We also discuss the applicability of this class of methods in natural sciences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GLiBRL, a Bayesian Reinforcement Learning method, improving generalization in reinforcement learning using efficient and accurate transition and reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges in classical Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) methods, which assume known transition and reward models, limiting real-world application.

Method: Developed a novel deep BRL method, GLiBRL, which employs models with learnable basis functions to achieve tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference.

Result: GLiBRL significantly improved performance on MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, achieving up to 2.7x success rate over VariBAD, along with consistent, low-variance performance over other methods.

Conclusion: GLiBRL provides an efficient and robust approach to deep BRL, enhancing generalization and performance across competitive RL benchmarks.

Abstract: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) provides a framework for generalisation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems from its use of Bayesian task parameters in the transition and reward models. However, classical BRL methods assume known forms of transition and reward models, reducing their applicability in real-world problems. As a result, recent deep BRL methods have started to incorporate model learning, though the use of neural networks directly on the joint data and task parameters requires optimising the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). ELBOs are difficult to optimise and may result in indistinctive task parameters, hence compromised BRL policies. To this end, we introduce a novel deep BRL method, Generalised Linear Models in Deep Bayesian RL with Learnable Basis Functions (GLiBRL), that enables efficient and accurate learning of transition and reward models, with fully tractable marginal likelihood and Bayesian inference on task parameters and model noises. On challenging MetaWorld ML10/45 benchmarks, GLiBRL improves the success rate of one of the state-of-the-art deep BRL methods, VariBAD, by up to 2.7x. Comparing against representative or recent deep BRL / Meta-RL methods, such as MAML, RL2, SDVT, TrMRL and ECET, GLiBRL also demonstrates its low-variance and decent performance consistently.

*Miguel Esparza,Vamshi Battal,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a predictive framework for wildfire spread and building vulnerability by combining mechanistic physics and data-driven learning to better model wildfire contagion dynamics in urban settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models fail to capture the complexities and contagion dynamics of wildfires at the wildland urban interface (WUI), necessitating an approach that accounts for both environmental and structural vulnerabilities.

Method: A dual specialist ensemble framework is introduced. It includes an environmental specialist using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for modeling community-wide fire spread and a structural specialist using XGBoost to isolate building-specific resilience. Logistic stacking combines these models for holistic risk prediction.

Result: Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the model shows that environmental factors dominate fire spread at the community level, while specific building features, such as eaves, are critical at the micro level. This method identifies high-risk regions and structural vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The framework offers actionable insights for wildfire mitigation by targeting high-risk clusters for vegetation management and improving structural resilience, providing a proactive, data-driven resilience strategy for at-risk communities.

Abstract: As wildfires increasingly evolve into urban conflagrations, traditional risk models that treat structures as isolated assets fail to capture the non-linear contagion dynamics characteristic of the wildland urban interface (WUI). This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.

TL;DR: FedMPDD is a Federated Learning algorithm that reduces communication costs by encoding gradients with multi-projected directional derivatives and enhances privacy through geometric low-rank projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in bandwidth usage and privacy concerns in Federated Learning systems by optimizing gradient communication and enhancing defense against inversion attacks.

Method: Gradient encoding using directional derivatives along random vectors. Messages are compressed from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$ (with $m \ll d$) and aggregated projections are used to decode server-side gradients efficiently.

Result: FedMPDD achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence rate similar to FedSGD, reduces communication cost, and offers tunable privacy-utility controlled by projections.

Conclusion: FedMPDD combines efficient communication, robust convergence, and inherent privacy enhancements making it a promising algorithm for privacy-conscious Federated Learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces \texttt{FedMPDD} (\textbf{Fed}erated Learning via \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{P}rojected \textbf{D}irectional \textbf{D}erivatives), a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimizes bandwidth utilization and enhances privacy in Federated Learning. The core idea of \texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate our theory and demonstrates our results.

TL;DR: Adversarial threats pose significant challenges to machine learning models. This paper introduces a defense system using adversarial training within mixture-of-experts architecture to tackle such threats effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning, despite its advancements, remains vulnerable to adversarial threats that can disrupt model performance through perturbations, data poisoning, and information theft.

Method: The paper proposes a defense system that employs nine pre-trained experts based on ResNet-18 within a mixture-of-experts framework. Parameters of expert models and gating mechanisms are optimized jointly during end-to-end training.

Result: The proposed defense system achieves superior robustness against adversarial threats compared to state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers with more complex architectures.

Conclusion: Incorporating adversarial training into a mixture-of-experts architecture improves robustness, offering an effective solution to mitigate adversarial threats in machine learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning is a powerful tool enabling full automation of a huge number of tasks without explicit programming. Despite recent progress of machine learning in different domains, these models have shown vulnerabilities when they are exposed to adversarial threats. Adversarial threats aim to hinder the machine learning models from satisfying their objectives. They can create adversarial perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans' eyes but have the ability to cause misclassification during inference. Moreover, they can poison the training data to harm the model's performance or they can query the model to steal its sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a defense system, which devises an adversarial training module within mixture-of-experts architecture to enhance its robustness against adversarial threats. In our proposed defense system, we use nine pre-trained experts with ResNet-18 as their backbone. During end-to-end training, the parameters of expert models and gating mechanism are jointly updated allowing further optimization of the experts. Our proposed defense system outperforms state-of-the-art defense systems and plain classifiers, which use a more complex architecture than our model's backbone.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based models face challenges with their large size and computational cost. BLR compression techniques like Monarch and BLAST mitigate these issues but can encounter memory latency problems during multi-token inference. Custom Triton kernels developed here improve performance and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in computational efficiency and memory limitations for transformer-based models, especially during multi-token inference for better model performance.

Method: Roofline analysis is used to identify performance bottlenecks in BLR methods. Custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations are introduced to improve memory efficiency and speed.

Result: The proposed Triton kernels deliver significant speedups (up to $3.76\times$) and model size compression ($3\times$) compared to PyTorch dense methods on NVIDIA GPUs. They are validated across various models like Llama, GPT2, DiT, and ViT.

Conclusion: Custom kernel optimizations effectively mitigate memory-bound latency issues in BLR methods, enabling better efficiency and compression for transformer models while achieving practical speedups on constrained GPUs.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based foundation models have made them the default choice for many tasks, but their rapidly growing size makes fitting a full model on a single GPU increasingly difficult and their computational cost prohibitive. Block low-rank (BLR) compression techniques address this challenge by learning compact representations of weight matrices. While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST. On memory-constrained NVIDIA GPUs such as Jetson Orin Nano and A40, our kernels deliver up to $3.76\times$ speedups and $3\times$ model size compression over PyTorch dense baselines using CUDA backend and compiler-level optimizations, while supporting various models including Llama-7/1B, GPT2-S, DiT-XL/2, and ViT-B.

TL;DR: This paper provides a formal robustness certification framework against data poisoning and test-time attacks in machine learning, using a dynamical system approach with barrier certificates and model-agnostic efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable defenses against adversarial data poisoning attacks in machine learning since current approaches often lack formal guarantees and rely on restrictive assumptions.

Method: The authors model gradient-based training as a dynamical system and use barrier certificates from control theory to certify a robust radius. They parameterize these certificates as neural networks trained on poisoned data trajectories and derive PAC bounds for generalization.

Result: The framework successfully certifies meaningful perturbation budgets against adversarial attacks on datasets such as MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, without relying on knowledge of attack types or contamination levels.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first unified model-agnostic framework that provides formal robustness guarantees against both training and test-time attacks, contributing to safer deployment of machine learning in critical domains.

Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.

TL;DR: The paper addresses flow delay prediction using heterogeneous GNNs, introduces FlowKANet with efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, and develops symbolic surrogate models for lightweight and transparent deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize and manage modern communication networks by achieving accurate flow delay prediction.

Method: The study begins with heterogeneous GNNs as a neural baseline. It introduces FlowKANet, replacing MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, and integrates this into attention-based message-passing. Finally, symbolic surrogate models are derived through block-wise regression.

Result: FlowKANet achieves a balance between efficiency and predictive accuracy, and symbolic surrogate models allow for transparent, weightless yet effective graph modeling.

Conclusion: KAN layers offer an efficient, accurate solution for flow delay prediction. Symbolic surrogates demonstrate potential for lightweight deployment with transparent behavior.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow delay is essential for optimizing and managing modern communication networks. We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies. The results show that KAN layers provide a favorable trade-off between efficiency and accuracy and that symbolic surrogates emphasize the potential for lightweight deployment and enhanced transparency.

### [173] [DiEC: Diffusion Embedded Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20905)
*Haidong Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiEC proposes a novel clustering approach that incorporates representations from pretrained diffusion models, focusing on a specific layer and timestep for optimized clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the representation trajectory formed by pretrained diffusion models for better clusterable representations, addressing the limitations of fixed embedding approaches.

Method: DiEC selects representations by searching over diffusion U-Net layer and timestep, fixes the middle bottleneck layer, and identifies an optimal timestep. Lightweight residual mapping and regularized self-training objectives are applied to refine clustering.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive clustering performance across multiple standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiEC effectively extracts clusterable representations from pretrained diffusion models, leveraging both hierarchical and temporal features of the model to enhance clustering performance.

Abstract: Deep clustering hinges on learning representations that are inherently clusterable. However, using a single encoder to produce a fixed embedding ignores the representation trajectory formed by a pretrained diffusion model across network hierarchies and noise timesteps, where clusterability varies substantially. We propose DiEC (Diffusion Embedded Clustering), which performs unsupervised clustering by directly reading internal activations from a pretrained diffusion U-Net.
  DiEC formulates representation selection as a two-dimensional search over layer x timestep, and exploits a weak-coupling property to decompose it into two stages. Specifically, we first fix the U-Net bottleneck layer as the Clustering-friendly Middle Layer (CML), and then use Optimal Timestep Search (OTS) to identify the clustering-optimal timestep (t*). During training, we extract bottleneck features at the fixed t* and obtain clustering representations via a lightweight residual mapping. We optimize a DEC-style KL self-training objective, augmented with adaptive graph regularization and entropy regularization to strengthen cluster structures. In parallel, we introduce a denoising-consistency branch at random timesteps to stabilize the representations and preserve generative consistency. Experiments show that DiEC achieves competitive clustering performance on multiple standard benchmarks.

*Bharat Sharman,Elkafi Hassini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents GCO-HPIF, a machine learning framework for predicting and explaining the computational hardness of graph-based combinatorial optimization problems, achieving high accuracy and robust interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to address the challenge of predicting and explaining the computational difficulty of solving combinatorial optimization problems on graphs, enabling better understanding and optimization of algorithmic performance.

Method: The framework operates in two stages: 1) It uses graph features and hardness classifications to train machine-learning models for prediction. 2) It applies association rule mining for interpretability and trains regression models to predict computation times.

Result: The framework effectively predicts instance hardness with high metrics (F1 score of 0.9921 and ROC-AUC of 0.9083), provides interpretable association rules for hardness predictions, and achieves accurate computation time predictions (RMSE of 5.12 and R2 of 0.991).

Conclusion: The GCO-HPIF framework proves to be a highly effective and interpretable tool for both predicting computational hardness and estimating computation time, demonstrating significant potential for advancing the study of combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: This study introduces GCO-HPIF, a general machine-learning-based framework to predict and explain the computational hardness of combinatorial optimization problems that can be represented on graphs. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a dataset is created comprising problem-agnostic graph features and hardness classifications of problem instances. Machine-learning-based classification algorithms are trained to map graph features to hardness categories. In the second stage, the framework explains the predictions using an association rule mining algorithm. Additionally, machine-learning-based regression models are trained to predict algorithmic computation times. The GCO-HPIF framework was applied to a dataset of 3287 maximum clique problem instances compiled from the COLLAB, IMDB, and TWITTER graph datasets using five state-of-the-art algorithms, namely three exact branch-and-bound-based algorithms (Gurobi, CliSAT, and MOMC) and two graph-neural-network-based algorithms (EGN and HGS). The framework demonstrated excellent performance in predicting instance hardness, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.9921, a minority-class F1 score of 0.878, and an ROC-AUC score of 0.9083 using only three graph features. The best association rule found by the FP-Growth algorithm for explaining the hardness predictions had a support of 0.8829 for hard instances and an overall accuracy of 87.64 percent, underscoring the framework's usefulness for both prediction and explanation. Furthermore, the best-performing regression model for predicting computation times achieved a percentage RMSE of 5.12 and an R2 value of 0.991.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses memory overhead challenges in fine-tuning large language models by introducing RevFFN, which employs reversible Transformer blocks to reduce memory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of large language models incurs substantial memory costs due to intermediate activations, presenting practical challenges despite the benefits of adapting to downstream tasks.

Method: RevFFN introduces reversible Transformer blocks to reconstruct layer inputs from outputs during backpropagation, drastically reducing memory usage while preserving MoE architectures' expressiveness.

Result: RevFFN enables efficient full fine-tuning of large language models using a single consumer or server-grade GPU, significantly reducing memory consumption compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: RevFFN offers a memory-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning large language models, overcoming bottlenecks associated with activation storage and facilitating accessibility on standard hardware.

Abstract: Full parameter fine tuning is a key technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but it incurs substantial memory overhead due to the need to cache extensive intermediate activations for backpropagation. This bottleneck makes full fine tuning of contemporary large scale LLMs challenging in practice. Existing distributed training frameworks such as DeepSpeed alleviate this issue using techniques like ZeRO and FSDP, which rely on multi GPU memory or CPU offloading, but often require additional hardware resources and reduce training speed. We introduce RevFFN, a memory efficient fine tuning paradigm for mixture of experts (MoE) LLMs. RevFFN employs carefully designed reversible Transformer blocks that allow reconstruction of layer input activations from outputs during backpropagation, eliminating the need to store most intermediate activations in memory. While preserving the expressive capacity of MoE architectures, this approach significantly reduces peak memory consumption for full parameter fine tuning. As a result, RevFFN enables efficient full fine tuning on a single consumer grade or server grade GPU.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing SaaS subscription pricing by balancing revenue, customer retention, and ethical considerations.

Method: The framework combines seasonal time-series models, tree-based learners, Monte Carlo testing, and constrained optimization, ensuring adherence to business guardrails.

Result: Validated across SaaS portfolios, the method reallocates price changes to segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting sensitive cohorts, outperforming static pricing models.

Abstract: This paper presents a marketing analytics framework that operationalizes subscription pricing as a dynamic, guardrailed decision system, uniting multivariate demand forecasting, segment-level price elasticity, and churn propensity to optimize revenue, margin, and retention. The approach blends seasonal time-series models with tree-based learners, runs Monte Carlo scenario tests to map risk envelopes, and solves a constrained optimization that enforces business guardrails on customer experience, margin floors, and allowable churn. Validated across heterogeneous SaaS portfolios, the method consistently outperforms static tiers and uniform uplifts by reallocating price moves toward segments with higher willingness-to-pay while protecting price-sensitive cohorts. The system is designed for real-time recalibration via modular APIs and includes model explainability for governance and compliance. Managerially, the framework functions as a strategy playbook that clarifies when to shift from flat to dynamic pricing, how to align pricing with CLV and MRR targets, and how to embed ethical guardrails, enabling durable growth without eroding customer trust.

TL;DR: The study explores the relationship between training data size and the prediction accuracy of a graph neural network surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction, providing an open-source multi-fidelity dataset for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance in vehicle design necessitated this study.

Method: The researchers generated a multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset using computational solvers (VLM and RANS), conducted a scaling study for the GNN surrogate model using training datasets of different sizes, and observed performance trends under a fixed budget.

Result: The study found a power-law relationship between data size and model accuracy (exponent -0.6122) and identified optimal sampling density and trade-offs between dataset generation and training budgets.

Conclusion: Scaling laws and dataset recommendations were established, showing efficient data utilization and identifying potential cost-performance trade-offs for larger surrogate models.

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models are increasingly adopted to accelerate vehicle design. However, open-source multi-fidelity datasets and empirical guidelines linking dataset size to model performance remain limited. This study investigates the relationship between training data size and prediction accuracy for a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model for aerodynamic field prediction. We release an open-source, multi-fidelity aerodynamic dataset for double-delta wings, comprising 2448 flow snapshots across 272 geometries evaluated at angles of attack from 11 (degree) to 19 (degree) at Ma=0.3 using both Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers. The geometries are generated using a nested Saltelli sampling scheme to support future dataset expansion and variance-based sensitivity analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct a preliminary empirical scaling study of the MF-VortexNet surrogate by constructing six training datasets with sizes ranging from 40 to 1280 snapshots and training models with 0.1 to 2.4 million parameters under a fixed training budget. We find that the test error decreases with data size with a power-law exponent of -0.6122, indicating efficient data utilization. Based on this scaling law, we estimate that the optimal sampling density is approximately eight samples per dimension in a d-dimensional design space. The results also suggest improved data utilization efficiency for larger surrogate models, implying a potential trade-off between dataset generation cost and model training budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a versatile and independent operator learning framework for solving non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations due to the limitations of traditional approximations like the local-potential approach.

Method: The authors proposed the use of Gaussian process operator learning for constructing functional representations directly in function space. Their method is adaptable to various functional equations and incorporates physical priors through kernel design or prior mean adjustments.

Result: The proposed method outperforms traditional approaches by successfully solving complex renormalization equations with better adaptability and flexibility. It can also handle non-constant fields and analyze configurations like instantons.

Conclusion: The framework displays superior performance compared to conventional techniques, making it suitable for a broader class of functional differential equations and enabling detailed exploration of complex theoretical scenarios.

Abstract: We present an operator learning framework for solving non-perturbative functional renormalization group equations, which are integro-differential equations defined on functionals. Our proposed approach uses Gaussian process operator learning to construct a flexible functional representation formulated directly on function space, making it independent of a particular equation or discretization. Our method is flexible, and can apply to a broad range of functional differential equations while still allowing for the incorporation of physical priors in either the prior mean or the kernel design. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several relevant equations, such as the Wetterich and Wilson--Polchinski equations, showing that it achieves equal or better performance than existing approximations such as the local-potential approximation, while being significantly more flexible. In particular, our method can handle non-constant fields, making it promising for the study of more complex field configurations, such as instantons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in navigating the vast chemical space to design high-affinity and synthetically accessible drug candidates, which traditional methods struggle with.

Method: The authors introduced ReACT-Drug, a Reinforcement Learning framework that leverages ESM-2 protein embeddings to generalize across targets, initializes fragment-based searches with known drug ligands, employs PPO agents, and generates molecules through chemically valid transformations.

Result: ReACT-Drug generates drug candidates with competitive binding affinities, high synthetic accessibility, 100% chemical validity, and novelty under the MOSES benchmark.

Conclusion: The study showcases the potential of combining structural biology, deep learning, and reaction chemistry to advance and automate rational drug design, providing tools and datasets for broader application.

Abstract: De novo drug design is a crucial component of modern drug development, yet navigating the vast chemical space to find synthetically accessible, high-affinity candidates remains a significant challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhances this process by enabling multi-objective optimization and exploration of novel chemical space - capabilities that traditional supervised learning methods lack. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReACT-Drug}, a fully integrated, target-agnostic molecular design framework based on Reinforcement Learning. Unlike models requiring target-specific fine-tuning, ReACT-Drug utilizes a generalist approach by leveraging ESM-2 protein embeddings to identify similar proteins for a given target from a knowledge base such as Protein Data Base (PDB). Thereafter, the known drug ligands corresponding to such proteins are decomposed to initialize a fragment-based search space, biasing the agent towards biologically relevant subspaces. For each such fragment, the pipeline employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent guiding a ChemBERTa-encoded molecule through a dynamic action space of chemically valid, reaction-template-based transformations. This results in the generation of \textit{de novo} drug candidates with competitive binding affinities and high synthetic accessibility, while ensuring 100\% chemical validity and novelty as per MOSES benchmarking. This architecture highlights the potential of integrating structural biology, deep representation learning, and chemical synthesis rules to automate and accelerate rational drug design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems can effectively replace or match human data scientists, particularly in scenarios requiring domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The study designed a prediction task involving a synthetic property insurance dataset where a crucial latent variable is conveyed through image data instead of traditional tabular formats. Performance of agentic AI systems was compared against human experts.

Result: Agentic AI systems relying on generic workflows underperformed compared to human experts who utilized domain-specific knowledge to identify hidden variables.

Conclusion: Current agentic AI systems are limited in their ability to incorporate domain-specific insights, underscoring the need for advancements in AI to address this gap.

Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in transforming complex data into actionable insights across numerous domains. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have significantly automated data science workflows, but a fundamental question persists: Can these agentic AI systems truly match the performance of human data scientists who routinely leverage domain-specific knowledge? We explore this question by designing a prediction task where a crucial latent variable is hidden in relevant image data instead of tabular features. As a result, agentic AI that generates generic codes for modeling tabular data cannot perform well, while human experts could identify the important hidden variable using domain knowledge. We demonstrate this idea with a synthetic dataset for property insurance. Our experiments show that agentic AI that relies on generic analytics workflow falls short of methods that use domain-specific insights. This highlights a key limitation of the current agentic AI for data science and underscores the need for future research to develop agentic AI systems that can better recognize and incorporate domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates memorization vs. generalization in diffusion models, analyzing their representation structures and proposing methods for detection and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to distinguish between memorization and generalization in diffusion models and understand their representation learning process to improve generative models.

Method: The study leverages theoretical analysis using a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder and validates the findings on real-world diffusion models.

Result: Memorization yielded localized 'spiky' representations while generalization produced 'balanced' ones; methods to detect and edit representations are proposed.

Conclusion: Learning effective representations is crucial for advancing generative modeling and avoiding memorization while enabling meaningful output control.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse samples, yet they risk memorizing training data when overfit to the training objective. We analyze the distinctions between memorization and generalization in diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. By investigating a two-layer ReLU denoising autoencoder (DAE), we prove that (i) memorization corresponds to the model storing raw training samples in the learned weights for encoding and decoding, yielding localized "spiky" representations, whereas (ii) generalization arises when the model captures local data statistics, producing "balanced" representations. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical findings on real-world unconditional and text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the same representation structures emerge in deep generative models with significant practical implications. Building on these insights, we propose a representation-based method for detecting memorization and a training-free editing technique that allows precise control via representation steering. Together, our results highlight that learning good representations is central to novel and meaningful generative modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenge of identifying correlated segments effectively in noisy correlation matrices, which are computationally demanding with existing methods.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates better segmentation ability and efficiency compared to previous techniques, producing a binary noise-free matrix that accurately highlights segmentation points.

Conclusion: CoSeNet is a scalable, robust, and generalizable approach, applicable across various domains requiring effective correlation segmentation in noisy data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the optimal identification of correlated segments in noisy correlation matrices. The proposed model is known as CoSeNet (Correlation Seg-mentation Network) and is based on a four-layer algorithmic architecture that includes several processing layers: input, formatting, re-scaling, and segmentation layer. The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric. The output of the model is a binary noise-free matrix representing optimal segmentation as well as its seg-mentation points and can be used in a variety of applications, obtaining compromise solutions between efficiency, memory, and speed of the proposed deployment model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a holistic and context-aware ranking system for LLMs as current fragmented, task-specific metrics fail to accommodate diverse benchmarks and dynamic model performance.

Method: The proposed CSD framework utilizes sequential, multi-round contests with dynamic model pairing based on accumulated win/loss scores, supported by Monte Carlo Simulation for robust scoring and Failure Sensitivity Analysis to profile models' risk tendencies.

Result: The CSD framework demonstrates improved ranking effectiveness by simulating high-stakes testing scenarios, revealing distinctions between robust and specialized models.

Conclusion: CSD represents a significant advancement in LLM evaluation by providing nuanced, competitive, and risk-informed rankings, addressing key limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity ($T_k$), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address prediction challenges in cloud native backend systems operating with dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and multitudes of parallel tasks.

Method: The proposed method uses a shared encoding structure for representing diverse metrics, state fusion mechanisms for multiple time scales, structural propagation modules to model node dependencies, and dynamic adjustment mechanisms for system adaptability.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that the framework outperforms other models across multiple error metrics, proves its effective adaptability, and achieves accurate predictions under varying dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully offers reliable predictive capabilities for dynamic, multi-task, and high-dimensional cloud systems, supporting intelligent backend management.

Abstract: This study proposes a unified forecasting framework for high-dimensional multi-task time series to meet the prediction demands of cloud native backend systems operating under highly dynamic loads, coupled metrics, and parallel tasks. The method builds a shared encoding structure to represent diverse monitoring indicators in a unified manner and employs a state fusion mechanism to capture trend changes and local disturbances across different time scales. A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions. Overall, the unified forecasting framework offers reliable predictive capability for high-dimensional, multi-task, and strongly dynamic environments in cloud native systems and provides essential technical support for intelligent backend management.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how single-layer Transformers work with time-series data from a dynamical systems perspective, identifying their capabilities and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are widely used for time-series modeling but their mechanisms are poorly understood in comparison to classical models.

Method: Analyzing single-layer Transformers via causal self-attention as a linear recurrence, with case studies on linear and nonlinear systems.

Result: For linear systems, the softmax attention's convexity leads to oversmoothing. For nonlinear systems, attention acts as adaptive delay embedding under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights aligning Transformers' empirical performance with classical dynamical system theories and highlights scenarios where they excel or fail.

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STLDM is a diffusion-based model enhancing precipitation nowcasting by addressing accuracy and clarity issues. It surpasses existing methods and improves efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a better precipitation nowcasting model addressing the challenges of blurry predictions in deterministic models and poor accuracy in generative models.

Method: STLDM combines a two-stage process: a deterministic conditioning network for forecasting and a latent diffusion model for enhancement, integrating Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network.

Result: STLDM demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple radar datasets and improves inference efficiency.

Conclusion: STLDM effectively tackles the challenges in precipitation nowcasting by combining deterministic and generative approaches using a novel latent diffusion framework.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is a critical spatio-temporal prediction task for society to prevent severe damage owing to extreme weather events. Despite the advances in this field, the complex and stochastic nature of this task still poses challenges to existing approaches. Specifically, deterministic models tend to produce blurry predictions while generative models often struggle with poor accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective model architecture termed STLDM, a diffusion-based model that learns the latent representation from end to end alongside both the Variational Autoencoder and the conditioning network. STLDM decomposes this task into two stages: a deterministic forecasting stage handled by the conditioning network, and an enhancement stage performed by the latent diffusion model. Experimental results on multiple radar datasets demonstrate that STLDM achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art, while also improving inference efficiency. The code is available in https://github.com/sqfoo/stldm_official.

### [188] [BALLAST: Bandit-Assisted Learning for Latency-Aware Stable Timeouts in Raft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21165)
*Qizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BALLAST enhances Raft's liveness by replacing random election timeouts with adaptive contextual bandits, improving performance in challenging network conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Randomized election timeouts in Raft can be ineffective under long-tail latency and network instabilities, causing prolonged unavailability during recovery.

Method: BALLAST employs linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants) to dynamically select timeout durations, incorporating safe exploration to mitigate risks during instability.

Result: BALLAST significantly reduces recovery and unwritable time under challenging network conditions, outperforming traditional timeout heuristics in WAN setups.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust mechanism for improving Raft's liveness in turbulent environments while maintaining competitiveness in stable conditions.

Abstract: Randomized election timeouts are a simple and effective liveness heuristic for Raft, but they become brittle under long-tail latency, jitter, and partition recovery, where repeated split votes can inflate unavailability. This paper presents BALLAST, a lightweight online adaptation mechanism that replaces static timeout heuristics with contextual bandits. BALLAST selects from a discrete set of timeout "arms" using efficient linear contextual bandits (LinUCB variants), and augments learning with safe exploration to cap risk during unstable periods. We evaluate BALLAST on a reproducible discrete-event simulation with long-tail delay, loss, correlated bursts, node heterogeneity, and partition/recovery turbulence. Across challenging WAN regimes, BALLAST substantially reduces recovery time and unwritable time compared to standard randomized timeouts and common heuristics, while remaining competitive on stable LAN/WAN settings.

Conclusion: Universum learning successfully improves classification performance in EEG signals, with IU-GEPSVM outperforming baseline methods.

Abstract: The paper presents novel Universum-enhanced classifiers: the Universum Generalized Eigenvalue Proximal Support Vector Machine (U-GEPSVM) and the Improved U-GEPSVM (IU-GEPSVM) for EEG signal classification. Using the computational efficiency of generalized eigenvalue decomposition and the generalization benefits of Universum learning, the proposed models address critical challenges in EEG analysis: non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and limited labeled data. U-GEPSVM extends the GEPSVM framework by incorporating Universum constraints through a ratio-based objective function, while IU-GEPSVM enhances stability through a weighted difference-based formulation that provides independent control over class separation and Universum alignment. The models are evaluated on the Bonn University EEG dataset across two binary classification tasks: (O vs S)-healthy (eyes closed) vs seizure, and (Z vs S)-healthy (eyes open) vs seizure. IU-GEPSVM achieves peak accuracies of 85% (O vs S) and 80% (Z vs S), with mean accuracies of 81.29% and 77.57% respectively, outperforming baseline methods.

### [190] [Analytic and Variational Stability of Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208)
*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified analytic framework for studying stability in deep learning systems, introducing the Learning Stability Profile and linking stability to Lyapunov-type energy dissipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of stability in deep learning systems and clarify how architecture and algorithm choices impact robustness and sensitivity.

Method: A unified analytic and variational framework is developed, incorporating classical derivatives, Clarke generalized derivatives, and Lyapunov functionals for both smooth and non-smooth dynamics.

Result: The framework ties stability signatures to Lyapunov-type energy dissipation, produces explicit stability exponents, and unifies classical spectral results, discrete CFL-type conditions, and stability laws.

Conclusion: The study introduces a unified dynamical model for stability studies in different architectures and optimization methods, and lays the groundwork for geometric and continuous-time extensions.

Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.

*Andres M Bran,Tong Xie,Shai Pranesh,Jeffrey Meng,Xuan Vu Nguyen,Jeremy Goumaz,David Ming Segura,Ruizhi Xu,Dongzhan Zhou,Wenjie Zhang,Bram Hoex,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to improve chemical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) and mid-stage training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the limitations of LLMs in performing chemical reasoning tasks, focusing on the need for 'latent solvability,' meaning the base model must already assign some probability to correct answers for RL to succeed.

Method: The authors introduce mid-stage scientific training (MiST), a combination of data-mixing with domain-specific pre-processing, continued pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning to improve latent solvability in LLMs.

Result: The proposed techniques improved latent-solvability scores for 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x. RL enhanced top-1 accuracy significantly, such as from 10.9% to 63.9% in organic reaction naming and from 40.6% to 67.4% in inorganic material generation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes robust prerequisites for enabling RL-based chemical reasoning, emphasizing the role of mid-stage training in unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.

*Xinjie Xu,Shuyu Cheng,Dongwei Xu,Qi Xuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a momentum-based algorithm (ARS-OPT) and its variant (PARS-OPT) to improve adversarial attack efficiency in hard-label black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high query complexity of hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, particularly for minimizing $l_2$-norm perturbations.

Method: Proposed ARS-OPT based on Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient for more accurate and faster directional updates, with PARS-OPT integrating surrogate-model priors to further optimize gradient estimation.

Result: ARS-OPT and PARS-OPT outperform 13 state-of-the-art methods in query efficiency on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve directional update accuracy and efficiency, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: In hard-label black-box adversarial attacks, where only the top-1 predicted label is accessible, the prohibitive query complexity poses a major obstacle to practical deployment. In this paper, we focus on optimizing a representative class of attacks that search for the optimal ray direction yielding the minimum $\ell_2$-norm perturbation required to move a benign image into the adversarial region. Inspired by Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG), we propose a momentum-based algorithm, ARS-OPT, which proactively estimates the gradient with respect to a future ray direction inferred from accumulated momentum. We provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, showing that ARS-OPT enables more accurate directional updates and achieves faster, more stable optimization. To further accelerate convergence, we incorporate surrogate-model priors into ARS-OPT's gradient estimation, resulting in PARS-OPT with enhanced performance. The superiority of our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method surpasses 13 state-of-the-art approaches in query efficiency.

### [193] [Model Merging via Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21288)
*Seyed Arshan Dalili,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents SAMerging, a novel method leveraging theoretical insights and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to improve model merging across vision and NLP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding and principled objectives in model merging, which often results in unreliable performance and sensitivity to scaling factors.

Method: The authors propose a flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound for merged models, identify cross-task heterogeneity, and frame merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation with minimal data. They implement this using SAM to achieve flat minima.

Result: SAMerging achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and NLP benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in model merging.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical framework and methodology to improve the reliability and performance of model merging, offering an effective alternative to joint multi-task learning.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a "cross-task heterogeneity" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk. Guided by the flatness-aware bound derived, (iii) we operationalize this objective via SAMerging, a method that employs Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to find flat minima. Empirically, SAMerging establishes a new state of the art across vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving remarkable performance. The code is available at https://github.com/arshandalili/SAMerging.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computational framework combining transcriptomics and drug discovery, yielding patient-specific, scalable oncology solutions for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of effective personalized therapies for AML, which remains challenging due to molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates.

Method: The framework utilized RNA sequencing data analyzed through WGCNA to identify biomarkers. AlphaFold3 modeled their structures, and druggable hotspots were mapped using the DOGSiteScorer engine. A novel computational algorithm assembled ligands optimized for these hotspots.

Result: The generative model created unique, drug-like molecules validated by QED scores, ADMET profiling, and molecular docking. Ligand L1 showed promising binding affinity against a biomarker.

Conclusion: This approach successfully creates patient-specific drug leads by integrating systems biology with molecular assembly, presenting a scalable precision oncology solution for AML.

Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge due to its extreme molecular heterogeneity and high relapse rates. While precision medicine has introduced mutation-specific therapies, many patients still lack effective, personalized options. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end computational framework that bridges the gap between patient-specific transcriptomics and de novo drug discovery. By analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data from the TCGA-LAML cohort, the study utilized Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to prioritize 20 high-value biomarkers, including metabolic transporters like HK3 and immune-modulatory receptors such as SIGLEC9. The physical structures of these targets were modeled using AlphaFold3, and druggable hotspots were quantitatively mapped via the DOGSiteScorer engine. Then developed a novel, reaction-first evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm as well as multi-objective optimization programming that assembles novel ligands from fragment libraries, guided by spatial alignment to these identified hotspots. The generative model produced structurally unique chemical entities with a strong bias toward drug-like space, as evidenced by QED scores peaking between 0.5 and 0.7. Validation through ADMET profiling and SwissDock molecular docking identified high-confidence candidates, such as Ligand L1, which achieved a binding free energy of -6.571 kcal/mol against the A08A96 biomarker. These results demonstrate that integrating systems biology with metaheuristic molecular assembly can produce pharmacologically viable, patient tailored leads, offering a scalable blueprint for precision oncology in AML and beyond

*Lilian Welschinger,Yilin Liu,Zican Wang,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a mesh-free method to solve surface PDEs directly on neural representations, bypassing mesh extraction and enabling end-to-end workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods require polygonal meshes or per-instance training to solve PDEs, causing a mismatch with neural 3D asset formats and hindering integration in modern pipelines.

Method: The authors designed a local update operator conditioned on neural shape attributes, compatible with neural surface representations, trained once on a single shape and generalized across variations.

Result: The proposed method slightly outperformed CPM, had performance close to FEM, and enabled end-to-end solving of surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

Conclusion: The technique simplifies workflows, is efficient, preserves differentiability, and enables solving PDEs directly in the neural domain across diverse shape and topology variations.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations. Code will be released on acceptance.

### [196] [Anytime Metaheuristic Framework for Global Route Optimization in Expected-Time Mobile Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20711)
*Jan Mikula,Miroslav Kulich*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the expected-time mobile search in continuous environments and proposes a new solution framework ‘Milaps’ to optimize sensing routes efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile search in continuous spaces faces challenges due to the intractability of objective evaluation arising from motion and visibility constraints.

Method: The study introduces Milaps, which integrates auxiliary objectives and adapts metaheuristics for efficient global route optimization.

Result: Milaps achieves better solution quality versus runtime trade-offs compared to existing methods, supported by evaluations on a large-scale dataset.

Conclusion: Milaps provides an efficient framework for mobile search tasks, demonstrating flexibility in diverse scenarios and improving performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Expected-time mobile search (ETS) is a fundamental robotics task where a mobile sensor navigates an environment to minimize the expected time required to locate a hidden object. Global route optimization for ETS in static 2D continuous environments remains largely underexplored due to the intractability of objective evaluation, stemming from the continuous nature of the environment and the interplay of motion and visibility constraints. Prior work has addressed this through partial discretization, leading to discrete-sensing formulations tackled via utility-greedy heuristics. Others have taken an indirect approach by heuristically approximating the objective using minimum latency problems on fixed graphs, enabling global route optimization via efficient metaheuristics. This paper builds on and significantly extends the latter by introducing Milaps (Minimum latency problems), a model-based solution framework for ETS. Milaps integrates novel auxiliary objectives and adapts a recent anytime metaheuristic for the traveling deliveryman problem, chosen for its strong performance under tight runtime constraints. Evaluations on a novel large-scale dataset demonstrate superior trade-offs between solution quality and runtime compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The best-performing strategy rapidly generates a preliminary solution, assigns static weights to sensing configurations, and optimizes global costs metaheuristically. Additionally, a qualitative study highlights the framework's flexibility across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vision-based system for autonomous interception of dynamic targets, validated with UAVs, ground rovers, and spacecraft, relying only on monocular cameras and local frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust, general-purpose method capable of handling dynamic target interception across diverse robotic platforms with limited observability and without relying on global localization.

Method: The system integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for pose estimation, (2) motion prediction for target trajectories, and (3) a receding-horizon planner for real-time path planning under constraints.

Result: The system shows reliable performance in experiments with dynamic targets under limited observation, achieving high success rates, low errors, and real-time execution on embedded processors.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable, computationally efficient, and robust under challenging conditions, making it suitable for diverse robotic platforms and dynamic interception tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a general purpose framework for autonomous, vision-based interception of dynamic, non-cooperative targets, validated across three distinct mobility platforms: an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a four-wheeled ground rover, and an air-thruster spacecraft testbed. The approach relies solely on a monocular camera with fiducials for target tracking and operates entirely in the local observer frame without the need for global information. The core contribution of this work is a streamlined and general approach to autonomous interception that can be adapted across robots with varying dynamics, as well as our comprehensive study of the robot interception problem across heterogenous mobility systems under limited observability and no global localization. Our method integrates (1) an Extended Kalman Filter for relative pose estimation amid intermittent measurements, (2) a history-conditioned motion predictor for dynamic target trajectory propagation, and (3) a receding-horizon planner solving a constrained convex program in real time to ensure time-efficient and kinematically feasible interception paths. Our operating regime assumes that observability is restricted by partial fields of view, sensor dropouts, and target occlusions. Experiments are performed in these conditions and include autonomous UAV landing on dynamic targets, rover rendezvous and leader-follower tasks, and spacecraft proximity operations. Results from simulated and physical experiments demonstrate robust performance with low interception errors (both during station-keeping and upon scenario completion), high success rates under deterministic and stochastic target motion profiles, and real-time execution on embedded processors such as the Jetson Orin, VOXL2, and Raspberry Pi 5. These results highlight the framework's generalizability, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.

TL;DR: The paper explores a non-model-based system safety approach for feedback systems, using critical slowing down as a resilience indicator, applicable to engineered devices like drones and beyond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional system stability methods require accurate models, which fail under damage or divergence; the paper aims to provide a more robust solution using dynamical resilience indicators.

Method: The study monitors instability in systems by leveraging dynamical resilience indicators (e.g., critical slowing down) instead of relying on system models.

Result: This approach was validated on drones, showing its effectiveness in providing real-time early warnings of instability in dynamic systems.

Conclusion: The findings introduce a model-free resilience monitoring system, applicable across various controlled systems, including reactors, aircraft, and autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Maintaining stability in feedback systems, from aircraft and autonomous robots to biological and physiological systems, relies on monitoring their behavior and continuously adjusting their inputs. Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or "tinkering". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars.

*Kanata Suzuki,Shota Shimizu,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) in understanding low-level robot motion through a video captioning task including trajectory data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if VLMs trained on offline data (images and language) can comprehend robot motion, enhancing robotics applications such as imitation learning.

Method: The method integrates robot motion data (joint and end-effector states) with VLMs for automatic task captioning and subtask segmentation using embedding similarity.

Result: Simulator experiments validated the method's effectiveness in generating accurate captions and segmenting subtasks for robot tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach links language and motion data, improving VLM performance and advancing imitation learning efficiency in robotics.

Abstract: From the perspective of future developments in robotics, it is crucial to verify whether foundation models trained exclusively on offline data, such as images and language, can understand the robot motion. In particular, since Vision Language Models (VLMs) do not include low-level motion information from robots in their training datasets, video understanding including trajectory information remains a significant challenge. In this study, we assess two capabilities of VLMs through a video captioning task with low-level robot motion information: (1) automatic captioning of robot tasks and (2) segmentation of a series of tasks. Both capabilities are expected to enhance the efficiency of robot imitation learning by linking language and motion and serve as a measure of the foundation model's performance. The proposed method generates multiple "scene" captions using image captions and trajectory data from robot tasks. The full task caption is then generated by summarizing these individual captions. Additionally, the method performs subtask segmentation by comparing the similarity between text embeddings of image captions. In both captioning tasks, the proposed method aims to improve performance by providing the robot's motion data - joint and end-effector states - as input to the VLM. Simulator experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the developed tactile sensor can maintain high resolution, scalability, and robustness, proving valuable for applications in soft robotics and precise human-machine interactions.

Abstract: Stretchable sensors indicate promising prospects for soft robotics, medical devices, and human-machine interactions due to the high compliance of soft materials. Discrete sensing strategies, including sensor arrays and distributed sensors, are broadly involved in tactile sensors across versatile applications. However, it remains a challenge to achieve high spatial resolution with self-decoupled capacity and insensitivity to other off-axis stimuli for stretchable tactile sensors. Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting. We further demonstrate the sensors' performance by integrating them into a planar parallel mechanism for precise trajectory tracking (rotational resolution: 0.02°) in real time.

*Baoshan Song,Matthew Giamou,Penggao Yan,Chunxi Xia,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a certifiable method for obtaining globally optimal solutions in aligning local systems with GNSS, outperforming traditional methods particularly in GNSS-degraded environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of existing alignment methods which struggle with local minima, satellite availability, and guaranteeing solution optimality in GNSS-degraded environments.

Method: The method relaxes the problem of frame alignment (formulated as a QCQP) into a concave Lagrangian dual problem, performs tightness and observability analysis, and ensures certifiability of the solution.

Result: The proposed technique achieves certifiably optimal results with minimal satellite data (e.g., only 2 satellites and 2D vehicle motion), outperforming existing methods in terms of avoiding local minima in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: This work successfully bridges gaps in GNSS-based navigation methods by introducing a certifiable, open-source solution that ensures robust and optimal alignment in degraded satellite environments.

Abstract: Estimating the absolute orientation of a local system relative to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference often suffers from local minima and high dependency on satellite availability. Existing methods for this alignment task rely on abundant satellites unavailable in GNSS-degraded environments, or use local optimization methods which cannot guarantee the optimality of a solution. This work introduces a globally optimal solver that transforms raw pseudo-range or Doppler measurements into a convexly relaxed problem. The proposed method is certifiable, meaning it can numerically verify the correctness of the result, filling a gap where existing local optimizers fail. We first formulate the original frame alignment problem as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem and relax the QCQP problem to a concave Lagrangian dual problem that provides a lower cost bound for the original problem. Then we perform relaxation tightness and observability analysis to derive criteria for certifiable optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation and real world experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experiments show that our method provides certifiably optimal solutions even with only 2 satellites with Doppler measurements and 2D vehicle motion, while the traditional velocity-based VOBA method and the advanced GVINS alignment technique may fail or converge to local optima without notice. To support the development of GNSS-based navigation techniques in robotics, all code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Baoshan-Song/Certifiable-Doppler-alignment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ETP-R1, a framework improving graph-based Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) by scaling data and using Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to close the performance gap between graph-based VLN-CE methods and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms.

Method: The framework, ETP-R1, constructs a high-quality large-scale pretraining dataset using Gemini API, unifies data from R2R and RxR tasks, and employs a three-stage training paradigm involving closed-loop Reinforcement Fine-Tuning using the GRPO algorithm.

Result: ETP-R1 achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major metrics on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Graph-based VLN-CE models can be significantly improved by scaling data and employing advanced training strategies, bridging the gap with LVLM-based methods and setting new performance benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires an embodied agent to navigate towards target in continuous environments, following natural language instructions. While current graph-based methods offer an efficient, structured approach by abstracting the environment into a topological map and simplifying the action space to waypoint selection, they lag behind methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in leveraging large-scale data and advanced training paradigms. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by introducing ETP-R1, a framework that applies the paradigm of scaling up data and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to a graph-based VLN-CE model. To build a strong foundation, we first construct a high-quality, large-scale pretraining dataset using the Gemini API. This dataset consists of diverse, low-hallucination instructions for topological trajectories, providing rich supervision for our graph-based policy to map language to topological paths. This foundation is further strengthened by unifying data from both R2R and RxR tasks for joint pretraining. Building on this, we introduce a three-stage training paradigm, which culminates in the first application of closed-loop, online RFT to a graph-based VLN-CE model, powered by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is highly effective, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across all major metrics on both the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks.

*Jiangen He,Wanqi Zhang,Jessica Barfield*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores how societal biases influence human selections of robotic agents based on race, occupational contexts, and stereotypes, finding evidence of bias transfers from human-human to human-robot interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if societal biases and stereotypes influence the perception and selection of robotic agents in professional contexts.

Method: Conducted two experiments with 1,038 participants across four professional domains (construction, healthcare, education, athletics), examining preferences for artificial agents with varying features like skin tone and anthropomorphism.

Result: Participants exhibited bias in robotic agent selection, favoring lighter-skinned robots in healthcare and education, while darker-skinned robots were more accepted in construction and athletics. Exposure to human professionals of specific races influenced robotic selection biases.

Conclusion: Societal occupational and racial biases are mirrored in human-robot interactions, potentially perpetuating existing social inequalities in robotic deployments.

Abstract: As artificial agents increasingly integrate into professional environments, fundamental questions have emerged about how societal biases influence human-robot selection decisions. We conducted two comprehensive experiments (N = 1,038) examining how occupational contexts and stereotype activation shape robotic agent choices across construction, healthcare, educational, and athletic domains. Participants made selections from artificial agents that varied systematically in skin tone and anthropomorphic characteristics. Our study revealed distinct context-dependent patterns. Healthcare and educational scenarios demonstrated strong favoritism toward lighter-skinned artificial agents, while construction and athletic contexts showed greater acceptance of darker-toned alternatives. Participant race was associated with systematic differences in selection patterns across professional domains. The second experiment demonstrated that exposure to human professionals from specific racial backgrounds systematically shifted later robotic agent preferences in stereotype-consistent directions. These findings show that occupational biases and color-based discrimination transfer directly from human-human to human-robot evaluation contexts. The results highlight mechanisms through which robotic deployment may unintentionally perpetuate existing social inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Force signals alone in soft-tissue environments are unreliable for detecting subtle subsurface features, necessitating the development of better sensing techniques for robotic palpation.

Method: A compact sensor combining high-resolution vision-based tactile imaging and a 6-axis force-torque sensor was used to analyze subsurface tendon geometries and manage controlled interaction.

Result: The tactile imaging provided clear subsurface structure insights, while force tracking ensured safe and stable interactions, offering complementary benefits for robust feature detection.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile and force sensing enhances robotic palpation by revealing structural detail and maintaining interaction safety, potentially improving physiotherapy applications.

Abstract: Robotic palpation relies on force sensing, but force signals in soft-tissue environments are variable and cannot reliably reveal subtle subsurface features. We present a compact multimodal sensor that integrates high-resolution vision-based tactile imaging with a 6-axis force-torque sensor. In experiments on silicone phantoms with diverse subsurface tendon geometries, force signals alone frequently produce ambiguous responses, while tactile images reveal clear structural differences in presence, diameter, depth, crossings, and multiplicity. Yet accurate force tracking remains essential for maintaining safe, consistent contact during physiotherapeutic interaction. Preliminary results show that combining tactile and force modalities enables robust subsurface feature detection and controlled robotic palpation.

*Cheng-Yu Kuo,Hirofumi Shin,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for robotic grasping force control, inspired by human touch, to reduce slippage during object interaction—using a physics-informed energy model and tactile data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers sought to address the challenge of reducing slippage during robotic manipulation, especially under dynamic conditions, unknown object properties, and unreliable external sensing — areas where humans excel via tactile regulation.

Method: The paper introduces a physics-informed energy abstraction modeling objects as energy containers. A model-based learning approach utilizes tactile data to measure energy dynamics, optimizing grasping force in real-time without external sensing or prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments showed the method could learn force control in minutes, minimize slippage, and extend grasp durations across various scenarios in both simulation and hardware setups.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enables efficient, adaptive, tactile-driven force control for robotic hands in diverse conditions, advancing autonomous robotic manipulation technologies.

Abstract: Regulating grasping force to reduce slippage during dynamic object interaction remains a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, especially when objects are manipulated by multiple rolling contacts, have unknown properties (such as mass or surface conditions), and when external sensing is unreliable. In contrast, humans can quickly regulate grasping force by touch, even without visual cues. Inspired by this ability, we aim to enable robotic hands to rapidly explore objects and learn tactile-driven grasping force control under motion and limited sensing. We propose a physics-informed energy abstraction that models the object as a virtual energy container. The inconsistency between the fingers' applied power and the object's retained energy provides a physically grounded signal for inferring slip-aware stability. Building on this abstraction, we employ model-based learning and planning to efficiently model energy dynamics from tactile sensing and perform real-time grasping force optimization. Experiments in both simulation and hardware demonstrate that our method can learn grasping force control from scratch within minutes, effectively reduce slippage, and extend grasp duration across diverse motion-object pairs, all without relying on external sensing or prior object knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited semantic grounding and weak alignment in existing language-conditioned grasping methods, enabling robots to better understand and execute tasks in diverse environments.

Method: LGGD employs a hierarchical cross-modal fusion process using CLIP-based embeddings and introduces a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head to enhance alignment between visual grasping and linguistic instructions. It further includes a refinement module for robustness.

Result: LGGD outperforms existing methods on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets, showcasing strong generalization to new objects and diverse language queries. It is practically effective when tested on real robots.

Conclusion: LGGD advances robotic language-guided grasping by enabling precise and robust task-specific actions. The proposed approach bridges the gap between linguistic guidance and physical manipulation for a variety of environments.

Abstract: Grasping is one of the most fundamental challenging capabilities in robotic manipulation, especially in unstructured, cluttered, and semantically diverse environments. Recent researches have increasingly explored language-guided manipulation, where robots not only perceive the scene but also interpret task-relevant natural language instructions. However, existing language-conditioned grasping methods typically rely on shallow fusion strategies, leading to limited semantic grounding and weak alignment between linguistic intent and visual grasp reasoning.In this work, we propose Language-Guided Grasp Detection (LGGD) with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for robotic manipulation. LGGD leverages CLIP-based visual and textual embeddings within a hierarchical cross-modal fusion pipeline, progressively injecting linguistic cues into the visual feature reconstruction process. This design enables fine-grained visual-semantic alignment and improves the feasibility of the predicted grasps with respect to task instructions. In addition, we introduce a language-conditioned dynamic convolution head (LDCH) that mixes multiple convolution experts based on sentence-level features, enabling instruction-adaptive coarse mask and grasp predictions. A final refinement module further enhances grasp consistency and robustness in complex scenes.Experiments on the OCID-VLG and Grasp-Anything++ datasets show that LGGD surpasses existing language-guided grasping methods, exhibiting strong generalization to unseen objects and diverse language queries. Moreover, deployment on a real robotic platform demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach in executing accurate, instruction-conditioned grasp actions. The code will be released publicly upon acceptance.

TL;DR: This study explores a lightweight 2-DoF arm mounted on quadrotors for aerial manipulation, addressing challenges with reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial manipulators face constraints on weight, simplicity, and robustness while ensuring six-DoF pose control amidst disturbances.

Method: Reinforcement learning via PPO is used for generating commands, supported by INDI and PID controllers for robust control.

Result: Flight experiments achieved high precision in position and orientation, maintaining robust performance during external disturbances.

Conclusion: Learning-based control strategies enable effective aerial manipulation using simple and lightweight designs.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators, which combine robotic arms with multi-rotor drones, face strict constraints on arm weight and mechanical complexity. In this work, we study a lightweight 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) arm mounted on a quadrotor via a differential mechanism, capable of full six-DoF end-effector pose control. While the minimal design enables simplicity and reduced payload, it also introduces challenges such as underactuation and sensitivity to external disturbances, including manipulation of heavy loads and pushing tasks. To address these, we employ reinforcement learning, training a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in simulation to generate feedforward commands for quadrotor acceleration and body rates, along with joint angle targets. These commands are tracked by an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) attitude controller and a PID joint controller, respectively. Flight experiments demonstrate centimeter-level position accuracy and degree-level orientation precision, with robust performance under external force disturbances. The results highlight the potential of learning-based control strategies for enabling contact-rich aerial manipulation using simple, lightweight platforms.

*Chen Liang,Daniel Rakita*

TL;DR: The paper introduces WASP derivatives into MJPC as a replacement for finite differencing, accelerating derivative calculations and achieving up to 2x speed improvement in MPC tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and accuracy of MPC algorithms in MuJoCo by addressing the limitations of finite differencing in computing derivatives, especially for complex or high-degree-of-freedom systems.

Method: The authors propose using Web of Affine Spaces (WASP), a method for derivative calculation that reuses prior derivative computations to stabilize and speed up new calculations, within the MJPC framework.

Result: WASP demonstrated seamless integration, robust performance, and up to 2x speed improvement over finite differencing with derivative-based planners. It also outperformed stochastic sampling-based planners across various robotics tasks.

Conclusion: WASP derivatives enhance MJPC's performance by offering efficient and reliable derivative computation, making MPC accessible for time-sensitive applications. The implementation is available as open-source to encourage further adoption and research.

Abstract: MuJoCo is a powerful and efficient physics simulator widely used in robotics. One common way it is applied in practice is through Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses repeated rollouts of the simulator to optimize future actions and generate responsive control policies in real time. To make this process more accessible, the open source library MuJoCo MPC (MJPC) provides ready-to-use MPC algorithms and implementations built directly on top of the MuJoCo simulator. However, MJPC relies on finite differencing (FD) to compute derivatives through the underlying MuJoCo simulator, which is often a key bottleneck that can make it prohibitively costly for time-sensitive tasks, especially in high-DOF systems or complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce the use of Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) derivatives within MJPC as a drop-in replacement for FD. WASP is a recently developed approach for efficiently computing sequences of accurate derivative approximations. By reusing information from prior, related derivative calculations, WASP accelerates and stabilizes the computation of new derivatives, making it especially well suited for MPC's iterative, fine-grained updates over time. We evaluate WASP across a diverse suite of MJPC tasks spanning multiple robot embodiments. Our results suggest that WASP derivatives are particularly effective in MJPC: it integrates seamlessly across tasks, delivers consistently robust performance, and achieves up to a 2$\mathsf{x}$ speedup compared to an FD backend when used with derivative-based planners, such as iLQG. In addition, WASP-based MPC outperforms MJPC's stochastic sampling-based planners on our evaluation tasks, offering both greater efficiency and reliability. To support adoption and future research, we release an open-source implementation of MJPC with WASP derivatives fully integrated.

TL;DR: This paper proposes SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework for scalable and efficient traffic scene representation in multi-agent trajectory generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for multi-agent trajectory modeling are inefficient due to redundant graph structures and heavily parameterized networks, limiting their scalability in complex traffic scenarios.

Method: SparScene constructs a sparse graph structure using lane graph topology rather than depending on distance-based connections. A lightweight graph encoder is employed to efficiently aggregate agent-map and agent-agent interactions.

Result: SparScene achieves competitive results on the WOMD benchmark. It generates over 200 agent trajectories in less than 5 ms and scales up to 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with only 54 ms of inference time and low memory usage.

Conclusion: SparScene addresses inefficiency and scalability issues in multi-agent trajectory modeling by constructing sparse, structure-aware scene graphs. It offers a highly efficient and scalable solution, suitable for large-scale traffic scenes.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory generation is a core problem for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, efficiently modeling the dynamic interactions between numerous road users and infrastructures in complex scenes remains an open problem. Existing methods typically employ distance-based or fully connected dense graph structures to capture interaction information, which not only introduces a large number of redundant edges but also requires complex and heavily parameterized networks for encoding, thereby resulting in low training and inference efficiency, limiting scalability to large and complex traffic scenes. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose SparScene, a sparse graph learning framework designed for efficient and scalable traffic scene representation. Instead of relying on distance thresholds, SparScene leverages the lane graph topology to construct structure-aware sparse connections between agents and lanes, enabling efficient yet informative scene graph representation. SparScene adopts a lightweight graph encoder that efficiently aggregates agent-map and agent-agent interactions, yielding compact scene representations with substantially improved efficiency and scalability. On the motion prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), SparScene achieves competitive performance with remarkable efficiency. It generates trajectories for more than 200 agents in a scene within 5 ms and scales to more than 5,000 agents and 17,000 lanes with merely 54 ms of inference time with a GPU memory of 2.9 GB, highlighting its superior scalability for large-scale traffic scenes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm for autonomous drone swarms, revealing that simple local rules can achieve multiple collective behaviors and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create efficient, resilient, and flexible drone swarms inspired by animal group behavior using minimal interaction rules.

Method: The researchers employed a bio-inspired algorithm where drones interact with minimal neighbors using local alignment and attraction cues, systematically tuning interaction gains to map collective phases.

Result: Experiments with ten drones and simulations demonstrate sharp transitions between swarming and schooling phases and enhanced responsiveness to external disturbances near critical phase transitions.

Conclusion: Minimal local-interaction rules enable diverse collective behaviors, and simple gain modulation allows effective adjustments in the drone swarm's stability, flexibility, and resilience.

Abstract: Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.

TL;DR: Schrödinger's Navigator optimizes zero-shot object navigation by integrating trajectory-conditioned imagination and reasoning about future uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSON methods struggle in cluttered and dynamic environments, often due to occlusions, risks, or moving targets.

Method: Schrödinger's Navigator uses a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model to reason over unobserved spaces, imagining future observations to guide navigation effectively.

Result: Experiments on a real quadruped robot outperform existing methods in navigation success rate under challenging conditions like occlusions and risks.

Conclusion: Trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination improves robustness in ZSON tasks, enabling efficient navigation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) requires a robot to locate a target object in a previously unseen environment without relying on pre-built maps or task-specific training. However, existing ZSON methods often struggle in realistic and cluttered environments, particularly when the scene contains heavy occlusions, unknown risks, or dynamically moving target objects. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Schrödinger's Navigator}, a navigation framework inspired by Schrödinger's thought experiment on uncertainty. The framework treats unobserved space as a set of plausible future worlds and reasons over them before acting. Conditioned on egocentric visual inputs and three candidate trajectories, a trajectory-conditioned 3D world model imagines future observations along each path. This enables the agent to see beyond occlusions and anticipate risks in unseen regions without requiring extra detours or dense global mapping. The imagined 3D observations are fused into the navigation map and used to update a value map. These updates guide the policy toward trajectories that avoid occlusions, reduce exposure to uncertain space, and better track moving targets. Experiments on a Go2 quadruped robot across three challenging scenarios, including severe static occlusions, unknown risks, and dynamically moving targets, show that Schrödinger's Navigator consistently outperforms strong ZSON baselines in self-localization, object localization, and overall Success Rate in occlusion-heavy environments. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of trajectory-conditioned 3D imagination in enabling robust zero-shot object navigation.

Result: The system demonstrated precise CoP measurement with a 14.8 g error and achieved 100% balance success in 3° single-leg lifting tests using optimized PID parameters.

Conclusion: The wireless CoP feedback approach significantly enhances humanoid robot stability while preserving mechanical flexibility, validating its effectiveness for complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Maintaining stability during the single-support phase is a fundamental challenge in humanoid robotics, particularly in dance robots that require complex maneuvers and high mechanical freedom. Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.

Motivation: To address the challenge of collecting and aligning large-scale tactile data for robotic dexterous manipulation, especially under visual occlusion.

Method: The authors project tactile signals onto a consistent 2D surface model (MANO) and align them using contrastive learning with a small paired dataset.

Result: The approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to robots and improves performance via co-training on mixed tactile data.

Conclusion: UniTacHand promotes scalable, efficient learning for robotics by aligning human and robot tactile data, enhancing manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for robotic hands to achieve human-level dexterous manipulation, especially in scenarios with visual occlusion. However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.

Conclusion: Gamified data collection presents a scalable and engaging solution for gathering robot demonstration data, potentially broadening audience involvement and improving downstream robot tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations has become a dominant approach for training autonomous robot policies. However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.

*Anatoly O. Onishchenko,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LookPlanGraph, a method for embodied instruction-following tasks that dynamically updates scene graphs in response to environmental changes, outperforming static graph methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robotic environment interaction rely on static scene graphs, which don't adapt to real-time changes in the environment during task execution, limiting their applicability.

Method: LookPlanGraph continuously updates scene graphs using object priors and visual data from an agent's camera via Vision Language Models to ensure real-time task relevancy.

Result: Experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate LookPlanGraph's superiority over static scene graph methods. A new dataset, GraSIF, is also introduced for evaluation purposes.

Conclusion: LookPlanGraph offers a robust, adaptive approach to grounding LLMs for embodied tasks in dynamic environments, showing improved performance over static graph models.

Abstract: Methods that use Large Language Models (LLM) as planners for embodied instruction following tasks have become widespread. To successfully complete tasks, the LLM must be grounded in the environment in which the robot operates. One solution is to use a scene graph that contains all the necessary information. Modern methods rely on prebuilt scene graphs and assume that all task-relevant information is available at the start of planning. However, these approaches do not account for changes in the environment that may occur between the graph construction and the task execution. We propose LookPlanGraph - a method that leverages a scene graph composed of static assets and object priors. During plan execution, LookPlanGraph continuously updates the graph with relevant objects, either by verifying existing priors or discovering new entities. This is achieved by processing the agents egocentric camera view using a Vision Language Model. We conducted experiments with changed object positions VirtualHome and OmniGibson simulated environments, demonstrating that LookPlanGraph outperforms methods based on predefined static scene graphs. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach, we also conducted experiments in a real-world setting. Additionally, we introduce the GraSIF (Graph Scenes for Instruction Following) dataset with automated validation framework, comprising 514 tasks drawn from SayPlan Office, BEHAVIOR-1K, and VirtualHome RobotHow.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel natural language-based control framework for quadruped robots leveraging large language models to simplify operation for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interfaces for quadruped robots are highly technical, creating barriers for non-specialist users. This paper seeks to make robot navigation more intuitive.

Method: The researchers developed a distributed architecture utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for processing natural language commands. High-level instructions are processed externally to address computational limitations. Real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, Odometry) grounds commands into actionable movements.

Result: The system was tested in structured indoor scenarios, achieving a success rate exceeding 90% across tasks, demonstrating robust performance.

Conclusion: This approach validates that LLM-integrated frameworks can enable effective robot control in real-world conditions, reducing the complexity of operation.

Abstract: Traditional control interfaces for quadruped robots often impose a high barrier to entry, requiring specialized technical knowledge for effective operation. To address this, this paper presents a novel control framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intuitive, natural language-based navigation. We propose a distributed architecture where high-level instruction processing is offloaded to an external server to overcome the onboard computational constraints of the DeepRobotics Jueying Lite 3 platform. The system grounds LLM-generated plans into executable ROS navigation commands using real-time sensor fusion (LiDAR, IMU, and Odometry). Experimental validation was conducted in a structured indoor environment across four distinct scenarios, ranging from single-room tasks to complex cross-zone navigation. The results demonstrate the system's robustness, achieving an aggregate success rate of over 90\% across all scenarios, validating the feasibility of offloaded LLM-based planning for autonomous quadruped deployment in real-world settings.

### [219] [Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07611)
*Jingyang You,Hanna Kurniawati,Lashika Medagoda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM) for efficient inspection planning using neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). It achieves similar trajectory quality to state-of-the-art planners while using significantly less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies in memory usage of existing sampling-based inspection planners for large, complex structures.

Method: Proposes novel primitive computations (IPIM) that operate directly with implicit models like neural SDFs, eliminating frequent transformations between implicit and explicit models.

Result: IPIM enables sampling-based planners to create inspection trajectories of similar quality to state-of-the-art methods but with up to 70 times less memory usage.

Conclusion: IPIM provides an efficient approach for planning inspections of complex structures while greatly reducing memory requirements compared to traditional planners.

Abstract: The aging and increasing complexity of infrastructures make efficient inspection planning more critical in ensuring safety. Thanks to sampling-based motion planning, many inspection planners are fast. However, they often require huge memory. This is particularly true when the structure under inspection is large and complex, consisting of many struts and pillars of various geometry and sizes. Such structures can be represented efficiently using implicit models, such as neural Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). However, most primitive computations used in sampling-based inspection planner have been designed to work efficiently with explicit environment models, which in turn requires the planner to use explicit environment models or performs frequent transformations between implicit and explicit environment models during planning. This paper proposes a set of primitive computations, called Inspection Planning Primitives with Implicit Models (IPIM), that enable sampling-based inspection planners to entirely use neural SDFs representation during planning. Evaluation on three scenarios, including inspection of a complex real-world structure with over 92M triangular mesh faces, indicates that even a rudimentary sampling-based planner with IPIM can generate inspection trajectories of similar quality to those generated by the state-of-the-art planner, while using up to 70x less memory than the state-of-the-art inspection planner.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a new perspective on data-driven process analysis that integrates technical processes with human and organizational concerns, termed as process analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the decreasing awareness of the multifaceted analysis of business processes, particularly the neglect of human and organizational concerns in current approaches focusing primarily on technical aspects.

Method: The paper conceptualizes process analytics through an inductive and deductive approach and contrasts it with a real-life case study of a large company's implementation of data-driven process analysis and automation.

Result: The conceptualization highlights new dimensions of process analytics, integrating technical analysis with societal and organizational dynamics, and is supported by practical insights from the case study.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of a socio-technical perspective in data-driven process analysis, advocating for considering organizational and human factors alongside technical concerns.

Abstract: Data-driven analysis of business processes has a long tradition in research. However, recently the term of process mining is mostly used when referring to data-driven process analysis. As a consequence, awareness for the many facets of process analysis is decreasing. In particular, while an increasing focus is put onto technical aspects of the analysis, human and organisational concerns remain under the radar. Following the socio-technical perspective of information systems research, we propose a new perspective onto data-driven process analysis that combines the process of analysis with the organisation and its stakeholders. This paper conceptualises the term process analytics and its various dimensions by following both an inductive and deductive approach. The results are discussed by contrasting them to a real-life case study from a large company implementing data-driven process analysis and automation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoNavigator, an LLM agent with execution-aware tools using Reinforcement Learning (RL), effectively locates modification points in large open-source software (OSS) repositories, outperforming larger closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity and inefficiency of finding modifications in large OSS repositories by simplifying the retrieval process and improving code execution awareness.

Method: Developed RepoNavigator, an LLM agent trained using end-to-end RL, equipped with a unified, execution-aware tool for navigating code execution, without reliance on closed-source distillation.

Result: RepoNavigator exhibits superior performance compared to larger, closed-source models, demonstrating efficiency and scalability in localizing repository-level issues.

Conclusion: Integrating an execution-grounded tool and RL training creates a scalable and effective approach for identifying modification points in OSS repositories.

Abstract: Locating the files and functions requiring modification in large open-source software (OSS) repositories is challenging due to their scale and structural complexity. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods typically treat this as a repository-level retrieval task and rely on multiple auxiliary tools, which overlook code execution logic and complicate model control. We propose RepoNavigator, an LLM agent equipped with a single execution-aware tool-jumping to the definition of an invoked symbol. This unified design reflects the actual flow of code execution while simplifying tool manipulation. RepoNavigator is trained end-to-end via Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly from a pretrained model, without any closed-source distillation. Experiments demonstrate that RL-trained RepoNavigator achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the 7B model outperforming 14B baselines, the 14B model surpassing 32B competitors, and even the 32B model exceeding closed-source models such as Claude-3.7. These results confirm that integrating a single, structurally grounded tool with RL training provides an efficient and scalable solution for repository-level issue localization.

*Oussama Ben Sghaier,Kevin Delcourt,Houari Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models adapt code generation strategies in scenarios where test cases and restrictions are exposed through prompting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the tension between the pretraining objectives of LLMs and their behavior under alignment constraints, specifically in agentic AI contexts like code validation through unit tests.

Method: The study uses the BigCodeBench dataset with five designed prompting conditions that vary test visibility and restrictions. It evaluates five LLMs on metrics like correctness and code similarity and analyzes patterns in model behavior.

Result: Test visibility significantly impacts performance, with correctness nearly doubling for some models. Explicit restrictions partially mitigate test visibility effects, and four recurring adaptation strategies were identified.

Conclusion: LLMs adapt to contextual signals that oppose explicit instructions, with test-driven refinement being the most frequent adaptation strategy. This insight reveals how models balance pretraining objectives against alignment constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the software security expertise of five leading large language models (LLMs) using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the extent of software security comprehension in LLMs, as their security expertise is unclear despite their growing use in software development.

Method: The methods involve evaluating LLMs across six cognitive dimensions using diverse datasets such as multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets, course tasks, case studies, and project-based assessments.

Result: LLMs perform well on lower-order cognitive tasks but struggle with higher-order reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Additionally, 51 recurring misconception patterns were identified.

Conclusion: While LLMs are proficient in basic security tasks, their effectiveness diminishes in complex reasoning and secure system creation, highlighting the need for improvement in higher-order cognitive security skills.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, but their level of software security expertise remains unclear. This work systematically evaluates the security comprehension of five leading LLMs: GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-5-Mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5, using Blooms Taxonomy as a framework. We assess six cognitive dimensions: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Our methodology integrates diverse datasets, including curated multiple-choice questions, vulnerable code snippets (SALLM), course assessments from an Introduction to Software Security course, real-world case studies (XBOW), and project-based creation tasks from a Secure Software Engineering course. Results show that while LLMs perform well on lower-level cognitive tasks such as recalling facts and identifying known vulnerabilities, their performance degrades significantly on higher-order tasks that require reasoning, architectural evaluation, and secure system creation. Beyond reporting aggregate accuracy, we introduce a software security knowledge boundary that identifies the highest cognitive level at which a model consistently maintains reliable performance. In addition, we identify 51 recurring misconception patterns exhibited by LLMs across Blooms levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and decode the neural basis of predictive inference in human language processing, specifically in Deaf signers, using dynamic visual stimuli.

Method: Developed a framework using coherence between EEG signals and motion features derived from optical flow, incorporating spatiotemporal representation and entropy-based feature selection to identify distinct neural dynamics.

Result: Key findings include low-frequency coherence in the left hemisphere and frontal regions as significant for language comprehension, with age-related, experience-dependent neural signatures.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel multimodal technique to explore experience-driven generative models in the brain, facilitating insights into neural mechanisms of language perception and comprehension.

Abstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.

TL;DR: This paper explores sampling outcomes that maximize information about world models, focusing on structure learning using active inference and Bayesian Model Reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance understanding of structure learning by creating a method to sample outcomes that optimize model disambiguation.

Method: Active inference is used by selecting policies based on expected free energy, incorporating information gain via Bayesian Model Reduction.

Result: An efficient approach for resolving uncertainty in world models through optimal experimental design is demonstrated using the 'three-ball' paradigm.

Conclusion: Sampling outcomes that maximize information about world models is effective for resolving uncertainty and advancing structure learning within active inference frameworks.

Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

TL;DR: The authors propose the PALB method for exact LAD line fitting, improving computational efficiency and robustness compared to LP-based and IRLS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the lack of accessible, maintained public implementations for robust LAD line fitting algorithms, which are computationally complex.

Method: PALB is an exact algorithm using supporting lines from subgradients to construct piecewise-affine lower bounds, accompanied by a subdivision scheme.

Result: PALB demonstrates log-linear scaling efficiency across synthetic and real datasets, outperforming other methods in accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: PALB provides a robust, fast solution to LAD line fitting with readily available open-source implementation in Rust and Python.

Abstract: Least-absolute-deviations (LAD) line fitting is robust to outliers but computationally more involved than least squares regression. Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API.

Result: Findings demonstrate improved efficiency and statistical accuracy of diffusion models, providing flexibility and applicability across different parameter dimensions, budgets, and model frameworks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models represent a highly adaptable and accurate tool for simulation-based inference, with significant opportunities for refinement and broad application in future research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful learners for simulation-based inference (SBI), enabling fast and accurate estimation of latent parameters from simulated and real data. Their score-based formulation offers a flexible way to learn conditional or joint distributions over parameters and observations, thereby providing a versatile solution to various modeling problems. In this tutorial review, we synthesize recent developments on diffusion models for SBI, covering design choices for training, inference, and evaluation. We highlight opportunities created by various concepts such as guidance, score composition, flow matching, consistency models, and joint modeling. Furthermore, we discuss how efficiency and statistical accuracy are affected by noise schedules, parameterizations, and samplers. Finally, we illustrate these concepts with case studies across parameter dimensionalities, simulation budgets, and model types, and outline open questions for future research.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces weighted versions of Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to assess classifier performance when observations have varying importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing performance measures for classification tasks do not account for varying weights assigned to individual observations, which can affect classifier evaluation.

Method: A weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification and related weighted measures for multiclass tasks are proposed, with analysis showing their robustness to weight changes.

Result: The weighted measures demonstrate improved distinction for classifiers excelling on high-weight observations, while unweighted measures fail to account for varying observation importance.

Conclusion: The weighted MCC effectively evaluates classifiers based on weighted observations and provides robustness against small weight variations.

Abstract: Several performance measures are used to evaluate binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  But individual observations may often have distinct weights, and none of these measures are sensitive to such varying weights.
  We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:
  if the weights are changed by at most $ε$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $ε$ in the binary case
  and by a factor of $ε^2$ in the multiclass case.
  Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP) to improve outbreak prediction in regions with sparse historical infectious disease data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse count data in fields like infectious disease prediction present statistical challenges, particularly in regions with no historical cases, requiring robust solutions.

Method: The paper develops the PHIBP, a framework that borrows statistical strength across regions, leveraging absolute abundance concepts and avoiding pitfalls of relative-rate methods in sparse data.

Result: The PHIBP effectively predicts outbreaks in sparse-data regions, generates coherent predictive distributions, and utilizes comparative measures like alpha and beta diversity in experiments.

Conclusion: The PHIBP is a unified framework offering accurate outbreak predictions and epidemiological insights in sparse data settings, confirmed by experimental application.

Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the slow sampling issue in diffusion models by enhancing training data using Gaussianization preprocessing to improve reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome slow and inefficient sampling in diffusion models that hampers reconstruction quality, especially in early stages.

Method: The authors propose preprocessing training data using Gaussianization to align the target distribution with an independent Gaussian, simplifying model learning.

Result: The method improves early-stage reconstruction quality and enhances generation output, especially for small network architectures.

Conclusion: Gaussianization preprocessing is effective for improving sampling and reconstruction in diffusion models, with potential applications across generative tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image generation. However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A new Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework is proposed for marketing attribution using aggregated impression-level data, avoiding user-level tracking and maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations and platform restrictions have limited the availability of user-level path data, challenging traditional marketing attribution methods.

Method: The CDA framework integrates temporal causal discovery (PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to deduce channel influence from aggregated data.

Result: On synthetic datasets, CDA shows impressive accuracy with an average relative RMSE of 9.50% using the true graph and 24.23% with a predicted structure.

Conclusion: The CDA approach offers a privacy-preserving, interpretable, and scalable solution for attribution modelling, making it a forward-looking alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.

Conclusion: This framework effectively improves multi-agent coordination and performance in uncertain environments with limited communication, offering a practical solution for real-world challenges.

Abstract: Multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental for effective and safe autonomous operation. In many real-world scenarios, each agent maintains its own belief over the environment and must plan actions accordingly. However, most existing approaches assume that all agents have identical beliefs at planning time, implying these beliefs are conditioned on the same data. Such an assumption is often impractical due to limited communication. In reality, agents frequently operate with inconsistent beliefs, which can lead to poor coordination and suboptimal, potentially unsafe, performance. In this paper, we address this critical challenge by introducing a novel decentralized framework for optimal joint action selection that explicitly accounts for belief inconsistencies. Our approach provides probabilistic guarantees for both action consistency and performance with respect to open-loop multi-agent POMDP (which assumes all data is always communicated), and selectively triggers communication only when needed. Furthermore, we address another key aspect of whether, given a chosen joint action, the agents should share data to improve expected performance in inference. Simulation results show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

### [233] [Efficient Asynchronous Federated Evaluation with Strategy Similarity Awareness for Intent-Based Networking in Industrial Internet of Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20627)
*Shaowen Qin,Jianfeng Zeng,Haodong Guo,Xiaohuan Li,Jiawen Kang,Qian Chen,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes FEIBN, a framework for intelligent network control in IIoT systems, using federated learning to enable distributed verification and enhance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve issues in IIoT like frequent deployment rollbacks, privacy constraints, and inefficiency in centralized policy verification.

Method: FEIBN uses large language models for intent alignment and federated learning for distributed policy verification. It also proposes SSAFL to enhance efficiency by selecting task-relevant nodes and reducing communication overhead.

Result: Experiments confirm that SSAFL improves model accuracy, accelerates convergence, and reduces costs by 27.8% compared to SemiAsyn.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses IIoT challenges, offering a more efficient and practical approach to deploying and verifying strategies in IBN systems.

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) offers a promising paradigm for intelligent and automated network control in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments by translating high-level user intents into executable network strategies. However, frequent strategy deployment and rollback are impractical in real-world IIoT systems due to tightly coupled workflows and high downtime costs, while the heterogeneity and privacy constraints of IIoT nodes further complicate centralized policy verification. To address these challenges, we propose FEIBN, a Federated Evaluation Enhanced Intent-Based Networking framework. FEIBN leverages large language models (LLMs) to align multimodal user intents into structured strategy tuples and employs federated learning to perform distributed policy verification across IIoT nodes without exposing raw data. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication overhead, we design SSAFL, a Strategy Similarity Aware Federated Learning mechanism that selects task-relevant nodes based on strategy similarity and resource status, and triggers asynchronous model uploads only when updates are significant. Experiments demonstrate that SSAFL can improve model accuracy, accelerate model convergence, and reduce the cost by 27.8% compared with SemiAsyn.

Motivation: Address spectrum scarcity and reduce energy consumption to meet 6G goals such as Tb/s data rates, massive connectivity, and minimal latency.

Method: Integrates deep reinforcement learning with transfer learning, energy harvesting, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and lightweight genetic operations.

Result: Results show 25-30% reduced energy consumption, sensing AUC > 0.90, and 6-13 p.p. higher packet delivery rate compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable for IoT and vehicular applications, providing a green and feasible solution for 6G CRNs.

Abstract: The 6G wireless aims at the Tb/s peak data rates are expected, a sub-millisecond latency, massive Internet of Things/vehicle connectivity, which requires sustainable access to audio over the air and energy-saving functionality. Cognitive Radio Networks CCNs help in alleviating the problem of spectrum scarcity, but classical sensing and allocation are still energy-consumption intensive, and sensitive to rapid spectrum variations. Our framework which centers on AI driven green CRN aims at integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with transfer learning, energy harvesting (EH), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with other light-weight genetic refinement operations that optimally combine sensing timelines, transmit power, bandwidth distribution and RIS phase selection. Compared to two baselines, the utilization of MATLAB + NS-3 under dense loads, a traditional CRN with energy sensing under fixed policies, and a hybrid CRN with cooperative sensing under heuristic distribution of resource, there are (25-30%) fewer energy reserves used, sensing AUC greater than 0.90 and +6-13 p.p. higher PDR. The integrated framework is easily scalable to large IoT and vehicular applications, and it provides a feasible and sustainable roadmap to 6G CRNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance real-time biomedical edge computing for WBAN users, addressing user task criticality, mobility, and UAV energy constraints.

Method: The approach involves creating an AI-enabled framework with a Transformer-based mobility prediction model and a prediction-enhanced DRL algorithm for optimizing UAV trajectory and task allocation.

Result: Using real-world data, the results show improved performance of the proposed framework compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that AI-enhanced edge computing frameworks improve UAV operation efficiency in healthcare IoMT applications under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.

### [237] [A Physics Informed Neural Network For Deriving MHD State Vectors From Global Active Regions Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20747)
*Subhamoy Chatterjee,Mausumi Dikpati*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PINNBARDS, a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct initial state-vectors for magnetic structures in the Sun's tachocline using observations, enhancing week-scale prediction of solar active regions (ARs) and their flares.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to predict solar active region emergence weeks in advance to better understand and forecast solar flares. Current observation methods only provide geometric data, not the detailed state-vectors necessary for initializing predictive MHD models.

Method: The authors developed PINNBARDS, a Physics-Informed Neural Network, which reconstructs initial state-vectors of the Sun's tachocline magnetic structures from observed geometric patterns and MHD models.

Result: PINNBARDS generates physically consistent toroid configurations with key characteristics: antisymmetric structure and field strengths optimal at 20-30 kG, aligning with observational data. These results improve our understanding of tachocline dynamics.

Conclusion: This approach enables the extraction of hidden magnetic state-vectors from surface observations, potentially allowing accurate prediction of flare-producing solar active regions weeks in advance.

Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) do not appear randomly but cluster along longitudinally warped toroidal bands ('toroids') that encode information about magnetic structures in the tachocline, where global-scale organization likely originates. Global MagnetoHydroDynamic Shallow-Water Tachocline (MHD-SWT) models have shown potential to simulate such toroids, matching observations qualitatively. For week-scale early prediction of flare-producing AR emergence, forward-integration of these toroids is necessary. This requires model initialization with a dynamically self-consistent MHD state-vector that includes magnetic, flow fields, and shell-thickness variations. However, synoptic magnetograms provide only geometric shape of toroids, not the state-vector needed to initialize MHD-SWT models. To address this challenging task, we develop PINNBARDS, a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)-Based AR Distribution Simulator, that uses observational toroids and MHD-SWT equations to derive initial state-vector. Using Feb-14-2024 SDO/HMI synoptic map, we show that PINN converges to physically consistent, predominantly antisymmetric toroids, matching observed ones. Although surface data provides north and south toroids' central latitudes, and their latitudinal widths, they cannot determine tachocline field strengths, connected to AR emergence. We explore here solutions across a broad parameter range, finding hydrodynamically-dominated structures for weak fields (~2 kG) and overly rigid behavior for strong fields (~100 kG). We obtain best agreement with observations for 20-30 kG toroidal fields, and ~10 degree bandwidth, consistent with low-order longitudinal mode excitation. To our knowledge, PINNBARDS serves as the first method for reconstructing state-vectors for hidden tachocline magnetic structures from surface patterns; potentially leading to weeks ahead prediction of flare-producing AR-emergence.

*Murdoch J. Gabbay*

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how to specify distributed algorithms using modal logic theories, with examples such as voting, broadcast, and agreement protocols, and their application in finding errors in an industrial protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a precise, human-readable, and high-level specification of distributed system properties while abstracting away from implementational details, enabling better reasoning, verification, and design improvements.

Method: Using modal logic to represent distributed algorithms declaratively, focusing on system properties instead of low-level machine transitions.

Result: The methods have been shown to effectively find errors in a proposed industrial protocol, demonstrating scalability and utility.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates improved reasoning about correctness and resilience, assisting human and machine verification while enabling better protocol design and alternative implementations.

Abstract: We demonstrate how to formally specify distributed algorithms as declarative axiomatic theories in a modal logic. We exhibit the method on a simple voting protocol, a simple broadcast protocol, and a simple agreement protocol. The methods scale well and have been used to find errors in a proposed industrial protocol. The key novelty is to use modal logic to capture a declarative, high-level representation of essential system properties -- the logical essence of the algorithm -- while abstracting away from transitions of an abstract machine that implements it. It is like the difference between specifying code in a functional or logic programming language, versus specifying code in an imperative one.
  A logical axiomatisation in the style we propose provides a precise, compact, human-readable specification that abstractly captures essential system properties, while eliding low-level implementation details; it is more precise than a natural language description, yet more abstract than source code or a logical specification thereof. This creates new opportunities for reasoning about correctness, resilience, and failure, and could serve as a foundation for human- and machine verification efforts, design improvements, and even alternative protocol implementations.

*Stefano Grassi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a framework to address coordination challenges in multi-agent systems, utilizing Differentiable Price Mechanisms for efficient and scalable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inherent fragility of autonomous multi-agent systems in solving coordination problems like eliciting dispersed private knowledge and aligning local actions with global objectives.

Method: The proposed Mechanism-Based Intelligence employs Differentiable Price Mechanisms to align incentives and optimize coordination by computing loss gradients and ensuring incentive compatibility under various conditions.

Result: The framework achieves scalability with linear computational complexity (O(N)) and shows empirical efficiency, being 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning methods.

Conclusion: Mechanism-Based Intelligence structurally aligns agent self-interest with collective goals, offering a trustworthy, efficient, and generalizable approach to multi-agent coordination based on economic principles.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent systems are fundamentally fragile: they struggle to solve the Hayekian Information problem (eliciting dispersed private knowledge) and the Hurwiczian Incentive problem (aligning local actions with global objectives), making coordination computationally intractable. I introduce Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI), a paradigm that reconceptualizes intelligence as emergent from the coordination of multiple "brains", rather than a single one. At its core, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) computes the exact loss gradient $$ \mathbf{G}_i = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_i} $$ as a dynamic, VCG-equivalent incentive signal, guaranteeing Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) and convergence to the global optimum. A Bayesian extension ensures incentive compatibility under asymmetric information (BIC). The framework scales linearly ($\mathcal{O}(N)$) with the number of agents, bypassing the combinatorial complexity of Dec-POMDPs and is empirically 50x faster than Model-Free Reinforcement Learning. By structurally aligning agent self-interest with collective objectives, it provides a provably efficient, auditable and generalizable approach to coordinated, trustworthy and scalable multi-agent intelligence grounded in economic principles.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to multi-agent tasks by using human-interpretable source code for policies and Large Language Models (LLMs) as interpreters, addressing challenges in strategy adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of representing and adapting strategies in multi-agent tasks due to the opaque and high-dimensional nature of neural policies, which make direct conditioning on opponents' strategies intractable.

Method: The authors introduce Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR), a method where policies are represented as source code and improved iteratively. LLMs interpret and optimize these programmatic policies with textual gradients informed by game utility and runtime feedback.

Result: The method successfully addresses challenges in strategy adaptation and demonstrates effectiveness in standard coordination games and a Level-Based Foraging environment.

Conclusion: Programmatic policy representation and LLM-driven optimization can effectively enhance multi-agent coordination and adaptation, offering a novel paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In multi-agent tasks, the central challenge lies in the dynamic adaptation of strategies. However, directly conditioning on opponents' strategies is intractable in the prevalent deep reinforcement learning paradigm due to a fundamental ``representational bottleneck'': neural policies are opaque, high-dimensional parameter vectors that are incomprehensible to other agents. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift that bridges this gap by representing policies as human-interpretable source code and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as approximate interpreters. This programmatic representation allows us to operationalize the game-theoretic concept of \textit{Program Equilibrium}. We reformulate the learning problem by utilizing LLMs to perform optimization directly in the space of programmatic policies. The LLM functions as a point-wise best-response operator that iteratively synthesizes and refines the ego agent's policy code to respond to the opponent's strategy. We formalize this process as \textit{Programmatic Iterated Best Response (PIBR)}, an algorithm where the policy code is optimized by textual gradients, using structured feedback derived from game utility and runtime unit tests. We demonstrate that this approach effectively solves several standard coordination matrix games and a cooperative Level-Based Foraging environment.

TL;DR: This paper explores how indirect reciprocity (IR) can be applied to human-AI interactions, specifically focusing on children-robot interactions and cooperative learning using algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand trust, prosociality, and cooperation in human-AI teamwork, drawing inspiration from mechanisms like indirect reciprocity (IR) in human interactions.

Method: Combines laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling to study IR in human-AI groups, focusing on children-robot interactions and learning dynamics.

Result: It finds that IR is applicable to children-robot interactions; children’s cooperation strategies can train algorithms, and multi-armed bandit algorithms can facilitate human-AI cooperation depending on human signals.

Conclusion: IR can extend to human-AI interactions, particularly in scenarios involving children and robots, highlighting the importance of human-provided strategies for effective cooperative learning algorithms.

Abstract: Social interactions increasingly involve artificial agents, such as conversational or collaborative bots. Understanding trust and prosociality in these settings is fundamental to improve human-AI teamwork. Research in biology and social sciences has identified mechanisms to sustain cooperation among humans. Indirect reciprocity (IR) is one of them. With IR, helping someone can enhance an individual's reputation, nudging others to reciprocate in the future. Transposing IR to human-AI interactions is however challenging, as differences in human demographics, moral judgements, and agents' learning dynamics can affect how interactions are assessed. To study IR in human-AI groups, we combine laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling. We investigate whether 1) indirect reciprocity can be transposed to children-robot interactions; 2) artificial agents can learn to cooperate given children's strategies; and 3) how differences in learning algorithms impact human-AI cooperation. We find that IR extends to children and robots solving coordination dilemmas. Furthermore, we observe that the strategies revealed by children provide a sufficient signal for multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn cooperative actions. Beyond the experimental scenarios, we observe that cooperating through multi-armed bandit algorithms is highly dependent on the strategies revealed by humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately detecting cybersickness in virtual reality users using EEG data, overcoming confounding factors from visual stimuli.

Method: Employment of convolutional neural networks and transformers for EEG data interpretation with visual analysis tools, focusing on ERP responses during sickness elicitation.

Result: Classification models identified salient features near the left prefrontal cortex as influential for detecting cybersickness, promising improved precision.

Conclusion: The identified brain region can serve as a tagged feature for real-time EEG-based cybersickness classification, aiding VR experience improvements.

Abstract: Cybersickness poses a serious challenge for users of virtual reality (VR) technology. Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

TL;DR: The paper studies the relationships between key learning factors (experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation) in AI-driven classrooms across middle and high school students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the structure of relationships between essential learning factors varies in AI-mediated schooling, especially across different age groups.

Method: Authentic classroom experiments, where middle and high school students used AI tools for programming activities, with data collection on learning factors. Multimethod quantitative analysis combining correlation and text mining was employed.

Result: Middle school students showed strong correlations among learning dimensions, while high school students presented more independent evaluations, with weaker correlations between dimensions.

Conclusion: Age and developmental stages significantly influence how students perceive and interact with learning factors in AI-mediated environments, with implications for tailoring AI integration strategies by age group.

Abstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.

TL;DR: This paper examines the effectiveness of GNNs for epidemic source detection, evaluates existing methods, proposes an optimized GNN design, and concludes that GNNs outshine traditional approaches across varying settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) truly outperform traditional methods in the epidemic source detection problem, which has become relevant due to existing research and shortcomings in current methodologies.

Method: The authors review existing GNN-based methods, propose a new GNN architecture tailored for source detection, and evaluate its performance through systematic experiments on varied network types.

Result: The proposed GNN-based model performed significantly better than other source detection methods, demonstrating exceptional accuracy across various network configurations.

Conclusion: The study reveals the effectiveness of GNNs for source detection, making it a compelling benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures. All associated code and data have been released to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: The source detection problem arises when an epidemic process unfolds over a contact network, and the objective is to identify its point of origin, i.e., the source node. Research on this problem began with the seminal work of Shah and Zaman in 2010, who formally defined it and introduced the notion of rumor centrality. With the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), several studies have proposed GNN-based approaches to source detection. However, some of these works lack methodological clarity and/or are hard to reproduce. As a result, it remains unclear (to us, at least) whether GNNs truly outperform more traditional source detection methods across comparable settings. In this paper, we first review existing GNN-based methods for source detection, clearly outlining the specific settings each addresses and the models they employ. Building on this research, we propose a principled GNN architecture tailored to the source detection task. We also systematically investigate key questions surrounding this problem. Most importantly, we aim to provide a definitive assessment of how GNNs perform relative to other source detection methods. Our experiments show that GNNs substantially outperform all other methods we test across a variety of network types. Although we initially set out to challenge the notion of GNNs as a solution to source detection, our results instead demonstrate their remarkable effectiveness for this task. We discuss possible reasons for this strong performance. To ensure full reproducibility, we release all code and data on GitHub. Finally, we argue that epidemic source detection should serve as a benchmark task for evaluating GNN architectures.

### [245] [A Community-Enhanced Graph Representation Model for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21166)
*Lei Wang,Darong Lai*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework, which uses community structures to improve the accuracy of link prediction tasks, overcoming limitations in Graph Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Neural Networks often fail to outperform heuristic methods in link prediction because they focus excessively on local node representations, leading to challenges such as over-smoothing and neglecting structural relationships.

Method: The CELP framework incorporates community-aware edge modification (completion and pruning) and integrates multi-scale structural features to model local and global graph topology for enhanced link prediction.

Result: Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional methods and existing GNNs.

Conclusion: Community structure plays a key role in improving link prediction tasks, and the CELP framework effectively leverages this to overcome existing limitations in GNN models.

Abstract: Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for graph representation learning, their performance on link prediction tasks does not always surpass that of traditional heuristic methods such as Common Neighbors and Jaccard Coefficient. This is mainly because existing GNNs tend to focus on learning local node representations, making it difficult to effectively capture structural relationships between node pairs. Furthermore, excessive reliance on local neighborhood information can lead to over-smoothing. Prior studies have shown that introducing global structural encoding can partially alleviate this issue. To address these limitations, we propose a Community-Enhanced Link Prediction (CELP) framework that incorporates community structure to jointly model local and global graph topology. Specifically, CELP enhances the graph via community-aware, confidence-guided edge completion and pruning, while integrating multi-scale structural features to achieve more accurate link prediction. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CELP achieves superior performance, validating the crucial role of community structure in improving link prediction accuracy.

*Zhe Wang,Jinghang Li,Yifei Zhu*

TL;DR: AirGS is a framework for free-viewpoint video that improves quality, reduces training times, and decreases storage requirements, optimizing dynamic video reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of AirGS is motivated by the limitations of current 4D Gaussian Splatting techniques, which face quality degradation over long sequences, high bandwidth requirements, and significant storage overhead, hindering real-time and large-scale applications.

Method: AirGS rearchitects the 4DGS pipeline by converting Gaussian video streams into 2D formats, identifying keyframes, using inflation loss to improve temporal coherence, and employing a pruning algorithm for communication-efficient data transmission.

Result: Experiments show AirGS reduces PSNR quality deviation by over 20%, maintains PSNR above 30, speeds up training by 6×, and halves the transmission size compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AirGS demonstrates its effectiveness in maintaining high video quality while significantly advancing the efficiency of training and data transmission, making it suitable for real-time and scalable applications.

Abstract: Free-viewpoint video (FVV) enables immersive viewing experiences by allowing users to view scenes from arbitrary perspectives. As a prominent reconstruction technique for FVV generation, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) models dynamic scenes with time-varying 3D Gaussian ellipsoids and achieves high-quality rendering via fast rasterization. However, existing 4DGS approaches suffer from quality degradation over long sequences and impose substantial bandwidth and storage overhead, limiting their applicability in real-time and wide-scale deployments. Therefore, we present AirGS, a streaming-optimized 4DGS framework that rearchitects the training and delivery pipeline to enable high-quality, low-latency FVV experiences. AirGS converts Gaussian video streams into multi-channel 2D formats and intelligently identifies keyframes to enhance frame reconstruction quality. It further combines temporal coherence with inflation loss to reduce training time and representation size. To support communication-efficient transmission, AirGS models 4DGS delivery as an integer linear programming problem and design a lightweight pruning level selection algorithm to adaptively prune the Gaussian updates to be transmitted, balancing reconstruction quality and bandwidth consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AirGS reduces quality deviation in PSNR by more than 20% when scene changes, maintains frame-level PSNR consistently above 30, accelerates training by 6 times, reduces per-frame transmission size by nearly 50% compared to the SOTA 4DGS approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for creating 3D head avatars struggle with generalization in extreme scenarios and underutilize geometric structure, limiting accuracy in complex poses and expressions.

Method: TexAvatars leverage CNNs to predict geometric attributes in UV space while using mesh-aware Jacobians for smooth transitions and semantic control.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high realism, handling extreme expressions and poses effectively.

Conclusion: TexAvatars provide enhanced generalization, interpretability, and stability, offering a robust solution for creating photorealistic and drivable 3D head avatars.

Abstract: Constructing drivable and photorealistic 3D head avatars has become a central task in AR/XR, enabling immersive and expressive user experiences. With the emergence of high-fidelity and efficient representations such as 3D Gaussians, recent works have pushed toward ultra-detailed head avatars. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: rule-based analytic rigging or neural network-based deformation fields. While effective in constrained settings, both approaches often fail to generalize to unseen expressions and poses, particularly in extreme reenactment scenarios. Other methods constrain Gaussians to the global texel space of 3DMMs to reduce rendering complexity. However, these texel-based avatars tend to underutilize the underlying mesh structure. They apply minimal analytic deformation and rely heavily on neural regressors and heuristic regularization in UV space, which weakens geometric consistency and limits extrapolation to complex, out-of-distribution deformations. To address these limitations, we introduce TexAvatars, a hybrid avatar representation that combines the explicit geometric grounding of analytic rigging with the spatial continuity of texel space. Our approach predicts local geometric attributes in UV space via CNNs, but drives 3D deformation through mesh-aware Jacobians, enabling smooth and semantically meaningful transitions across triangle boundaries. This hybrid design separates semantic modeling from geometric control, resulting in improved generalization, interpretability, and stability. Furthermore, TexAvatars captures fine-grained expression effects, including muscle-induced wrinkles, glabellar lines, and realistic mouth cavity geometry, with high fidelity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under extreme pose and expression variations, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging head reenactment settings.

### [248] [Variationally correct operator learning: Reduced basis neural operator with a posteriori error estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21319)
*Yuan Qiu,Wolfgang Dahmen,Peng Chen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a variationally correct neural operator learning framework utilizing FOSLS objectives and a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO) to ensure accuracy in PDE-induced norms with improved theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator approaches lack variational correctness, leading to inconsistent results and unreliable boundary condition handling in PDE-residual minimization.

Method: The authors develop an operator learning framework with FOSLS objectives ensuring a match between residual values and solution errors, and propose a RBNO architecture to predict coefficients in a conforming basis to ensure stability.

Result: The framework achieves rigorous convergence bounds and superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms, surpassing standard baselines. It also provides a computable a posteriori error estimator.

Conclusion: This paper advances neural operator learning by ensuring variational correctness, offering a provably stable and accurate method for handling PDE problems with practical and theoretical improvements.

Abstract: Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity, finding significant productivity improvements tied to model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how the scaling of AI models impacts professional productivity across various tasks to predict AI's potential role in boosting economic growth.

Method: A preregistered experiment involving over 500 professionals (e.g., consultants, data analysts, and managers) working on tasks with 13 LLMs was conducted to analyze productivity outcomes.

Result: Each year of AI progress led to an 8% reduction in task time, with 56% of productivity growth attributed to increased compute and 44% to algorithmic improvements. Non-agentic analytical tasks saw more significant gains than agentic workflows.

Conclusion: Continued scaling of AI models could lead to an approximate 20% increase in U.S. productivity over the next decade, though the benefits might vary by task type.

Abstract: This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven by increased compute and 44% by algorithmic progress. However, productivity gains were significantly larger for non-agentic analytical tasks compared to agentic workflows requiring tool use. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by approximately 20% over the next decade.

*Xiao-Qi Han,Ze-Feng Gao,Peng-Jie Guo,Zhong-Yi Lu*

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhononBench, a benchmark for evaluating dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals, revealing limitations in current generative models and providing openly accessible resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating dynamical stability for AI-generated crystals and aid in the design of physically viable materials through a systematic benchmark.

Method: Utilized the MatterSim interatomic potential to achieve accurate phonon predictions and tested the dynamical stability of 108,843 AI-generated crystal structures from six models.

Result: The analysis showed low dynamical-stability rates (average 25.83%) among the generated structures. Space-group-controlled approaches showed some improvement. Identified 28,119 phonon-stable crystal structures for further study.

Conclusion: PhononBench highlights the limitations of current crystal generation models, offering critical evaluation benchmarks and resources to guide model improvements toward more stable material generation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReaSeq is a recommender system framework that enhances item representation and user interest modeling using reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the fundamental limitations of industrial recommender systems: ID-based knowledge poverty and lack of beyond-log user interest modeling.

Method: ReaSeq integrates explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning and latent reasoning using multi-agent collaboration and Diffusion Large Language Models to enrich item representation and infer beyond-log behaviors.

Result: Deployment of ReaSeq on Taobao's system showed significant improvements: over 6.0% in IPV and CTR, over 2.9% in Orders, and over 2.5% in GMV.

Conclusion: World-knowledge-enhanced reasoning, enabled by Large Language Models, effectively overcomes the limitations of log-driven recommendation systems, improving both representation and behavior inference for better performance.

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems face two fundamental limitations under the log-driven paradigm: (1) knowledge poverty in ID-based item representations that causes brittle interest modeling under data sparsity, and (2) systemic blindness to beyond-log user interests that constrains model performance within platform boundaries. These limitations stem from an over-reliance on shallow interaction statistics and close-looped feedback while neglecting the rich world knowledge about product semantics and cross-domain behavioral patterns that Large Language Models have learned from vast corpora.
  To address these challenges, we introduce ReaSeq, a reasoning-enhanced framework that leverages world knowledge in Large Language Models to address both limitations through explicit and implicit reasoning. Specifically, ReaSeq employs explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning via multi-agent collaboration to distill structured product knowledge into semantically enriched item representations, and latent reasoning via Diffusion Large Language Models to infer plausible beyond-log behaviors. Deployed on Taobao's ranking system serving hundreds of millions of users, ReaSeq achieves substantial gains: >6.0% in IPV and CTR, >2.9% in Orders, and >2.5% in GMV, validating the effectiveness of world-knowledge-enhanced reasoning over purely log-driven approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address search challenges like short, ambiguous queries, noisy listings, and strict production constraints in C2C marketplaces.

Method: The authors fine-tuned embeddings using purchase-driven query-title pairs with role-specific prefixes to model asymmetry and applied Matryoshka Representation Learning for compact and truncation-robust embeddings.

Result: Offline evaluations showed consistent gains in search quality, better handling of marketplace-specific semantics, and improved query relevance. Online A/B testing indicated increased revenue per user and search efficiency while maintaining transaction frequency.

Conclusion: Domain-aware text embeddings significantly enhance search relevance and efficiency at scale, offering a solid base for new search experiences in the LLM era.

Abstract: Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces pose distinct retrieval challenges: short, ambiguous queries; noisy, user-generated listings; and strict production constraints. This paper reports our experiment to build a domain-aware Japanese text-embedding approach to improve the quality of search at Mercari, Japan's largest C2C marketplace. We experimented with fine-tuning on purchase-driven query-title pairs, using role-specific prefixes to model query-item asymmetry. To meet production constraints, we apply Matryoshka Representation Learning to obtain compact, truncation-robust embeddings. Offline evaluation on historical search logs shows consistent gains over a strong generic encoder, with particularly large improvements when replacing PCA compression with Matryoshka truncation. A manual assessment further highlights better handling of proper nouns, marketplace-specific semantics, and term-importance alignment. Additionally, an initial online A/B test demonstrates statistically significant improvements in revenue per user and search-flow efficiency, with transaction frequency maintained. Results show that domain-aware embeddings improve relevance and efficiency at scale and form a practical foundation for richer LLM-era search experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multimodal misinformation detection, domain generalization, and explainability, as current methods are insufficient.

Method: AMPEND-LS integrates LLM reasoning with tools like reverse image search, knowledge graphs, and persuasion analysis, utilizing credibility fusion and an SLM classifier.

Result: AMPEND-LS surpasses existing methods in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AMPEND-LS advances explainable, adaptive detection systems, enhancing misinformation identification and safeguarding online integrity.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online misinformation poses significant risks to public trust, policy, and safety, necessitating reliable automated fake news detection. Existing methods often struggle with multimodal content, domain generalization, and explainability. We propose AMPEND-LS, an agentic multi-persona evidence-grounded framework with LLM-SLM synergy for multimodal fake news detection. AMPEND-LS integrates textual, visual, and contextual signals through a structured reasoning pipeline powered by LLMs, augmented with reverse image search, knowledge graph paths, and persuasion strategy analysis. To improve reliability, we introduce a credibility fusion mechanism combining semantic similarity, domain trustworthiness, and temporal context, and a complementary SLM classifier to mitigate LLM uncertainty and hallucinations. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMPEND-LS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy, F1 score, and robustness. Qualitative case studies further highlight its transparent reasoning and resilience against evolving misinformation. This work advances the development of adaptive, explainable, and evidence-aware systems for safeguarding online information integrity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiGeMine, a hierarchical book genre mining framework that integrates user reviews and authoritative blurbs using semantic alignment and graph-based classification, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and reliability of book genre classification by addressing limitations in existing approaches that ignore the hierarchical genre structure and rely on noisy user reviews.

Method: HiGeMine employs a two-phase approach. Phase one uses zero-shot semantic alignment to filter noisy reviews, and phase two employs a dual-path graph-based classification architecture with pretrained language models and label co-occurrence graphs.

Result: HiGeMine outperformed strong baseline methods in hierarchical genre classification tasks, validated through experiments on a newly curated hierarchical book genre dataset.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective way to leverage structured and unstructured data, offering a robust solution for hierarchical genre analysis in digital library organization and personalization systems.

Abstract: Accurate book genre classification is fundamental to digital library organization, content discovery, and personalized recommendation. Existing approaches typically model genre prediction as a flat, single-label task, ignoring hierarchical genre structure and relying heavily on noisy, subjective user reviews, which often degrade classification reliability. We propose HiGeMine, a two-phase hierarchical genre mining framework that robustly integrates user reviews with authoritative book blurbs. In the first phase, HiGeMine employs a zero-shot semantic alignment strategy to filter reviews, retaining only those semantically consistent with the corresponding blurb, thereby mitigating noise, bias, and irrelevance. In the second phase, we introduce a dual-path, two-level graph-based classification architecture: a coarse-grained Level-1 binary classifier distinguishes fiction from non-fiction, followed by Level-2 multi-label classifiers for fine-grained genre prediction. Inter-genre dependencies are explicitly modeled using a label co-occurrence graph, while contextual representations are derived from pretrained language models applied to the filtered textual content. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we curate a new hierarchical book genre dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGeMine consistently outperformed strong baselines across hierarchical genre classification tasks. The proposed framework offers a principled and effective solution for leveraging both structured and unstructured textual data in hierarchical book genre analysis.

It relates the degenerate scenario to a nondegenerate one using projection and explores the role of the ramification locus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding degenerate quadratic optimization problems, particularly in overparametrized machine learning models with small datasets.

Method: Utilizing tools from algebraic geometry, the study focuses on projections to connect degenerate and nondegenerate optimization problems, examining critical points and introducing techniques for their analysis.

Result: It establishes the connection between degenerate and nondegenerate quadratic optimization via projections, highlights the significance of the ramification locus, and provides techniques for analyzing critical points on projective varieties.

Conclusion: The work unifies concepts from algebraic geometry and machine learning, extending the understanding of Euclidean distance degree to degenerate conditions, particularly relevant to deep learning and overparametrized settings.

Abstract: We study the critical points over an algebraic variety of an optimization problem defined by a quadratic objective that is degenerate. This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater gliders encounter risks in missions involving strong currents and turbulence, requiring robust control mechanisms for safe navigation.

Method: Proposes a fixed-time prescribed performance control framework integrated with a disturbance observer and the iLOS guidance law for precise and robust waypoint tracking.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated improved tracking accuracy, faster convergence, and smoother control effort in numerical simulations compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The control scheme efficiently ensures safety and accuracy in underwater glider navigation under challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Underwater gliders are increasingly deployed in challenging missions - such as hurricane-season observations and long-endurance environmental monitoring - where strong currents and turbulence pose significant risks to navigation safety. To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.

Motivation: Control of nonlinear systems often suffers from challenges like inefficiency and lack of robustness. This paper aims to improve efficiency and accuracy by integrating data-driven modeling (SINDy) with reinforcement learning (TD3).

Method: The authors utilize SINDy for data-driven modeling of system dynamics and combine it with TD3 reinforcement learning. Synthetic rollouts from SINDy are periodically added to the training buffer to enhance learning efficiency.

Result: When applied to a bi-rotor system, the SINDy-TD3 framework demonstrated superior stabilization, trajectory tracking, and robustness compared to standard reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates data-driven dynamics modeling with reinforcement learning to enhance control performance of complex systems, showcasing high potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIRE++, a memory-efficient and fast deep learning-based method for CBCT reconstruction, demonstrating improvements in image quality over baseline alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the research is to address the lower image quality in Cone Beam CT (CBCT) compared to traditional CT imaging methods and the constraints posed by deep learning reconstruction methods in terms of data availability, memory, and inference speed.

Method: The authors propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for CBCT reconstruction. The system incorporates memory optimizations, multiscale reconstruction, and rotational-equivariant features to enhance efficiency and performance. They also developed a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator for training data.

Result: On synthetic data evaluations, LIRE++ delivered a 1 dB improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep-learning baselines. Tested on real clinical CBCT data, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by 10 Hounsfield Units compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LIRE++ is an effective approach for achieving quality improvement in CBCT reconstruction while maintaining fast processing and memory efficiency, making it a promising alternative for clinical applications.

Abstract: Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is an important imaging modality nowadays, however lower image quality of CBCT compared to more conventional Computed Tomography (CT) remains a limiting factor in CBCT applications. Deep learning reconstruction methods are a promising alternative to classical analytical and iterative reconstruction methods, but applying such methods to CBCT is often difficult due to the lack of ground truth data, memory limitations and the need for fast inference at clinically-relevant resolutions. In this work we propose LIRE++, an end-to-end rotationally-equivariant multiscale learned invertible primal-dual scheme for fast and memory-efficient CBCT reconstruction. Memory optimizations and multiscale reconstruction allow for fast training and inference, while rotational equivariance improves parameter efficiency. LIRE++ was trained on simulated projection data from a fast quasi-Monte Carlo CBCT projection simulator that we developed as well. Evaluated on synthetic data, LIRE++ gave an average improvement of 1 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over alternative deep learning baselines. On real clinical data, LIRE++ improved the average Mean Absolute Error between the reconstruction and the corresponding planning CT by 10 Hounsfield Units with respect to current proprietary state-of-the-art hybrid deep-learning/iterative method.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty quantification method based on Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO) for improving the reliability and sensitivity of neural network-driven point-of-care diagnostic systems, demonstrated on a Lyme disease diagnostic platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based diagnostic systems are prone to errors, posing significant risks in clinical applications, especially in remote or resource-limited settings. There is a need for techniques to identify and exclude incorrect predictions autonomously.

Method: The study employed a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification mechanism integrated into a computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform for Lyme disease diagnosis. This platform combines a paper-based test, handheld optical reader, and neural inference algorithm.

Result: The uncertainty quantification approach excluded predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7% in blinded testing on new patient samples.

Conclusion: MCDO-based uncertainty quantification enhances the robustness and sensitivity of point-of-care diagnostic systems, improving clinical reliability even without access to ground truth patient data.

Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.

TL;DR: The paper investigates if machine learning models can identify chemists who made specific molecules using molecular fingerprints and whether this influences bioactivity predictions. Results show potential biases based on chemist intent, not pure chemical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if machine learning models exploit chemist intent from data, instead of learning true structure-activity relationships in molecular research.

Method: Linked molecular data to publication authors, trained a classifier to predict authors based on molecular fingerprints, and evaluated bioactivity using only author-related signals.

Result: The author-only model achieved predictive power similar to baseline methods using structure, indicating reliance on chemist intent rather than pure chemical knowledge.

Conclusion: Machine learning models may inadvertently capture chemist intent, leading to biased bioactivity predictions. Proposes splitting methods and dataset practices to mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Can machine learning models identify which chemist made a molecule from structure alone? If so, models trained on literature data may exploit chemist intent rather than learning causal structure-activity relationships. We test this by linking CHEMBL assays to publication authors and training a 1,815-class classifier to predict authors from molecular fingerprints, achieving 60% top-5 accuracy under scaffold-based splitting. We then train an activity model that receives only a protein identifier and an author-probability vector derived from structure, with no direct access to molecular descriptors. This author-only model achieves predictive power comparable to a simple baseline that has access to structure. This reveals a "Clever Hans" failure mode: models can predict bioactivity largely by inferring chemist goals and favorite targets without requiring a lab-independent understanding of chemistry. We analyze the sources of this leakage, propose author-disjoint splits, and recommend dataset practices to decouple chemist intent from biological outcomes.

### [262] [AutoBaxBuilder: Bootstrapping Code Security Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21132)
*Tobias von Arx,Niels Mündler,Mark Vero,Maximilian Baader,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoBaxBuilder, a framework to automate the creation of security benchmarks for LLM-generated code, overcoming limitations of manual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous security benchmark creation relied heavily on manual effort from experts, and faced issues like data contamination, task expansion difficulty, and challenges for advanced LLMs.

Method: AutoBaxBuilder leverages LLMs for constructing security benchmarks through a pipeline with plausibility checks, functionality testing, and security exploits.

Result: AutoBaxBuilder successfully generated new tasks (released as AutoBaxBench) efficiently in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10, showing comparable quality to expert-constructed tasks.

Conclusion: Automating security benchmark creation using AutoBaxBuilder provides a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution to assess and improve LLM security capabilities.

Abstract: As LLMs see wide adoption in software engineering, the reliable assessment of the correctness and security of LLM-generated code is crucial. Notably, prior work has demonstrated that security is often overlooked, exposing that LLMs are prone to generating code with security vulnerabilities. These insights were enabled by specialized benchmarks, crafted through significant manual effort by security experts. However, relying on manually-crafted benchmarks is insufficient in the long term, because benchmarks (i) naturally end up contaminating training data, (ii) must extend to new tasks to provide a more complete picture, and (iii) must increase in difficulty to challenge more capable LLMs. In this work, we address these challenges and present AutoBaxBuilder, a framework that generates tasks and tests for code security benchmarking from scratch. We introduce a robust pipeline with fine-grained plausibility checks, leveraging the code understanding capabilities of LLMs to construct functionality tests and end-to-end security-probing exploits. To confirm the quality of the generated benchmark, we conduct both a qualitative analysis and perform quantitative experiments, comparing it against tasks constructed by human experts. We use AutoBaxBuilder to construct entirely new tasks and release them to the public as AutoBaxBench, together with a thorough evaluation of the security capabilities of LLMs on these tasks. We find that a new task can be generated in under 2 hours, costing less than USD 10.

### [263] [SoK: Speedy Secure Finality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20715)
*Yash Saraswat,Abhimanyu Nag*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Ethereum's transaction finality has a delay of around 15 minutes, exposing it to attacks and inefficiencies. This paper reviews protocols aimed at reducing this latency, known as Speedy Secure Finality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve Ethereum's long transaction finality latency and address vulnerabilities, such as reorganization attacks and MEV extraction.

Method: Survey of fast finality protocol designs, exploring theoretical models and analyzing bottlenecks, specifically focusing on the 3-slot finality protocol as an optimized solution.

Result: Identified theoretical and engineering concepts for reducing transaction finality latency while maintaining security and scalability in large validator networks.

Conclusion: The 3-slot finality protocol provides a balanced approach for minimizing latency without compromising Ethereum's security or network efficiency.

Abstract: While Ethereum has successfully achieved dynamic availability together with safety, a fundamental delay remains between transaction execution and immutable finality. In Ethereum's current Gasper protocol, this latency is on the order of 15 minutes, exposing the network to ex ante reorganization attacks, enabling MEV extraction, and limiting the efficiency of economic settlement. These limitations have motivated a growing body of work on Speedy Secure Finality (SSF), which aims to minimize confirmation latency without weakening formal security guarantees.
  This paper surveys the state of the art in fast finality protocol design. We introduce the core theoretical primitives underlying this space, including reorganization resilience and the generalized sleepy model, and trace their development from Goldfish to RLMD-GHOST. We then analyze the communication and aggregation bottlenecks faced by single-slot finality protocols in large validator settings. Finally, we survey the 3-slot finality (3SF) protocol as a practical synthesis that balances fast finality with the engineering constraints of the Ethereum network.

*Savvy Sharma,George Petrovic,Sarthak Kaushik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces zkFL-Health, a framework combining federated learning, zero-knowledge proofs, and trusted environments for secure, verifiable medical AI training without compromising privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI requires diverse, large datasets, but privacy and governance constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning mitigates risks, yet privacy leakage and aggregator trust issues remain challenges.

Method: The framework zkFL-Health combines federated learning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). It uses ZKPs for verifiably correct collaborative training while maintaining privacy and TEEs to secure aggregation rules.

Result: zkFL-Health ensures strong privacy and trust while supporting multi-institutional collaborations. Clients train locally, commit updates, and aggregators perform operations securely within TEEs and present verifiable proofs. Blockchain records commitments for transparency.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture addresses key privacy and trust challenges in federated healthcare AI, making it suitable for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Healthcare AI needs large, diverse datasets, yet strict privacy and governance constraints prevent raw data sharing across institutions. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by training where data reside and exchanging only model updates, but practical deployments still face two core risks: (1) privacy leakage via gradients or updates (membership inference, gradient inversion) and (2) trust in the aggregator, a single point of failure that can drop, alter, or inject contributions undetected. We present zkFL-Health, an architecture that combines FL with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deliver privacy-preserving, verifiably correct collaborative training for medical AI. Clients locally train and commit their updates; the aggregator operates within a TEE to compute the global update and produces a succinct ZK proof (via Halo2/Nova) that it used exactly the committed inputs and the correct aggregation rule, without revealing any client update to the host. Verifier nodes validate the proof and record cryptographic commitments on-chain, providing an immutable audit trail and removing the need to trust any single party. We outline system and threat models tailored to healthcare, the zkFL-Health protocol, security/privacy guarantees, and a performance evaluation plan spanning accuracy, privacy risk, latency, and cost. This framework enables multi-institutional medical AI with strong confidentiality, integrity, and auditability, key properties for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance.

*Yifan Huang,Xiaojun Jia,Wenbo Guo,Yuqiang Sun,Yihao Huang,Chong Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPELL, a framework for testing vulnerabilities in security alignment of LLMs for malicious code generation. It achieves significant success rates in generating harmful software across multiple LLMs, highlighting major security concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of research on malicious code generation as a primary target in LLM jailbreaking, given concerns about misuse in software development.

Method: The authors propose SPELL, a framework that uses a time-division selection strategy to construct jailbreaking prompts by combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Result: SPELL was tested on three advanced LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, Qwen2.5-Coder), achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively. The outputs were verified as malicious by advanced detection systems, demonstrating a 73%+ success rate in real-world AI development tools.

Conclusion: The work reveals significant security vulnerabilities in current LLMs for malicious code generation and offers insights to improve AI safety alignment in code generation tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized software development through AI-assisted coding tools, enabling developers with limited programming expertise to create sophisticated applications. However, this accessibility extends to malicious actors who may exploit these powerful tools to generate harmful software. Existing jailbreaking research primarily focuses on general attack scenarios against LLMs, with limited exploration of malicious code generation as a jailbreak target. To address this gap, we propose SPELL, a comprehensive testing framework specifically designed to evaluate the weakness of security alignment in malicious code generation. Our framework employs a time-division selection strategy that systematically constructs jailbreaking prompts by intelligently combining sentences from a prior knowledge dataset, balancing exploration of novel attack patterns with exploitation of successful techniques. Extensive evaluation across three advanced code models (GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5, and Qwen2.5-Coder) demonstrates SPELL's effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 83.75%, 19.38%, and 68.12% respectively across eight malicious code categories. The generated prompts successfully produce malicious code in real-world AI development tools such as Cursor, with outputs confirmed as malicious by state-of-the-art detection systems at rates exceeding 73%. These findings reveal significant security gaps in current LLM implementations and provide valuable insights for improving AI safety alignment in code generation applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework for red-teaming LLMs, improving vulnerability detection over manual testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and comprehensiveness challenges in current red-teaming practices for LLM security and alignment.

Method: Proposes meta-prompting attack synthesis, multi-modal detection, and standardized evaluation protocols for six major threat categories.

Result: Achieved $3.9x$ better vulnerability detection than manual testing, uncovering 47 vulnerabilities with 89% detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enhances scalable, systematic AI safety evaluations, contributing to more secure and trustworthy LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, ensuring their security and alignment has become a critical challenge. Existing red-teaming practices depend heavily on manual testing, which limits scalability and fails to comprehensively cover the vast space of potential adversarial behaviors. This paper introduces an automated red-teaming framework that systematically generates, executes, and evaluates adversarial prompts to uncover security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Our framework integrates meta-prompting-based attack synthesis, multi-modal vulnerability detection, and standardized evaluation protocols spanning six major threat categories -- reward hacking, deceptive alignment, data exfiltration, sandbagging, inappropriate tool use, and chain-of-thought manipulation. Experiments on the GPT-OSS-20B model reveal 47 distinct vulnerabilities, including 21 high-severity and 12 novel attack patterns, achieving a $3.9\times$ improvement in vulnerability discovery rate over manual expert testing while maintaining 89\% detection accuracy. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in enabling scalable, systematic, and reproducible AI safety evaluations. By providing actionable insights for improving alignment robustness, this work advances the state of automated LLM red-teaming and contributes to the broader goal of building secure and trustworthy AI systems.

*Omer Gazit,Yael Itzhakev,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents the first physical attack on RF-based drone detection systems by creating perturbation waveforms that reduce detection of specific drones in real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in current RF-based drone detectors when faced with over-the-air (OTA) attacks, highlighting difficulties in converting digital perturbations into transmittable signals.

Method: It proposes using optimized class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms transmitted alongside legitimate communications to interfere with targeted drone detection.

Result: The proposed I/Q perturbations were tested on four drone types, demonstrating reliable reduction in target drone detection and compatibility with standard RF chains.

Conclusion: Modest, structured I/Q perturbations can physically attack RF-based drone detectors while maintaining the detection of legitimate drones. This showcases vulnerabilities in existing systems and highlights potential risks.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) based systems are increasingly used to detect drones by analyzing their RF signal patterns, converting them into spectrogram images which are processed by object detection models. Existing RF attacks against image based models alter digital features, making over-the-air (OTA) implementation difficult due to the challenge of converting digital perturbations to transmittable waveforms that may introduce synchronization errors and interference, and encounter hardware limitations. We present the first physical attack on RF image based drone detectors, optimizing class-specific universal complex baseband (I/Q) perturbation waveforms that are transmitted alongside legitimate communications. We evaluated the attack using RF recordings and OTA experiments with four types of drones. Our results show that modest, structured I/Q perturbations are compatible with standard RF chains and reliably reduce target drone detection while preserving detection of legitimate drones.

*Jakir Hossain,Gurvinder Singh,Lukasz Ziarek,Ahmet Erdem Sarıyüce*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset with high-quality Android Function Call Graphs (FCGs) to improve Android malware classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing FCG datasets for Android malware classification, such as outdated, redundant, or small-scale datasets that fail to reflect real-world diversity.

Method: Developed BCG, a high-quality dataset with large and unique FCGs from Android APKs, including benign and malicious samples. Provided graph-level features for classification benchmarking.

Result: BCG dataset showed better diversity and representativeness for real-world malware detection. It outperformed existing datasets in enhancing graph-based malware detection methods.

Conclusion: BCG fills the gap in Android-specific malware detection datasets with a high-quality, diverse resource, providing a reliable foundation for advancing malware classification research.

Abstract: Function call graphs (FCGs) have emerged as a powerful abstraction for malware detection, capturing the behavioral structure of applications beyond surface-level signatures. Their utility in traditional program analysis has been well established, enabling effective classification and analysis of malicious software. In the mobile domain, especially in the Android ecosystem, FCG-based malware classification is particularly critical due to the platform's widespread adoption and the complex, component-based structure of Android apps. However, progress in this direction is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality Android-specific FCG datasets. Existing datasets are often outdated, dominated by small or redundant graphs resulting from app repackaging, and fail to reflect the diversity of real-world malware. These limitations lead to overfitting and unreliable evaluation of graph-based classification methods. To address this gap, we introduce Better Call Graphs (BCG), a comprehensive dataset of large and unique FCGs extracted from recent Android application packages (APKs). BCG includes both benign and malicious samples spanning various families and types, along with graph-level features for each APK. Through extensive experiments using baseline classifiers, we demonstrate the necessity and value of BCG compared to existing datasets. BCG is publicly available at https://erdemub.github.io/BCG-dataset.

*Caio Lins Peixoto,Daniel Csillag,Bernardo F. P. da Costa,Yuri F. Saporito*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gradient-free optimization method for infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, addressing tractability issues and enabling provable convergence, particularly for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimization methods in infinite-dimensional spaces rely on finite-dimensional gradient descent on parametric representations like neural networks. However, directly performing optimization within function spaces offers theoretical guarantees and faster convergence but is typically hindered by challenges in computing infinite-dimensional gradients.

Method: The proposed framework avoids reliance on infinite-dimensional gradients by utilizing directional derivatives and a pre-basis (a dense, linearly-independent set) for Hilbert spaces. Forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation is used for efficiently computing directional derivatives.

Result: The method resolves computational issues by providing an accessible approach for functional optimization in Hilbert spaces. It is successfully applied to solving PDEs using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), achieving provable convergence.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel and practical framework for optimization in Hilbert spaces, extending its applicability to problems like PDEs through efficient use of directional derivatives and pre-basis representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations à la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.

*Ian Bounos,Pablo Groisman,Mariela Sued,Esteban Tabak*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper develops a methodology to extract $d$ invariant features that predict a response $Y$ while eliminating confounding effects from variables $Z$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of predicting a response variable $Y$ without interference from confounders $Z$ that may distort the relationship between features $X$ and $Y$.

Method: The method involves penalizing statistical dependence between extracted features $W$ and $Z$ (conditioned on $Y$), using optimal transport solutions. It includes a linear feature extraction process based on eigenvectors, with extensions to non-linear cases.

Result: A linear feature extractor in the Gaussian case is derived with a closed-form solution. It remains effective for general scenarios within certain conditions, allowing confounder surrogates.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively eliminates biases from confounders, with theoretical guarantees in Gaussian scenarios and practical applicability to broader cases.

Abstract: A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $Σ_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.

*Alexandra Carpentier,Nicolas Verzelen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper addresses ranking experts based on their answer's quality using crowd-sourcing models and isotonic constraints, exploring optimal algorithms without computational-statistical gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to rank experts based on answer correctness, considering statistical optimality and computational feasibility in the context of complex data structures like isotonic matrices with unknown permutations.

Method: The authors investigate isotonic models, begin with simpler sub-problems like sub-matrix detection, and utilize tools such as low-degree polynomial methods to address computational complexity.

Result: They show no computational-statistical gap for the isotonic ranking problem and provide insights by referencing related sub-problems and proof techniques.

Conclusion: The research bridges theory and practical algorithmic challenges, offering a unified understanding of ranking in isotonic models while disproving computational-statistical complexity separations.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking $n$ experts according to their abilities, based on the correctness of their answers to $d$ questions. This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $π^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{π^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{π^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $π^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $λ\mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem.

*Haoyang Li,Xuyi Zhuang,Azmat Adnan,Ye Ni,Wei Rao,Shreyas Gopal,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenTSE, a two-stage generative language model method for target speaker extraction, which improves output fidelity and speech quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance generative modeling for Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) by improving generalization and producing high-fidelity speech.

Method: The proposed GenTSE employs a two-stage decoder-only Language Model: Stage-1 predicts semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates acoustic tokens. It uses continuous embeddings, Frozen-LM Conditioning to reduce exposure bias, and DPO for aligning outputs with human perception.

Result: The system outperforms previous approaches, showcasing better speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency on the Libri2Mix dataset.

Conclusion: Separating semantics and acoustics, combined with their training strategies, proves effective for high-quality and perceptual alignment in generative TSE.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based generative modeling has emerged as a promising direction for TSE, offering potential for improved generalization and high-fidelity speech. We present GenTSE, a two-stage decoder-only generative LM approach for TSE: Stage-1 predicts coarse semantic tokens, and Stage-2 generates fine acoustic tokens. Separating semantics and acoustics stabilizes decoding and yields more faithful, content-aligned target speech. Both stages use continuous SSL or codec embeddings, offering richer context than discretized-prompt methods. To reduce exposure bias, we employ a Frozen-LM Conditioning training strategy that conditions the LMs on predicted tokens from earlier checkpoints to reduce the gap between teacher-forcing training and autoregressive inference. We further employ DPO to better align outputs with human perceptual preferences. Experiments on Libri2Mix show that GenTSE surpasses previous LM-based systems in speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker consistency.
