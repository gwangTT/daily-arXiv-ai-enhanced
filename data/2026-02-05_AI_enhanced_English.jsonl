This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations.

To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness.

Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric.

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation.

Given such trends, design space exploration (DSE) at early stages is critical to ensure agile development towards optimal performance and cost. Industry-grade EDA tools directly take in RTL code and report accurate results, but do not perform DSE. Recent works have attempted to explore the design space via simulation. However, most of these works are domain-specific and constrain the space that users are allowed to explore, offering limited flexibility between technologies, architecture, and applications. Moreover, they often demand high domain expertise to ensure high accuracy. To enable simulation that is agnostic to technology, architecture, and application at any granularity, we introduce Architecture-Graph (Agraph), a graph that unifies the system representation surrounding any arbitrary application, software, architecture, and circuit. Such a unified representation distinguishes Agraph from prior works, which focus on a single stack, allowing users to freely explore the design space across system stacks. To fully unleash the potential of Agraph, we further present Archx, a framework that implements Agraph. Archx is user-friendly in two ways. First, Archx has an easy-to-use programming interface to automatically generate and sweep design points under user constraints, boosting the programmability. Second, Archx adopts scope-based metric retrieval to analyze and understand each design point at any user-preferred hierarchy, enhancing the explainability.

In this paper, we propose a robust non-linear PCA framework that unifies the interpretability of PCA with the flexibility of neural networks. Our method parametrizes variable transformations via neural networks, optimized using Evolution Strategies (ES) to handle the non-differentiability of eigendecomposition.

To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core.

Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies.

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning.

A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance.

For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory.

Constraints from inference latency in scalable serving and fine-tuning cost in edge or rapid-deployment settings make the choice of which layers to fine-tune unavoidable. Yet current practice typically applies PEFT uniformly across all layers, with limited understanding or leverage of layer selection. This paper develops a unified projected residual view of PEFT on top of a frozen base model. Under a local quadratic approximation, layerwise adaptation is governed by three quantities: (i) the projected residual norm (resnorm), which measures how much correctable bias a layer can capture; (ii) the activation energy, which determines feature conditioning; and (iii) layer coupling, which quantifies how strongly residuals interact across layers. We show that, for squared loss and linear adapters, the resnorm equals a normalized gradient norm, activation energy controls ill-conditioning and noise amplification, and weak coupling yields approximately additive layerwise contributions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Layer Card, a reusable diagnostic that summarizes residual signal strength, compute cost, and performance for each layer of a given model. With an identical model and LoRA configuration, Layer Card-guided placement refines the choice of adapted layers to flexibly prioritize different objectives, such as maximizing performance or reducing fine-tuning cost.

Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost.

Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning.

Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples.

However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment.

PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines.

To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding.

To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a novel framework, PLANET, to address issues in Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs), such as insufficient modality interaction and alignment.", "motivation": "The motivation behind the paper is to extend the potential of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) to Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs), which remain unexplored, enabling richer multimodal information utilization and addressing broader downstream tasks.", "method": "The proposed methodology, PLANET, adopts a Divide-and-Conquer strategy with two key components: Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) for better modality interaction and Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) for improved global modality alignment.", "result": "Extensive experiments show that PLANET significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines in graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks.", "conclusion": "PLANET effectively resolves the limitations in existing MGFMs, particularly by improving cross-modality interaction and alignment, proving its capability for broader multimodal applications."}}

In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation.

In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes.

These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces URSA-GAN, a generative framework addressing mismatches in noise and channel conditions to enhance ASR and SE.", "motivation": "Existing models for ASR and SE struggle with domain shifts, particularly under unseen noise and channel distortions.", "method": "Proposes URSA-GAN, using a dual-embedding architecture with noise/channel encoders and a GAN-based speech generator to ensure domain alignment and phonetic integrity.", "result": "URSA-GAN yields relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics under challenging conditions.", "conclusion": "URSA-GAN effectively addresses domain mismatches, enhancing robustness and generalization for ASR and SE models in diverse scenarios."}}

Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm.

To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings.

To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework.

We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability.
