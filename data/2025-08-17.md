*Alexandru-Andrei Avram,Adrian Groza,Alexandru Lecu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent system leveraging different methods like logistic regression, named entity recognition, LLM-based coherence checking, and web scraping for effective disinformation detection, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of disinformation poses critical challenges to the reliability of information on digital platforms. This paper aims to tackle this issue with an advanced detection system.

Method: The multi-agent system integrates four distinct agents with specific roles: logistic regression for machine learning, Wikipedia knowledge checking through named entity recognition, coherence detection via LLM prompt engineering, and web-scraped data analysis for relational triplets. The agents employ Model Context Protocol (MCP) for unified learning and operation.

Result: The system achieved an impressive 95.3% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.964, significantly surpassing traditional methods and individual agents in performance.

Conclusion: A modular, multi-agent approach combining both mathematical and algorithm-driven mechanisms produces scalable and accurate disinformation detection while retaining interpretability of decisions.

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

### [5] [Improving and Evaluating Open Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10152)
*Doaa Allabadi,Kyle Bradbury,Jordan M. Malof*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines Deep Research Agents (DRAs), proposing improvements to existing systems using the BC-Small benchmark that result in a 10% success rate, a major step forward for both open and closed-source systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more effective evaluation and improved models for Deep Research Agents, especially in open-source formats, comparing them to proprietary systems.

Method: The method included adapting the BrowseComp benchmark into a computationally manageable format (BC-Small) and proposing improvements to the open-source ODR model. The updated model (ODR+) was compared with proprietary systems from Anthropic and Google.

Result: ODR+, the improved open-source system, achieved a state-of-the-art success rate of 10% on the BC-Small benchmark compared to 0% by other open or closed-source systems.

Conclusion: Strategic enhancements to ODR result in progress toward better-performing DRAs, marking a step forward in both open-source and closed-source research benchmarks.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

### [6] [Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of Large Reasoning Models via Small-Scale Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10164)
*Bin Hong,Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO) to reduce long Chain-of-Thought reasoning outputs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) efficiently, achieving significant length reduction while maintaining reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing reasoning effectiveness and efficiency in LRMs is challenging due to the high computational cost and potential overthinking caused by long Chain-of-Thought outputs.

Method: The paper analyzes generation paths and convergence behaviors under a Bradley-Terry loss framework, using LCPO to optimize length preferences through implicit reward balancing in training.

Result: LCPO reduces the average output length by over 50% across multiple benchmarks without compromising reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Computationally efficient methods like LCPO effectively guide LRMs toward more efficient reasoning, paving the way for better optimization of performance and resource usage.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep neural network framework for predictive maintenance in railway track circuits, achieving high accuracy and early anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track circuits are prone to failures due to subtle anomalies that standard methods struggle to detect early, leading to disruptions and financial losses.

Method: The research employs deep neural networks to classify anomalies and utilizes conformal prediction for confidence estimates, achieving compliance with ISO-17359 standards.

Result: The framework validated on real cases achieved 99.31% accuracy, detecting anomalies within 1% of onset and providing high confidence levels across anomaly classes.

Conclusion: This scalable and adaptable approach enhances railway system reliability globally by enabling early and accurate anomaly detection.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

*Stepan Kulibaba,Artem Dzhalilov,Roman Pakhomov,Oleg Svidchenko,Alexander Gasnikov,Aleksei Shpilman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KompeteAI revolutionizes AutoML with innovative solution space exploration and efficient execution, outperforming top benchmarks and redefining pipeline evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two major limitations in current LLM-based AutoML systems: constrained exploration strategies and execution bottlenecks.

Method: KompeteAI introduces dynamic solution exploration using a merging stage to combine ideas, Retrieval-Augmented Generation from external sources, a predictive scoring model, and accelerated debugging methods.

Result: KompeteAI speeds up pipeline evaluation by 6.9 times and outperforms top AutoML systems (RD-agent, AIDE, Ml-Master) by an average of 3% on MLE-Bench.

Conclusion: KompeteAI sets a new standard in AutoML frameworks, delivering faster evaluations and higher performance, validated on existing and proposed benchmarks like Kompete-bench.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

*Mark Zilberman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces how the concept of entropic potential from physics can improve uncertainty quantification, decision-making, and interpretability in AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the concept of entropic potential, originally from physics, for use in artificial intelligence, specifically to improve uncertainty modeling and decision-making.

Method: The authors formalize both classical and AI-specific definitions of entropic potential, emphasizing its connection to counterfactuals and uncertainties, and provide examples in various AI domains like reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference.

Result: The framework's applications in policy evaluation, intrinsic rewards, explainable AI, and anomaly detection demonstrate its potential to unify uncertainty modeling across different AI systems.

Conclusion: The entropic potential framework is a theoretically grounded and versatile tool that links thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning, presenting new avenues to manage uncertainty in AI.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

### [10] [Why Cannot Large Language Models Ever Make True Correct Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10265)
*Jingde Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that LLMs cannot achieve true understanding or reasoning due to fundamental limitations in their operating principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the claims that large language models like ChatGPT possess understanding and reasoning abilities.

Method: The paper attempts to explain its position by outlining the fundamental limitations in the working principles of LLMs.

Result: No empirical results are mentioned; the argument centers around a theoretical critique of LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs are inherently incapable of true reasoning or understanding, as per the author's critique of their operational principles.

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language
models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are
trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The
present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

### [11] [Promoting Efficient Reasoning with Verifiable Stepwise Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10293)
*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and introduces a reward mechanism to encourage effective reasoning steps and penalize ineffective ones, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs excel in complex reasoning tasks but often face inefficiencies due to overthinking, which results in unnecessary computational effort on simple problems.

Method: The authors propose a rule-based Verifiable Stepwise Reward Mechanism (VSRM) that evaluates intermediate reasoning steps for rewards or penalties, integrated with PPO and Reinforce++ for practical implementation.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate reduced output length and maintained reasoning performance, effectively balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The VSRM method alleviates overthinking in LRMs by suppressing ineffective reasoning steps, and code will be made publicly available after formal acceptance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the top-performing solutions for the META CRAG-MM challenge, focusing on multi-modal multi-turn question answering tasks, leveraging a combination of vision LLM, curriculum learning, and external web knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of building a multi-modal multi-turn question-answering system that synthesizes knowledge from multiple sources and requires context understanding.

Method: The authors used a vision large language model with knowledge distillation from GPT-4.1 and curriculum learning for Task 1, and integrated web search APIs for external knowledge in Tasks 2 and 3.

Result: The approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a 52.38% lead, and 3rd place in Task 3, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The integration of vision-based LLMs with curriculum learning, reinforcement learning, and external data sources proved highly effective for handling complex and multi-modal question-answering tasks.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of

### [13] [Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation: A Joint Constraint Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10340)
*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods, HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G, to improve coordination in policy updates for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome inefficiencies in HATRPO caused by assigning the same KL divergence threshold to all agents in heterogeneous multi-agent settings, which leads to slow and suboptimal learning.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: HATRPO-W, a KKT-based method optimizing KL threshold assignments globally, and HATRPO-G, a greedy algorithm prioritizing agents by improvement-to-divergence ratio.

Result: Both methods outperform standard HATRPO in MARL benchmarks, with over 22.5% improvement in final performance. HATRPO-W also shows more stable learning dynamics due to reduced variance.

Conclusion: The proposed threshold allocation strategies enable more flexible, faster, and effective learning in MARL, making them valuable extensions to HATRPO for diverse environments.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

*Mengtao Zhou,Sifan Wu,Huan Zhang,Qi Sima,Bang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) in imaginative reasoning using the "Turtle Soup" game framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dynamic, exploratory benchmarks in evaluating the imaginative reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: A new framework is introduced, including the bilingual TurtleSoup-Bench for puzzles, Mosaic-Agent for evaluation, and a multi-dimensional protocol measuring logic, details, and conclusions.

Result: Experiments reveal significant limitations in LLMs' imaginative reasoning compared to humans, along with common failure patterns.

Conclusion: The study highlights gaps in LLMs' reasoning ability, provides a new evaluation framework, and fosters understanding of their exploratory performance.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [15] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LeanRAG, a framework for retrieval-augmented generation that addresses inefficiencies in organizing and retrieving knowledge from knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current RAG methods, including the disconnection among high-level semantic summaries and inefficient retrieval processes.

Method: The paper proposes LeanRAG, featuring a semantic aggregation algorithm for creating entity clusters and a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy to navigate the knowledge graph effectively.

Result: The LeanRAG framework outperforms existing methods on QA benchmarks across multiple domains, improving response quality while reducing retrieval redundancy by 46%.

Conclusion: LeanRAG provides an efficient and effective solution for improving grounding in large language models through structured and navigable knowledge graphs, demonstrating superior performance and reduced overhead.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

### [16] [HiRef: Leveraging Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10425)
*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiRef, a model that integrates medical ontologies and real-world EHR patterns for better medication recommendation, addressing the challenges of missing data and unseen codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication recommendation is challenging due to sparse and incomplete EHR data, making it difficult for traditional models to generalize under missing or novel conditions.

Method: HiRef employs a unified framework combining hierarchical medical ontologies (embedded in hyperbolic space) and refined co-occurrence patterns from EHR data. A sparse regularization scheme suppresses spurious connections in the EHR graph.

Result: HiRef demonstrates strong performance on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, maintaining high accuracy even when dealing with simulated unseen medical codes.

Conclusion: HiRef improves generalizability and robustness in medication recommendation by combining curated medical knowledge with refined EHR data, thus addressing the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-Food-100K, a public dataset of 100,000 multimodal food images with traceable provenance, aiming to improve food intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a high-quality, traceable dataset for multimodal food intelligence research, aiding in tasks like nutritional prediction while supporting community contributors.

Method: A subset of 100,000 samples was curated from a larger 1.2 million-item dataset using the Codatta contribution model, combining community contributions, AI-assisted quality checks, and secure ledger traceability.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models on this dataset enhanced their performance on nutrition prediction tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The dataset demonstrates utility in improving model predictions and is openly available for research, while contributors benefit from potential commercial opportunities and revenue sharing.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

TL;DR: The paper presents We-Math 2.0, a system designed to improve mathematical reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through a structured knowledge system, dataset modeling, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based training. It demonstrates promising outcomes in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, and prior research often overlooks comprehensive knowledge design and data modeling tailored to the model's needs.

Method: We-Math 2.0 combines a structured mathematical knowledge hierarchy, advanced dataset design (MathBook-Standard and MathBook-Pro), RL-based training (MathBook-RL), and a new evaluation benchmark (MathBookEval).

Result: MathBook-RL achieves competitive or superior performance on existing benchmarks and shows strong generalization on the MathBookEval benchmark.

Conclusion: By integrating knowledge-driven design, challenging datasets, and advanced training paradigms, We-Math 2.0 enhances the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs, addressing overlooked aspects in current research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

### [19] [FIRESPARQL: A LLM-based Framework for SPARQL Query Generation over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10467)
*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRESPARQL, a framework to improve Large Language Models' ability to generate accurate SPARQL queries for scholarly knowledge graphs. It addresses structural and semantic errors through fine-tuning and optional retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of question answering over scholarly knowledge graphs due to the complexity of their structure and the difficulties of generating accurate SPARQL queries using large language models.

Method: The authors propose FIRESPARQL, a modular framework integrating fine-tuned LLMs, optional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a SPARQL query correction layer. They evaluate the framework's performance on various configurations and metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and RelaxedEM.

Result: The fine-tuning configuration achieved the best performance, with 0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the test set.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs within the FIRESPARQL framework significantly improves SPARQL query generation accuracy for scholarly knowledge graphs, providing an effective solution to address structural and semantic issues.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

*Ivan Khai Ze Lim,Ningyi Liao,Yiming Yang,Gerald Wei Yong Yip,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEQ-GPT, a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable complex spatial searches involving multiple locations with user-friendly natural language interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial services fall short in facilitating complex location-based searches, prompting the need to enable richer and more dynamic querying capabilities.

Method: The study proposes SEQ-GPT, which integrates LLMs to improve spatial queries via natural-language processing, user interaction for query refinement, and an LLM adaptation pipeline to align language with spatial data.

Result: SEQ-GPT demonstrates the ability to handle complex spatial search tasks with natural language, providing interactive user feedback and adjusting queries dynamically in realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT expands the scope of spatial search by leveraging LLMs, improving user interaction and enabling complex task performance beyond traditional systems.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DxDirector-7B, an AI model designed to drive the full clinical diagnosis process from ambiguous complaints, minimizing physician involvement and enhancing diagnostic efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of AI being confined to an assistant role in clinical diagnosis, thus restricting its ability to reduce physician workload and improve diagnostic efficiency.

Method: DxDirector-7B, a large language model with advanced deep thinking capabilities, was developed to take charge of full-process clinical diagnosis, supported by a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses.

Result: In evaluations, DxDirector-7B achieved superior diagnostic accuracy, reduced physician workload, and demonstrated efficacy across complex cases, clinical departments, and tasks compared to existing medical and general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B represents a paradigm shift by positioning AI as the primary driver of diagnostic processes, paving the way for efficient, accurate solutions and reducing physician dependency.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PASS, a multimodal framework for Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning that improves interpretability, multimodal integration, efficiency, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems have limitations such as black-box reasoning, poor multimodal capability, and rigid inefficient workflows, especially in critical tasks like healthcare.

Method: PASS uses probabilistic sampling over multi-tool graphs with probability-annotated paths, integrates a task-conditioned distribution, employs personalized memory, and uses multi-stage training including cost-aware reinforcement learning.

Result: PASS demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, AUC, and computational efficiency across benchmarks, including a new benchmark (CAB-E) designed for safety-critical CXR reasoning.

Conclusion: PASS represents a paradigm shift towards safer, interpretable, and adaptive multimodal systems for medical reasoning.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

### [23] [Diversity First, Quality Later: A Two-Stage Assumption for Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10530)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates language model alignment with human preferences, emphasizing challenges in using static vs. on-policy preference data, and proposes a framework to clarify alignment stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving alignment methods for language models to better reflect human preferences, ensuring more reliable AI systems.

Method: The study introduces the "alignment stage assumption," dividing the alignment process into two stages: preference injection (benefiting from diverse data) and preference fine-tuning (favoring high-quality data). It also creates an algorithm to identify boundaries between these stages.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of on-policy and static preference data varies across models, with systematic differences observed. The alignment stage assumption is supported by theoretical and empirical analysis over 5 models and 2 alignment methods.

Conclusion: Characterizing alignment stages helps refine the alignment process, balancing data diversity and quality to optimize language models' adherence to human preferences.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

TL;DR: This paper proposes the ComMCS method to improve reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing variance in Monte Carlo estimations, achieving better results in complex tasks without additional inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges in reasoning capabilities of LLMs, specifically in mathematics, and overcoming the limitations caused by high estimation error from limited Monte Carlo samples.

Method: The ComMCS method constructs an unbiased estimator by linearly combining Monte Carlo estimators from the current and subsequent steps. This approach reduces variance while maintaining unbiased estimation without adding inference cost.

Result: Experimental results on MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks show that ComMCS outperforms both regression-based methods and non-variance-reduced baselines, achieving a 2.8-point improvement on MATH-500 in Best-of-32 sampling.

Conclusion: ComMCS is a cost-effective method to enhance reasoning in LLMs by reducing variance in process verifiers, leading to improved performance in mathematical tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

*Xinyan Jiang,Lin Zhang,Jiayi Zhang,Qingsong Yang,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSRS framework efficiently steers multiple model attributes using subspace representation fine-tuning, achieving reduced conflicts and enhanced control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods face challenges in jointly steering multiple attributes due to interference and trade-offs.

Method: MSRS uses orthogonal subspaces to isolate attribute influences, incorporates hybrid subspace composition for shared and unique steering, and employs token-level intervention during inference.

Result: MSRS significantly reduces conflicts among attributes, outperforms existing methods across attributes, and generalizes well to various tasks.

Conclusion: MSRS enhances multi-attribute steering in LLMs by refining control mechanisms and paving the way for broader application scenarios.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP, a novel conversational recommender system, combines pre-trained language models, curriculum-guided fusion, and adaptive prompts to improve recommendation precision and dialogue quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational recommender systems struggle with understanding deep semantics in user preferences and effectively integrating knowledge graph data into dialogue and recommendations.

Method: STEP utilizes pre-trained language models with an F-Former for aligning dialogue context and knowledge-graph entities via a curriculum-learning approach. The system incorporates dual adaptive prefix prompts for conversation and recommendation tasks.

Result: STEP demonstrated superior performance over existing methods in recommendation precision and dialogue quality across two public datasets.

Conclusion: STEP addresses key semantic and integration challenges in conversational recommendation systems, leveraging advanced methods to improve both dialogue generation and recommendation accuracy.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using dense graph representations for planning tasks face challenges such as information dilution, high memory demands, and infeasibility in scaling to larger problems.

Method: The proposed approach utilizes a sparse GNN representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and explicitly integrates spatial features tied to the goal.

Result: Experimental validation shows that the approach scales effectively to larger grid sizes, improves generalization of policies, and achieves higher success rates compared to dense graph representations.

Conclusion: The method provides a feasible and scalable solution for large-scale generalized planning tasks, paving the way for practical applications in realistic environments.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Sayan Nag,K J Joseph,Koustava Goswami,Vlad I Morariu,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgenticDRS, a system with multiple agents and a meta-agent for holistic graphic design evaluation, and proposes the DRS-BENCH benchmark for its assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate graphic design evaluation requires aggregating multiple aspects and expert opinions, which is challenging to execute holistically.

Method: Agentic Design Review System employs multiple agents, led by a meta-agent, using graph matching for exemplar selection and unique prompt expansion for design awareness.

Result: AgenticDRS outperformed state-of-the-art baselines and was validated through comprehensive experiments, including ablations, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The method showcases significant potential in improving graphic design evaluation and encouraging further research in this under-explored area.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

### [30] [Modeling Human Responses to Multimodal AI Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10769)
*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the risks of misinformation in AI-generated content and introduces the MhAIM Dataset for analyzing human responses to such content. It proposes new metrics and an LLM-based system to align AI with human reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to understand how AI-generated content affects human perception and behavior, focusing not just on content authenticity but also on predictive human reactions, especially in critical domains like stock trading.

Method: The researchers developed the MhAIM Dataset with 154,552 online posts (both human and AI-generated) for large-scale analysis. They conducted a human study to assess the role of text and visuals in identifying AI-generated content. Additionally, they proposed T-Lens, an LLM-based system using the HR-MCP protocol to predict human responses effectively.

Result: The study found that people were better at identifying AI-generated content with combined text and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist. Metrics like trustworthiness, impact, and openness were introduced to measure engagement with content. The T-Lens system demonstrated improved alignment with human reactions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that incorporating human response modeling into AI systems, such as through T-Lens and HR-MCP, can enhance interaction and mitigate the risks of AI-driven misinformation. Their findings emphasize the importance of integrating human-awareness into LLMs for safer content dissemination.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [31] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to effectively use their clinical knowledge for reasoning tasks. Despite high factual access accuracy, their reasoning remains limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether scaling data and parameters in large language models leads to structured and generalizable internal representations.

Method: The authors introduce a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark with four reasoning families, paired with a Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe. They evaluate six large language models using direct and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: LLMs achieved a mean accuracy of 0.918 in factual access (GKMRV) but only 0.25 in reasoning tasks, revealing systematic heuristics and shortcuts. Inference outputs were highly consistent, indicating structural limitations.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that current LLMs often have clinical knowledge but lack the composable representations needed for reliable reasoning. The approach effectively identifies gaps in LLM reliability for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the accessibility gaps in eXplainable AI (XAI) for visually impaired users through a literature review and a methodological proof of concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address the lack of accessibility in existing XAI techniques, particularly for visually impaired users, and to advance equitable accessibility in critical decision-making domains.

Method: The study uses a two-tiered approach: (1) a literature review analyzing 79 studies to assess the representation of disabled users in XAI and (2) a four-step proof of concept including categorization, persona definition, prototype creation, and evaluation.

Result: Most XAI evaluations exclude disabled users and focus on visual formats. Initial findings indicate that visually impaired users find simplified explanations more comprehensible, and accessibility improves with multimodal presentation techniques.

Conclusion: Inclusive XAI design needs simplified and multimodal explanations for equitable interpretability, highlighting the importance of integrating accessibility principles in XAI design.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

*Arkapravo Ghosh,Abhishek Moitra,Abhiroop Bhattacharjee,Ruokai Yin,Priyadarshini Panda*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative approach to hardware Design Space Exploration for AI workloads, offering significant speed and accuracy improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing optimized hardware architectures for AI workloads like DNNs and LLMs is increasingly challenging due to the complexity and vastness of design spaces.

Method: The authors propose a generative model that treats hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance metrics to efficiently explore non-differentiable, non-bijective mappings.

Result: Their framework achieves lower generation error by 0.86% with a 17000x speedup compared to Bayesian optimization and performs better in structured DSE settings, improving EDP and performance metrics significantly.

Conclusion: This generative approach overcomes traditional limitations in hardware DSE, offering faster and more accurate optimization, making it suitable for AI workloads on large design spaces.

Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware
architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs)
and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration. As
model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17),
becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from
design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct
inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based
optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient
descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative
sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep
learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using
recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less
complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative
approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on
target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable,
non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower
generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and
outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further
extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower
energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and
1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17)
design spaces. For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP
on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art DOSA framework.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnalogSeeker, an open-source language model tailored for analog circuit design, addressing the challenges of limited data, complexity of analog knowledge, and fine-tuning through novel methodologies. AnalogSeeker achieves competitive performance and is open for research use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to create a specialized foundation language model for analog circuit design, capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge and providing design assistance while overcoming challenges related to limited data and complex knowledge structures.

Method: To create AnalogSeeker, the authors collect a domain-specific corpus from curated textbooks, decompose the knowledge into granular learning nodes, and use a multi-agent framework to distill this into question-answer data pairs. They also develop a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning paradigm to enhance model training.

Result: AnalogSeeker, trained on the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model, achieves 85.04% accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, outperforming the original model by 15.67 percentage points and remaining competitive with commercial models. Additionally, it performs effectively on operational amplifier design tasks.

Conclusion: AnalogSeeker demonstrates the feasibility and utility of specialized foundation models in addressing domain-specific challenges like analog circuit design. Its open-source release aims to foster further research and development in this niche area.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker
is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research

TL;DR: The paper introduces THERMOS, a thermally-aware multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) scheduling framework that optimizes AI workloads on heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scheduling challenges in heterogeneous chiplet-based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) systems for AI workloads, considering dynamic workload characteristics, and power/thermal constraints.

Method: Proposed THERMOS, a multi-objective reinforcement learning policy that enables Pareto-optimal scheduling based on execution time, energy, or a balance of objectives, catering to runtime preferences.

Result: THERMOS achieved up to 89% faster execution time and 57% lower energy consumption compared to baseline algorithms while maintaining minimal runtime (0.14%) and energy (0.022%) overhead.

Conclusion: THERMOS effectively resolves scheduling challenges in heterogeneous PIM systems, offering significant performance and energy efficiency improvements for AI workloads.

Abstract: Chiplet-based integration enables large-scale systems that combine diverse
technologies, enabling higher yield, lower costs, and scalability, making them
well-suited to AI workloads. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a
promising solution for AI inference, leveraging technologies such as ReRAM,
SRAM, and FeFET, each offering unique advantages and trade-offs. A
heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architecture can harness the complementary
strengths of these technologies to enable higher performance and energy
efficiency. However, scheduling AI workloads across such a heterogeneous system
is challenging due to competing performance objectives, dynamic workload
characteristics, and power and thermal constraints. To address this need, we
propose THERMOS, a thermally-aware, multi-objective scheduling framework for AI
workloads on heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures. THERMOS trains a
single multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) policy that is capable of
achieving Pareto-optimal execution time, energy, or a balanced objective at
runtime, depending on the target preferences. Comprehensive evaluations show
that THERMOS achieves up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower
average energy consumption than baseline AI workload scheduling algorithms with
only 0.14% runtime and 0.022% energy overhead.

Motivation: To improve efficiency and data management in healthcare through NLP-based automation, addressing challenges in deploying AI solutions.

Method: Drawing from real-world implementation experiences at BCCR, the paper outlines key considerations for model selection, problem definition, development strategies, interdisciplinary collaboration, and quality control.

Result: The authors identify lessons such as aligning AI efforts with business objectives, using iterative development, choosing pragmatic methodologies, ensuring data quality, utilizing human-in-the-loop validation, fostering AI literacy, and mitigating errors.

Conclusion: Healthcare institutions can enhance patient care and public health outcomes by successfully integrating AI/NLP solutions, provided they adhere to lessons on iterative design, collaboration, and rigorous technical and business practices described in this paper.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a blockchain-based protocol for evaluating fairness in open-source large language models (LLMs) using datasets like PISA and StereoSet for statistical measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness concerns in LLMs are critical, particularly for high-stakes applications in domains like healthcare and education.

Method: The study evaluates LLMs using on-chain smart contracts and HTTP requests on the ICP blockchain, benchmarking statistical fairness and bias metrics on datasets like PISA and StereoSet.

Result: Findings highlight fairness evaluations of Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models across multiple benchmarks, revealing cross-linguistic disparities.

Conclusion: The open-source method ensures transparency, immutability, and reproducibility while enabling community-driven fairness monitoring and tracking across LLM versions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in thematic and task-based categorization using real-world educational data, particularly leveraging advanced techniques for understanding classroom interactions.

Method: Hierarchical categorization of messages in two dimensions (content and tasks) was achieved using state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate preprocessing for better human alignment compared to traditional computational methods.

Result: The analysis revealed novel applications and insights, demonstrating the shortcomings of classical topic modeling approaches and the advantages of using LLMs for educational data analysis.

Conclusion: The findings enrich GenAI usage in educational contexts, support stakeholders in enhancing classroom interactions, and highlight potential concerns and areas for further research in this field.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the INTIMA benchmark to evaluate AI companionship behaviors in language models, revealing varying reinforcement and boundary-setting behaviors across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI companionship's increasing role and its potential psychological effects necessitate tools to evaluate these behaviors systematically.

Method: The researchers created INTIMA with 31 behaviors categorized into four groups, supported by 368 prompts. Responses to these prompts were assessed as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral using four AI models.

Result: Key findings show that companionship-reinforcing behaviors dominate across models, but significant differences in boundary-maintaining priorities exist between commercial providers.

Conclusion: The variability in handling sensitive, emotionally charged interactions underscores the importance of consistent strategies to balance emotional support and boundary-setting in AI systems.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of detecting multimodal misinformation on social media by introducing XFacta, a real-world updated dataset for evaluating large language model (MLLM)-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid and prevalent spread of multimodal misinformation on social media necessitates effective and robust detection methods. Existing benchmarks are outdated, synthetic, or lack real-world applicability and prevent comprehensive analysis of model strategies.

Method: The researchers introduce the XFacta dataset, a contemporary misinformation detection benchmark. They systematically evaluate MLLM detection strategies across different architectures and scales. They propose a semi-automatic framework to keep XFacta updated with new content.

Result: The study provides detailed analyses of various MLLM-based misinformation detection strategies, benchmarking them against existing methods. XFacta is shown to be a more suitable dataset for maintaining relevance in social media scenarios.

Conclusion: XFacta addresses deficiencies in existing datasets while providing practical guidelines for advancing misinformation detection methodologies. It supports continuous adaptation for contemporary challenges in multimodal misinformation.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

Method: The workflow uses LLMs to generate synthetic data and formulates an automated process to search for input examples that produce the most effective synthetic data. It studies three search strategies and combines them into an ensemble algorithm tailored to class-specific characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the ensemble approach outperforms individual strategies in generating synthetic data to enhance the performance of classification models.

Conclusion: Utilizing LLM-generated synthetic data via the proposed ensemble workflow effectively addresses data scarcity issues, improving text classification model performance.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [43] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of fact-checking Hinglish, a code-mixed, low-resource language, by introducing the HiFACT dataset and a novel graph-aware fact-checking model, demonstrating better accuracy and reasoning over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the lack of effective fact-checking tools for code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish, which are widely used in politically charged contexts and have significant influence on public opinion via social media.

Method: The paper proposes a novel benchmark dataset called HiFACT, containing 1,500 annotated factual claims in Hinglish, and introduces a graph-aware fact-checking model. The model integrates multilingual encoding, semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural reasoning, and explanation generation.

Result: The proposed HiFACTMix model outperformed state-of-the-art multilingual baselines in experimental evaluations, demonstrating higher accuracy and robust justification quality for its decisions.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundational resource and method for politically relevant fact-checking in multilingual and code-mixed linguistic settings, marking a new direction in this research area.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [44] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human semantic ratings across diverse scales are low-dimensional, and LLMs exhibit similar semantic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how semantic structures in LLM embeddings resemble human semantic ratings and understand their low-dimensional nature.

Method: Analyzing projections of semantic directions within LLM embeddings across antonym pairs and comparing them to human survey results.

Result: LLMs organize semantic information similarly to humans, revealing a 3-dimensional semantic subspace and unwanted effects during token manipulation.

Conclusion: Semantic structures in LLMs reflect human language entanglement and require careful handling for steering purposes.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if attention-based explanations in Transformers (e.g., XLNet) aid medical experts in biomedical document classification, finding that visualization style significantly impacts users' perception of usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether attention weights in Transformers provide effective explanations for AI predictions, particularly in biomedical applications, and how visualization impacts their usefulness.

Method: A user study was conducted involving medical experts who classified medical articles by study design while assessing the utility of attention weights and various visualization styles.

Result: Attention weights were not strongly perceived as helpful for explaining predictions. Visualization style significantly affected perceptions; users preferred intuitive formats like text brightness or background color over precise encodings.

Conclusion: Attention weights' utility for explanation remains inconclusive, but their perceived helpfulness is influenced by visualization methods. Intuitive designs are favored over precise visual encodings.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

### [46] [From Answers to Questions: EQGBench for Evaluating LLMs' Educational Question Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10005)
*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EQGBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality educational questions in Chinese, across mathematics, physics, and chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the underexplored challenge of transitioning LLMs from problem-solving to creating pedagogically valuable questions for education.

Method: EQGBench is a benchmark with a five-dimensional evaluation framework and a dataset of 900 educational samples designed for middle school subjects. It assesses LLMs' performance in generating high-quality educational questions.

Result: The evaluation of 46 LLMs reveals significant room for growth in generating questions that enhance educational value and promote students' holistic capabilities.

Conclusion: EQGBench highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating educational questions and provides a framework for future model improvement in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [47] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ), traditionally requiring human raters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses is time-intensive as it relies on trained human raters. Automating this process could streamline research and clinical assessments.

Method: Using a dataset of AIHQ responses from individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), the study fine-tuned large language models on a portion of human-scored responses and tested their output alignment with human ratings.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed high alignment with human ratings for hostility and aggression across different scenario types and replicated group differences between TBI and HC groups. The models generalized well to a new nonclinical dataset.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively and efficiently automate AIHQ scoring, making psychological assessments more accessible and facilitating research in diverse applications.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a resource-efficient Bayesian fusion method combining scores from pre-trained LLMs and local classifier to improve automatic curation in online course forums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the resource-intensive process of retraining Large Language Models for automatic forum curation in online courses.

Method: Combine multidimensional classification scores from pre-trained LLMs and a locally trained classifier using Bayesian fusion.

Result: Proposed fusion outperformed individual classifiers and matched the performance of LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion provides an efficient alternative to LLM fine-tuning for enhancing forum auto-curation.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

*Hojun Jin,Eunsoo Hong,Ziwon Hyung,Sungjun Lim,Seungjin Lee,Keunseok Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses task interference in hard-parameter sharing models by proposing S-MoE, a supervised mixture of experts model, enhancing performance in multi-task speech-to-text applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome performance degradation caused by task interference in models that use hard-parameter sharing for diverse tasks, specifically in multi-task speech-to-text scenarios.

Method: The method introduces S-MoE, which uses task-specific guiding tokens to route tasks to separate feedforward networks, eliminating the need for gating functions and avoiding hard-parameter sharing.

Result: The S-MoE model achieves a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) for automatic speech recognition and speech translation tasks.

Conclusion: S-MoE effectively addresses task interference and enhances multi-task model performance in mixed-bandwidth speech-to-text applications.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can both produce harmful medical misinformation through 'jailbreak' attacks and detect misinformation effectively, contributing to a healthier information ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the potential for LLMs to produce medical misinformation, especially through jailbreak attacks, while also exploring their utility in detecting such misinformation.

Method: The study analyzes 109 jailbreak attacks against three LLMs, compares generated misinformation to health-related queries on Reddit, and evaluates the effectiveness of misinformation detection using machine learning approaches.

Result: Jailbroken LLM-generated misinformation bears resemblance to social media misinformation. Findings indicate that LLMs can effectively detect misinformation, whether generated by other LLMs or individuals.

Conclusion: LLMs, with careful design, present an opportunity to enhance the information environment by mitigating and detecting misinformation, reducing harm caused by erroneous outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

TL;DR: Generative AI models were tested on Japanese dietitian exam questions; only Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative marginally exceeded the passing threshold, but overall accuracy and consistency were lacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of using generative AI models as study aids for nutrition students preparing for Japanese dietitian licensure exams.

Method: Questions from the Japanese dietitian national exam were inputted into ChatGPT and Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Their responses were analyzed for accuracy, consistency, and response time. Prompt engineering techniques were also tested.

Result: The Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative models achieved accuracy above the passing threshold (66.2% and 61.4% respectively), while ChatGPT and Bing-Balanced scored below it. All models displayed issues with answer consistency and robustness.

Conclusion: Generative AI models show potential as study aids but currently lack the necessary accuracy and stability to be reliable for dietitian licensure exam preparation. Improvements are needed for broader adoption in nutrition education.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GG Explore bridges the gap between queries and structured knowledge to improve efficiency and accuracy in knowledge retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the knowledge-intensive task performance of LLMs by addressing limitations in current knowledge graph exploration methods.

Method: Introduce GG Explore, which uses a Guidance Graph to define and abstract the retrieval space, incorporating Structural Alignment and Context Aware Pruning techniques.

Result: GG Explore achieves superior efficiency, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on complex tasks, and demonstrates effectiveness with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed GG Explore method enhances knowledge exploration processes, making them more efficient and applicable across various scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Semantic Bridge, a universal framework for generating complex multi-hop reasoning questions from sparse domain-specific sources, addressing the scarcity of high-quality training data for large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from sparse domain-specific sources like PubMed papers and legal documents, limits LLM training advancement.

Method: The paper introduces "semantic graph weaving" based on AMR-driven analysis with mechanisms like entity bridging, predicate chain bridging, and causal bridging to construct reasoning pathways across documents.

Result: The framework achieves up to 9.5% better quality, yielding 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages, and outperforms native human annotation with fewer materials while improving complexity, answerability, and pattern coverage.

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge provides a paradigm shift for LLM training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of high-quality reasoning questions, and announces the release of the core code and model.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current evaluation of role-playing fidelity using LLMs lacks human-aligned metrics and suffers from subpar role identification accuracy compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve evaluation metrics regarding role-playing fidelity in dialogues, focusing on LLMs' ability to align their judgments with human standards.

Method: Introducing PersonaEval, a benchmark using human-authored dialogues to test LLMs’ accuracy in identifying persona alignment in conversations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate LLMs achieve only ~69% accuracy, far below humans at 90.8%, showing a substantial gap in role identification reliability.

Conclusion: Reliable evaluation of role-playing scenarios requires LLMs to develop human-like reasoning capabilities beyond task-specific adjustments.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents RealTalk-CN, a Chinese dual-modal task-oriented dialogue dataset for speech and text. It includes annotated speech disfluencies and supports cross-modal tasks for robust LLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although speech-based large language models have advanced significantly, existing task-oriented dialogue datasets mostly focus on text, with limited speech data (and primarily in English), lacking disfluencies and speaker variations. This gap hinders thorough evaluation and improvements in speech-based LLMs.

Method: The authors introduced RealTalk-CN: a multi-turn, multi-domain dataset in Chinese with 5.4k dialogues and annotations covering spontaneous speech disfluencies and diverse user interactions. They also created a new cross-modal chat task for dynamic interaction in speech-text modalities.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate RealTalk-CN's ability to test robustness against speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker traits, and cross-domain performance. The dataset supports realistic user interaction simulations.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN offers a valuable resource for advancing Chinese speech-based LLMs, filling a critical research gap with its dual-modal nature and real-world complexities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

*Tianyu Xie,Yuhang Wu,Yongdong Luo,Jiayi Ji,Xiawu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration (MLLM Orchestration), enabling interactive multimodal systems without requiring additional training, improving modularity, efficiency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multimodal systems require training due to challenges like modal alignment and integration inefficiencies. The paper seeks to create a system that bypasses the need for additional training while maintaining high performance.

Method: The approach involves using a central controller LLM, a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture for seamless interaction, and a cross-modal memory integration system for coherent context maintenance.

Result: MLLM Orchestration improves multimodal capabilities without extra training, yielding 7.8% performance gains over jointly-trained systems, 10.3% reduced latency, and better interpretability.

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration is effective for creating multimodal AI systems without training, offering enhanced functionality, efficiency, and interpretability through explicit orchestration workflows.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

### [57] [A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet: Categorical Homotopy Theory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10018)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework to address inconsistencies in LLM output probabilities for equivalent statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to generate consistent probabilities for equivalent yet superficially different sentences, which is a problem as language is inherently full of rephrases.

Method: The authors propose an LLM Markov category framework, characterizing sentence probabilities as arrows in a Markov category, and employ categorical homotopy techniques to handle weak equivalences for rephrased sentences.

Result: A detailed theoretical framework is presented, utilizing advanced concepts like higher algebraic K-theory and model categories to ensure LLM robustness in probabilistic consistency.

Conclusion: The paper lays a mathematical foundation for improving LLM consistency by capturing equivalences between rephrased statements using categorical homotopy theory.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

### [58] [Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019)
*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DURIT, a framework to improve reasoning in Small Language Models (SLMs) by separating problem understanding from reasoning. DURIT employs iterative training and reinforcement learning to help SLMs handle diverse natural language inputs more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning capabilities in Small Language Models (SLMs) is challenging due to linguistic complexity and variability, which create a noisy problem space that complicates optimization for models with limited capacity.

Method: The DURIT framework decouples natural language understanding from reasoning by mapping input problems to a simplified canonical problem space. It employs a three-step iterative training strategy involving reinforcement learning, self-distillation, and reasoning policy training, with co-training for mappers and reasoners.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DURIT significantly enhances SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematical and logical domains.

Conclusion: Decoupling understanding from reasoning is an effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities and robustness of Small Language Models (SLMs).

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

### [59] [FedCoT: Communication-Efficient Federated Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10020)
*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedCoT, a framework to improve reasoning capabilities in large language models within federated learning setups, especially for medical applications, by using a chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism and advanced aggregation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of boosting reasoning capabilities in LLMs for federated learning setups like healthcare, which demands privacy, accountability, and interpretable rationales.

Method: FedCoT utilizes a chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism where local models generate reasoning paths and a compact discriminator selects the best one. It includes improved aggregation via LoRA module stacking and classifier-aware adjustments.

Result: FedCoT improves reasoning accuracy, robustness, and interpretability while adhering to privacy constraints and minimizing communication overhead.

Conclusion: FedCoT successfully enhances reasoning in federated learning settings, especially in medical domains, while respecting resource and privacy constraints.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

*Egor Fadeev,Dzhambulat Mollaev,Aleksei Shestov,Dima Korolev,Omar Zoloev,Ivan Kireev,Andrey Savchenko,Maksim Makarenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes LATTE, a framework for aligning raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from LLMs for financial applications, reducing cost and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the computational inefficiency and impracticality of applying large language models (LLMs) to long event sequences in real-time financial systems.

Method: The LATTE framework uses contrastive learning to align raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are represented as short prompts and used for supervision via contrastive loss.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques in learning event sequence representations from real-world financial datasets, while being deployable in latency-restricted conditions.

Conclusion: By leveraging contrastive learning and embedding alignment, LATTE offers an efficient, deployable solution for creating client embeddings in financial applications, striking a balance between performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

### [61] [Conformal P-Value in Multiple-Choice Question Answering Tasks with Provable Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10022)
*Yuanchang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction (CP) framework to improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for answering disciplinary questions but suffer from hallucinations and nonfactual outputs, undermining trust in their responses.

Method: The framework combines $p$-value computation with conformity scoring, using self-consistency resampling to generate prediction sets through null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) and empirically derived $p$-values.

Result: Experiments on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks show that the enhanced CP achieves miscoverage rates specified by the user, and the average prediction set size decreases as risk tolerance ($\alpha$) increases, indicating effective uncertainty measurement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a methodologically sound statistical approach to improve the trustworthiness of LLMs in critical QA applications.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

### [62] [RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10024)
*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work introduces Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), an adaptive framework improving Large Language Model (LLM) accuracy by selecting optimal test-time strategies while minimizing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiency and computational overhead of indiscriminately applying test-time adaptation strategies like TTT and RAG, by providing a more adaptive mechanism.

Method: RTTC uses a pretrained reward model to adaptively select the best test-time compute strategy per query, integrates a server-client architecture for distributed management, and incorporates Query-State Caching to reuse compute history efficiently.

Result: Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks show RTTC outperforms traditional strategies like vanilla RAG and TTT in downstream accuracy while reducing unnecessary computation.

Conclusion: RTTC demonstrates the importance of adaptive, reward-driven selection mechanisms for test-time strategies in achieving scalable and high-performance language model adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

*Silvia García-Méndez,Francisco de Arriba-Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an intelligent system for real-time detection of postpartum depression (PPD) using natural language processing, machine learning, and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to aid in the rapid detection of postpartum depression to provide timely and effective interventions for affected mothers using innovative technology.

Method: The study developed a real-time PPD screening solution that integrates NLP, machine learning, and interpretable tree-based algorithms. It uses LLMs for explainable predictions and free speech analysis to detect PPD.

Result: The proposed system achieved a 90% success rate across evaluation metrics, surpassing existing solutions in the field.

Conclusion: The intelligent PPD screening system contributes to timely detection and intervention, combining high accuracy with interpretability to assist medical practitioners effectively.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

*Kai Zhao,Yanjun Zhao,Jiaming Song,Shien He,Lusheng Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Tianjiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABER is an efficient reinforcement learning framework for large language models to optimize reasoning depth and latency based on user-defined token budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high computational costs of uniformly applying Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs across diverse tasks.

Method: Reinforcement learning is used to assign token budgets to training examples, incorporate length-aware rewards during fine-tuning, and introduce four inference modes (NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, DeepThink) for flexible reasoning trade-offs.

Result: SABER shows improved reasoning efficiency, with FastThink reducing reasoning length by 65.4% and achieving a 3.6% accuracy improvement on the MATH benchmark.

Conclusion: SABER enables LLMs to flexibly balance reasoning depth and latency, achieving high accuracy across tasks and budgets, with effective generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores a hybrid method combining transformer embeddings and handcrafted linguistic features to improve Alzheimer's detection from speech, assessing data augmentation using synthetic speech from LLMs and benchmarking unimodal and multimodal classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over half of the five million US adults with Alzheimer's and related dementias remain undiagnosed. The paper aims to explore scalable speech-based NLP methods to identify early cognitive decline.

Method: The study uses transcripts from DementiaBank ("cookie-theft" task) and evaluates 10 transformers with three fine-tuning strategies. A fusion model combines embeddings from top transformers with linguistic features. Additionally, LLMs generate synthetic speech for data augmentation, and multimodal models are tested for classification.

Result: The fusion model achieved significant improvements (F1 = 83.3, AUC = 89.5). Augmentation with synthetic speech further boosted F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning enhanced unimodal LLM classifiers, while multimodal models underperformed current strategies.

Conclusion: The integration of transformers with linguistic features improves ADRD detection, and synthetic speech supports classification and training augmentation. However, multimodal model performance needs improvement for broader applications.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

*Xiao Fu,Hossein A. Rahmani,Bin Wu,Jerome Ramos,Emine Yilmaz,Aldo Lipani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes PREF, a framework for evaluating personalized text generation without gold references. PREF focuses on universal quality and user-specific aspects using a structured three-step process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods fail to consider user individuality in personalized text generation systems.

Method: PREF has three stages: (1) Coverage creates universal evaluation guidelines using LLMs; (2) Preference customizes guidelines for user-specific needs; (3) Scoring evaluates outputs using a personalized rubric.

Result: Experiments show PREF yields better alignment with human judgments, accuracy, and calibration compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: PREF enhances scalable, interpretable, and personalized evaluations, promoting better development of language generation systems.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

*Wenpeng Xing,Mohan Li,Chunqiang Hu,Haitao XuNingyu Zhang,Bo Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel jailbreak attack method called LFJ, which uses interpolation of hidden states to generate harmful responses from large language models, achieving a high attack success rate. A proposed adversarial training defense significantly mitigates the attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities in large language models, specifically jailbreak attacks that bypass safety measures, and to find effective ways to mitigate these attacks.

Method: The LFJ attack chooses thematically and syntactically similar query pairs, performs interpolation in hidden states guided by gradients, and optimizes for attack success, fluency, and computational efficiency. A defensive adversarial training approach is also proposed.

Result: LFJ achieves an average attack success rate of 94.01%, surpassing other methods. The proposed adversarial training defense reduces the attack success rate by over 80% while maintaining performance on benign inputs.

Conclusion: LFJ effectively highlights vulnerabilities in LLMs while the proposed mitigation strategy showcases potential for enhancing model safety without impairing normal functionality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

*Saaduddin Mahmud,Mason Nakamura,Kyle H. Wray,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization), combining prompt optimization and inference scaling strategies to optimize alignment and performance of large language models based on budget and task objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt optimization methods fail to integrate inference strategies, despite their critical interdependence, leaving a methodological gap in effective LLM alignment.

Method: The authors propose IAPO, a unified framework that jointly optimizes prompts and inference scale within budget and objective constraints. They also develop PSST, a training method for fixed-budget optimization.

Result: Experimental results on six diverse tasks demonstrate improved alignment and performance using inference-aware prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Incorporating inference-awareness in prompt optimization is essential for more effective alignment and task-specific performance of LLMs, especially under budget constraints.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

*Fan Yang*

TL;DR: Thinking mode in large language models (LLMs) is found to be more vulnerable to Jailbreak attacks compared to non-thinking mode. The proposed safe thinking intervention method improves LLM robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of LLMs in thinking mode to Jailbreak attacks, which poses significant risks in generating harmful responses.

Method: Developed a 'safe thinking intervention' method that incorporates specific thinking tokens into LLM prompts to guide safer internal thinking processes.

Result: Safe thinking intervention significantly reduces the attack success rate on thinking-mode LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the security of LLMs operating in thinking mode, mitigating their susceptibility to Jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a method that selects few-shot examples based on a model's uncertainty assessment to improve LLM-based information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of selecting appropriate in-context examples for few-shot LLMs, emphasizing that conventional strategies often fail to mitigate confusion in semantic content and structured generation.

Method: APIE uses a dual-component uncertainty metric to quantify Format Uncertainty (structural difficulties) and Content Uncertainty (semantic inconsistencies). High-uncertainty samples are chosen as few-shot exemplars to enhance model accuracy and robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that APIE achieves notable improvements in information extraction accuracy and robustness compared to strong baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of a nuanced, dual-level understanding of model uncertainty for developing effective information extraction systems, enhancing both performance and reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

*Nghia Trung Ngo,Franck Dernoncourt,Thien Huu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces mSCoRe, a benchmark to test large language models’ (LLMs) multilingual commonsense reasoning skills through reasoning skill taxonomy, data synthesis, and complexity scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well LLMs utilize various human reasoning skills for multilingual commonsense reasoning, which remains poorly understood.

Method: The mSCoRe benchmark was developed with three components: a reasoning skill taxonomy for fine-grained model analysis, a data synthesis pipeline tailored for commonsense reasoning, and a framework for dynamically scaling task complexity.

Result: Experiments on eight state-of-the-art LLMs show that mSCoRe presents significant challenges, especially at high complexity levels, and reveals models' limitations in nuanced multilingual commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: This benchmark highlights both the challenges faced by LLMs in multilingual reasoning and opportunities for model improvement, guiding future developments in this area.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark to test reasoning, dialogue, and information-seeking skills of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with nuanced, interactive tasks typical of real-world applications, highlighting the need for improved logical and multi-turn dialogue capabilities.

Method: A new benchmark comprises deterministic multi-turn tasks targeting reasoning, interaction, and information retrieval abilities without requiring human evaluation.

Result: Most frontier LLMs show significant room for improvement with errors arising from poor reasoning, planning, and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides critical insights into current LLM limitations and a platform for advancing interactive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

*Gal Amram,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Raviv Gal,Avi Ziv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces LaaJMeter, a simulation framework to validate Large Language Models used as evaluators in tasks, especially in domain-specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the difficulty in evaluating LaaJs in domain-specific settings due to a lack of annotated data and costly expert evaluations.

Method: The paper proposes LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework that generates synthetic data, allowing controlled meta-evaluation of LLM evaluators using virtual models and judges.

Result: Using LaaJMeter on a code translation task, the paper shows the varying sensitivity of metrics and their limitations in assessing evaluator quality.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter aids metric validation and evaluator refinement in low-resource NLP settings, promoting reliable and reproducible evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Vilém Zouhar,Roberto Navigli,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces translation difficulty estimation to identify challenging texts for machine translation and proposes metrics and models to achieve this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine translation systems are nearing near-perfect translations in some scenarios, making it harder to differentiate between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for improvement.

Method: The authors formalize translation difficulty estimation, define difficulty based on the expected translation quality, introduce a new evaluation metric, and propose and assess novel difficulty estimator models.

Result: Dedicated models like Sentinel-src outperform heuristic-based methods and LLM-based approaches. Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25 are released as tools for selecting challenging text collections.

Conclusion: Difficulty estimators help enhance machine translation benchmarks and guide improvements in modern translation systems. These new tools push forward discriminative evaluations and future research.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

*Wenlong Deng,Jiaming Zhang,Qi Zeng,Christos Thrampoulidis,Boying Gong,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: For-Value proposes a framework for scalable and efficient data valuation in LLMs and VLMs using a straightforward forward-pass approach, avoiding computationally expensive gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data valuation is crucial for improving transparency and accountability in large language and vision-language models, but existing methods are computationally infeasible for billion-parameter models.

Method: It introduces a lightweight approach leveraging foundation model representations through a closed-form expression computed in a single forward pass.

Result: For-Value demonstrates high accuracy in estimating sample influence, surpassing or matching traditional gradient-based methods in tasks such as identifying impactful examples and detecting mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value provides an effective and computationally efficient alternative for data valuation, especially suitable for large foundation models.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PakBBQ, a cultural and regional extension of the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering to address biases in large language models for low-resource languages like Urdu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the problem of inherent Western-centric biases in LLMs and their lack of fairness for users from low-resource linguistic and cultural backgrounds, particularly in Pakistan.

Method: The authors created PakBBQ, a dataset comprising 17,180 QA pairs across 8 categories relevant to biases in Pakistan. They evaluated multilingual LLMs using this dataset under various contextual conditions, such as ambiguous vs. disambiguated setups and question framings.

Result: Tests using PakBBQ revealed that disambiguation increased accuracy by 12%, Urdu showed stronger counter-bias behaviors compared to English, and negative question framing reduced stereotypical responses.

Conclusion: Contextualized datasets like PakBBQ and prompt engineering can substantially mitigate LLM biases in low-resource settings, emphasizing the need for regionally tailored benchmarks.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

### [77] [Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM) to detect faithfulness hallucinations in LLMs by analyzing semantic deviations between prompts and responses through clustering and information-theoretic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods in detecting errors in LLM outputs, specifically faithfulness hallucinations like confabulations, which undermine the reliability of LLMs.

Method: The authors propose SDM, which uses joint clustering of sentence embeddings to visualize and quantify semantic divergence via heatmaps and metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance.

Result: SDM successfully identifies faithfulness hallucinations and facilitates distinguishing generative behaviors through indicators like KL divergence.

Conclusion: SDM offers a refined approach to assessing LLM fidelity, advancing diagnostic capabilities and improving reliability in handling user inputs.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models (LLMs) to predict Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores from clinical interview transcripts of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia, demonstrating almost human-level prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring symptoms in CHR patients for schizophrenia is crucial, yet the standard measurement tool (BPRS) is underutilized in clinical practice due to its complexity and time requirements.

Method: They analyzed transcripts from 409 CHR patients, using LLMs in a zero-shot setup to predict BPRS scores, and validated the models against true assessments. LLMs' capabilities were evaluated across foreign language transcripts and longitudinal integrations.

Result: LLMs achieved median concordance of 0.84 and ICC of 0.73, aligning with human inter- and intra-rater reliability. For foreign language analysis, median concordance was 0.88 and ICC was 0.70, showing the model's strong adaptability.

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly improve and standardize BPRS-based assessments in CHR patients, overcoming language and longitudinal assessment barriers to enhance clinical application.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

TL;DR: The study analyzes language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed language with 120 core words, using computational and corpus-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate how sociolinguistic factors and natural usage influence the evolution and variation in a constructed language like Toki Pona.

Method: Computational and corpus-based approaches are used to study changes in syntactic preferences and cross-corpus variations in this constructed language.

Result: Findings show that sociolinguistic factors lead to natural evolution in Toki Pona, similar to what occurs in natural languages.

Conclusion: Constructed languages like Toki Pona undergo natural evolution driven by sociolinguistic influences, demonstrating that linguistic systems inherently evolve through usage.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

*Christian M. Angel,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method leveraging an LLM's output to optimize prompts, leading to better performance on tasks like classification and ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to slight changes in prompt wording, hypothesizing that this is caused by inductive bias inherent to the models.

Method: The researchers propose an Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching strategy, where an LLM's own output is used as part of the prompt to align it with the model's inductive bias.

Result: The strategy achieves empirical improvements, with classification performance increasing by up to 19% and ranking performance improving by up to 27%, as measured by LLM Likert ratings.

Conclusion: Incorporating the model's inductive bias into the prompt creation process enhances the effectiveness of LLMs in specific tasks like classification and ranking.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

*Gustavo Bonil,Simone Hashiguti,Jhessica Silva,João Gondim,Helena Maia,Nádia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study highlights how biases and hegemonic discourses, such as racial and gender stereotypes, manifest in narratives generated by large language models (LLMs). It proposes a qualitative, discursive analysis framework to complement current quantitative methods in identifying these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and assess biases in large language models (LLMs), particularly racial and gender biases, and to propose a more nuanced analysis beyond automated and quantitative approaches.

Method: A qualitative, discursive analysis framework was employed to manually examine LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women. This method identified patterns in how biases and discriminatory portrayals manifest in generated outputs.

Result: Findings indicated that Black women were often portrayed in connection with ancestry and resistance, whereas white women were depicted in self-discovery narratives. Even with bias correction prompts, the models made only superficial changes without addressing deeper problematic meanings.

Conclusion: The study underscores the ideological role of algorithms in reinforcing social inequalities, pointing to the limitations of current bias mitigation techniques in LLMs. It advocates for critical, interdisciplinary approaches in AI development to mitigate perpetuation of stereotypes and discriminatory narratives.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of paper submissions and reviewer fatigue necessitate automation in peer review, as current methods lack accuracy and depth.

Method: ReviewRL integrates reinforcement learning, retrieval-augmented context from scientific literature, supervised fine-tuning for foundational skills, and a composite reward function to enhance review quality and accuracy.

Result: Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers show ReviewRL outperforms existing review methods based on quality metrics, promising better automatic critique generation.

Conclusion: ReviewRL is a foundational framework for RL-driven paper reviews, driving future advancements in automated scientific critiques and will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

*Xuan Li,Jialiang Dong,Raymond Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DOTABLER introduces a framework for semantically linking tables within documents, achieving over 90% Precision and F1 scores in tested datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches focus only on surface-level table tasks, failing to address deeper semantic connections between tables and their surrounding content, which are crucial for advanced analytical tasks.

Method: DOTABLER combines domain-specific fine-tuned pre-trained models with a custom dataset, implementing a parsing pipeline to semantically link tables with their contextual content.

Result: DOTABLER performs two major functions—table-centric structure parsing and domain-specific table retrieval—achieving high performance metrics in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DOTABLER significantly outperforms existing models in semantic document parsing and table-context linkage, showcasing its utility for complex data analysis tasks in diverse domains.

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

*Minhao Wang,Yunhang He,Cong Xu,Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec addresses limitations in LLM-based recommender systems by balancing semantic and collaborative information via spectral processing techniques, achieving up to an 8% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based recommender systems often overemphasize semantic correlations while diminishing collaborative signals, leading to reduced recommendation quality.

Method: The proposed method, FreLLM4Rec, employs a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to remove noise from embeddings and Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) to preserve collaborative signals during propagation through LLM layers.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets showcase FreLLM4Rec's ability to mitigate collaborative signal attenuation and improve recommendation performance, with up to 8% better NDCG@10 scores compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec provides a robust solution to strengthen collaborative signals in LLM-based recommender systems while offering theoretical and practical insights for further advancements.

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), a novel prompt-based approach for improving low-performing languages in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. It also proposes a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism for enhanced multilingual adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving low-performing languages in fine-tuning large language models, where these languages exhibit poor performance even with full-model fine-tuning.

Method: The paper introduces XPE, which combines lightweight encoding architecture and multi-source training from diverse languages, to identify transferable patterns. It also presents a Dual Soft Prompt design that merges encoder-based prompts with directly trained soft prompts.

Result: Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark demonstrate that XPE effectively enhances low-performing languages, while the hybrid Dual Soft Prompt design improves adaptability across multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: XPE excels in assisting low-performing languages, and its combination with Dual Soft Prompts enhances flexibility for broader multilingual performance.

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

### [86] [Making Qwen3 Think in Korean with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10355)
*Jungyup Lee,Jemin Kim,Sang Park,SeungJae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage fine-tuning approach for adapting Qwen3 14B to think natively in Korean, focusing on reasoning and problem-solving tasks. The approach uses supervised fine-tuning and a customized reinforcement learning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the large language model Qwen3 14B to perform logical reasoning and problem solving natively in Korean while maintaining its general capabilities.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning approach: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset, and (2) Reinforcement Learning utilizing a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, addressing stability issues via an oracle judge model.

Result: The fine-tuning leads to stable learning, avoiding GRPO training issues like reward hacking and policy collapse, and shows improved performance on advanced reasoning tasks (e.g., math and coding) in Korean.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances reasoning and problem-solving in Korean within the Qwen3 14B model, showcasing the ability to conduct chain-of-thought reasoning natively in Korean without losing general language and knowledge capabilities.

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence method for cross-lingual ABSA tasks without relying on external translation tools, achieving a performance boost of up to 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performing aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in low-resource languages, which is hindered by the predominant focus on English and dependence on translation tools.

Method: The authors propose a novel sequence-to-sequence method with constrained decoding, specifically designed for compound ABSA tasks in a cross-lingual setting.

Result: Their approach improves ABSA performance by up to 10% and shows that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs perform well, English-centric LLMs are less effective for these tasks.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient, translation-independent solution for complex cross-lingual ABSA tasks and broadens their scope, presenting an alternative to current translation-reliant techniques.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

*Václav Tran,Jakub Šmíd,Jiří Martínek,Ladislav Lenc,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Czech text summarization, especially for historical documents, using advanced language models like Mistral and mT5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Czech text summarization remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and the lack of annotated datasets.

Method: The study leverages advanced language models like Mistral and mT5 for both modern and historical Czech text summarization.

Result: State-of-the-art results were achieved on the SumeCzech dataset, and a new dataset for historical Czech documents, Posel od Čerchova, was introduced along with baseline results.

Conclusion: The study advances Czech text summarization efforts, highlighting opportunities for further developments in historical Czech text processing.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel methods for improving aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) for low-resource languages, achieving performance boosts using constrained decoding and multi-tasking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of effective ABSA techniques for low-resource languages compared to English, aiming to avoid dependency on unreliable external translation tools.

Method: The method leverages constrained decoding in sequence-to-sequence models to improve cross-lingual ABSA performance and supports multi-tasking across multiple languages and tasks.

Result: The approach improves cross-lingual performance by 5% on complex tasks and boosts multi-task results by over 10%. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods across seven languages and six tasks.

Conclusion: The study advances cross-lingual ABSA methodologies by setting new benchmarks, evaluating large language models, and providing practical recommendations, emphasizing fine-tuning for real-world applications.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

*Chiyu Zhang,Lu Zhou,Xiaogang Xu,Jiafei Wu,Liming Fang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces MDH, a framework using LLMs with minimal human assistance to improve malicious content detection. Two new attack strategies, D-Attack and DH-CoT, are proposed to enhance jailbreak success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to refine the evaluation of jailbreak attacks and malicious prompts, addressing challenges like unsuitable prompts and limitations in manual tasks or LLMs.

Method: A hybrid approach combining LLM annotation with limited human oversight, named MDH, is introduced. Additionally, two strategies, D-Attack (context simulation) and DH-CoT (hijacked thought chains), are developed.

Result: MDH achieves a balance between accuracy and efficiency for malicious content detection. The proposed attack strategies improve jailbreak success rates.

Conclusion: By integrating MDH and the two proposed attack techniques, the study offers a method to effectively clean datasets and assess jailbreak attacks. Codes and data are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Qirui Wang,Yuji Kosuga,Mengqiu Tian,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel adversarial attack method, the Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF), aimed at identifying vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by perturbing critical features in text using sparse autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating adversarial examples for jailbreaking LLMs, thereby enhancing the understanding of model vulnerabilities and improving robustness.

Method: The Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF) employs sparse autoencoders to reconstruct hidden layer representations, performs feature clustering on successfully attacked texts, and perturbs highly activated features to generate adversarial texts.

Result: Adversarial texts generated by SFPF successfully bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, exposing ongoing vulnerabilities in NLP systems. However, performance variability across prompts and layers is noted, and its application to other architectures and larger models is yet to be tested.

Conclusion: SFPF offers a promising strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety alignment, but further validation is needed for generalizability across diverse NLP architectures.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

*Juyuan Wang,Rongchen Zhao,Wei Wei,Yufeng Wang,Mo Yu,Jie Zhou,Jin Xu,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ComoRAG, a narrative reasoning framework using iterative memory-based cycles for enhanced understanding of long texts, outperforming traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of comprehending long narratives and novels with intricate plots, as traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods struggle with dynamic reasoning processes.

Method: ComoRAG utilizes iterative reasoning cycles that interact with a dynamic memory workspace. It generates querying paths, retrieves new evidence, integrates insights into a global memory pool, and builds a coherent context for resolving queries.

Result: ComoRAG achieved up to 11% improvement over the strongest RAG baselines across four long-context narrative benchmarks comprising over 200K tokens.

Conclusion: ComoRAG offers a cognitively motivated and stateful reasoning paradigm that enhances retrieval-based long context comprehension, particularly for complex queries requiring global understanding.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code
is publicly released at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG

### [93] [Evaluating LLMs on Chinese Idiom Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10421)
*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the challenges of Chinese idiom translation using several machine translation systems and introduces a new evaluation framework, IdiomEval, to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine translation systems struggle with idiom translations, especially Chinese idioms which often have figurative meanings and cultural references. Precise translation is critical for maintaining idiomatic essence.

Method: The authors designed IdiomEval, a framework with an error taxonomy to evaluate idiom translations, and assessed 900 translation pairs from nine systems across different textual domains.

Result: Most systems, including GPT-4, failed to reliably translate idioms, with the best-performing system making errors in 28% of cases. Existing evaluation metrics also correlated poorly with human judgment.

Conclusion: Current machine translation systems are inadequate for Chinese idiom translation, and idiom-specific evaluation methods are necessary to improve quality.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to enhance computational efficiency in LLMs by modeling them as an internal economy constrained by computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of LLMs caused by high computational costs and explore efficient resource allocation methods.

Method: The authors propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that incorporates a differentiable computation cost term alongside the task loss to encourage sparse and efficient activations.

Result: Their method achieves models that reduce FLOPS by about 40%, lower latency, and exhibit interpretable attention patterns, outperforming post-hoc pruning.

Conclusion: Economic principles can guide the design of computationally efficient, adaptive, and transparent LLMs under resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

*Herun Wan,Jiaying Wu,Minnan Luo,Xiangzheng Kong,Zihan Ma,Zhi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR is a framework that generates high-quality rationales to support misinformation detection by addressing challenges of diversity, factual accuracy, and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for generating textual rationales often suffer from issues like limited diversity, hallucinations, and noisy content, which reduce the effectiveness of misinformation detectors.

Method: DiFaR uses chain-of-thought prompts to drive diverse reasoning in large vision-language models and applies a post-hoc filtering module to ensure factual and relevant rationales.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show DiFaR surpasses baselines by up to 5.9% and improves existing detectors by up to 8.7%. Enhanced rationale quality was validated via metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: DiFaR improves rationale generation across diversity, factuality, and relevance, significantly enhancing misinformation detection systems.

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trade-off between explainability and privacy in natural language processing (NLP), exploring whether both properties can coexist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding the interaction and compatibility between explainability and privacy preservation in NLP systems.

Method: The authors conduct an empirical study focusing on Differential Privacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability methods to assess their interaction.

Result: The study reveals that the relationship between privacy and explainability depends on several factors such as the type of downstream task and the methods employed for text privatization and explainability.

Conclusion: It is possible for privacy and explainability to coexist in NLP systems under certain conditions, and the paper offers practical recommendations for advancing research in this area.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

*Huyu Wu,Meng Tang,Xinhan Zheng,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and systematically investigates the issue of text dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across various modalities and proposes evaluation metrics along with a token compression method to alleviate this imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the pervasive issue of text dominance in MLLMs, which limits their effective utilization of non-text modalities in multimodal tasks.

Method: The authors introduce two metrics, Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and Attention Efficiency Index (AEI), to quantify text dominance. They analyze underlying causes and propose a token compression method to rebalance attention in these models.

Result: The token compression method significantly reduces text dominance, as evidenced by metrics like MDI dropping from 10.23 to 0.86 in LLaVA-7B, while revealing structural causes of the imbalance.

Conclusion: This work provides critical insights into text dominance in MLLMs, establishing evaluation tools and proposing practical solutions to enhance multimodal performance and equity in model design.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

Method: The study used a GPU-based cluster at Ansbach University, connecting researchers via the NNsight API, with interventions like activation patching and representation analysis performed on models like GPT-2.

Result: The platform showed stable performance, increased user engagement, and was welcomed for its remote experimentation, despite challenges like data download delays and execution interruptions.

Conclusion: The initiative successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the eDIF platform, outlining its potential to support broader deployment and community collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study on the deployment of a European Deep
Inference Fabric (eDIF), an NDIF-compatible infrastructure designed to support
mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic
interpretability research.

Conclusion: The fusion-based approach outperforms existing models and highlights the value of gloss-free translation for improved communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing, setting a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

### [101] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes VAC, a framework for personalized response generation in large language models, using natural language feedback (NLF) for better supervision compared to scalar rewards. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the LaMP-QA benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve personalization in language models for tasks like question answering by addressing the limitations of scalar rewards used in current methods.

Method: VAC framework uses natural language feedback (NLF) derived from user profiles and question narratives to provide actionable supervision, enabling iterative refinement of model responses.

Result: Significant improvements over previous methods on the LaMP-QA benchmark across three domains, along with superior results in human evaluations.

Conclusion: NLF offers more effective optimization signals for personalized question answering, advancing the state of the art in enhancing user satisfaction and response quality.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ICE, a framework for diffusion large language models (dLLMs), leveraging their bidirectional attention and iterative refinement for in-place prompting, achieving higher accuracy and significant speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of prefix-only prompting and sequential generation in LLMs by utilizing the bidirectional attention and iterative refinement in dLLMs.

Method: The proposed ICE framework integrates in-place prompts during token refinement, using a confidence-aware early exit mechanism for efficiency.

Result: ICE achieves up to 17.29% accuracy improvement and up to 4.12x speedup on GSM8K, and a 276.67x acceleration on MMLU, while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: ICE effectively transforms the prompting paradigm of dLLMs, optimizing their flexibility, accuracy, and efficiency, demonstrating a substantial computational advantage.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

*Jim Dilkes,Vahid Yazdanpanah,Sebastian Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm, MS-GRPO, for improving small LLMs in sequential decision-making tasks, achieving significant performance gains over larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance on computationally expensive large models limits the use of LLMs in sequential decision-making, creating a need for efficient methods that improve smaller models.

Method: The authors propose MS-GRPO, grounded in formal frameworks, and utilize an innovative credit assignment technique along with a weighted episode sampling strategy.

Result: Post-training a 3B parameter model using MS-GRPO improved its decision-making performance, outperforming a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on the Frozen Lake task.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training methods like MS-GRPO provide a resource-efficient alternative to relying on model scale for sequential decision-making agent development with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortage of qualified mental health professionals and enhance the reliability and effectiveness of psychological applications using large language models.

Method: The authors employ a data synthesis pipeline for generating high-quality psychological questions and empathetic dialogues, combined with a hybrid training strategy using group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Result: Psyche-R1 demonstrates effectiveness across multiple psychological benchmarks, achieving comparable results to models with significantly larger parameters.

Conclusion: Psyche-R1 is a pioneering step in integrating reasoning, psychological expertise, and empathy in LLMs, showing potential to alleviate mental health burdens in real-world applications.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in automated interpreting quality assessment through a framework emphasizing explainability, feature engineering, data augmentation, and Shapley Value analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research in interpreting quality assessment struggles with limited focus on language use quality, inadequate modeling due to data limitations, and lack of explainability in predictions.

Method: The authors propose a multi-dimensional framework incorporating feature engineering, data augmentation, and explainable machine learning tools like SHAP analysis. They emphasize the use of transparent, relevant features instead of 'black box' methods.

Result: Strong predictive results were achieved using an English-Chinese interpreting dataset. Key predictive features identified include BLEURT and CometKiwi for fidelity, pause-related features for fluency, and phraseological diversity metrics for language use.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates scalable, reliable evaluation methods and highlights explainability, offering detailed feedback to learners and promoting self-regulated learning beyond simplistic automated scoring.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs as simulators for agentic search tasks in RL, minimizing the dependence on costly interactions with external search engines.

Method: The study quantified LLMs' search capability using structured prompting and repeated sampling (Self-Search) and introduced Self-Search RL (SSRL), which utilizes format- and rule-based rewards to iteratively refine LLMs' internal knowledge utilization.

Result: LLMs demonstrated strong intrinsic search scaling behavior, high performance on benchmarks, and cost-effective, stable environments for RL training. They also exhibit reduced hallucinations and integrate well with external tools post-SSRL training.

Conclusion: LLMs can support scalable RL training by effectively utilizing their internal world knowledge, reducing reliance on external engines and improving robustness, stability, and sim-to-real transfer in RL tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

### [109] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of few-shot learning for food images, introducing the SPFF method to improve image classification by focusing on class-specific patches and enhancing performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the difficulty in accurately classifying food images due to their visual complexity and variability in presentation, lighting, and perspectives.

Method: The proposed method, SPFF, uses stochastic filtering to selectively focus on patch embeddings most correlated with class representation. A similarity matrix is utilized to quantify relationships between query and support images.

Result: The qualitative analysis shows that SPFF effectively identifies class-specific food features and removes irrelevant patches. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256 datasets.

Conclusion: SPFF enhances performance in few-shot learning tasks for food image classification by concentrating on the most informative image regions, addressing the issue of misclassification due to variability.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Conclusion: DINOv3 advances self-supervised learning by creating a versatile vision foundation model that works across diverse tasks and data types, offering scalable solutions for different resource demands and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single

realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a

art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various

description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an interpretable method for Oracle Bone Script (OBS) decipherment using Large Vision-Language Models to effectively connect the glyphs and their meanings, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and improving zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The OBS has historically been difficult to decipher due to its abstract, diverse pictographs. Current methods often neglect the detailed relationship between glyphs and their semantics, hindering interpretability and generalization, especially for zero-shot tasks.

Method: The authors propose a training strategy focusing on radical recognition and pictographic analysis. They employ a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism to enhance the model's decoding performance. A new dataset with over 47,000 annotated Chinese characters is introduced for training and analysis.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy and surpasses existing methods in zero-shot decipherment. It also provides logical analysis processes that could help with undeciphered OBS.

Conclusion: This research combines radical and pictographic analysis in a novel, interpretable framework, making substantial improvements in OBS decipherment while contributing to digital humanities and historical studies. The dataset and code are openly shared for further research.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

Motivation: To address the need for an accurate and efficient fiducial point placement method for TBDXA scans, facilitating body composition assessment and potential health insights.

Method: The study developed a deep learning model trained on 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans and applied it to different imaging modes. The model's accuracy was validated on external datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model is a reliable and efficient tool for TBDXA scan analysis, potentially aiding in health marker research. Resources including code and model weights are openly shared.

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) technique to improve multimodal fusion learning through explicit, interpretable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal fusion models struggle to effectively capture essential features of each modality and their complex correlations, impeding performance in comprehending multimodal inputs.

Method: The authors introduce the MANGO framework, incorporating an Invertible Cross-Attention (ICA) layer with three mechanisms—MMCA, IMCA, and LICA—to explicitly model and learn correlations in multimodal data. The framework is scalable for high-dimensional data.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal learning tasks: semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, and movie genre classification.

Conclusion: MANGO enhances multimodal learning by offering an interpretable and effective strategy for capturing complex modality correlations, achieving superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [115] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative AI models can create synthetic images for crop disease diagnosis. Combining synthetic and real images in the training process improves disease classification significantly, as shown in watermelon disease experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how synthetic images generated by GenAI can supplement real images in improving computer vision model performance, especially for crop disease diagnosis.

Method: Used EfficientNetV2-L with fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. Trained five dataset variations with different real-to-synthetic image ratios to evaluate the impact on classification.

Result: Models combining real and synthetic images (H2, H3, H4) achieved higher precision, recall, and F1-scores. Weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 to 1.00 when hybrid datasets were used.

Conclusion: Synthetic images alone are insufficient; combining them with a small number of real images is optimal for maximizing model performance and generalization.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [116] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using high-quality synthetic data to enhance the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) and object detectors in niche domains like industrial spill detection, addressing challenges posed by rare and sensitive real-world incident data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of VLMs and conventional detectors in safety-critical domains like industrial spill detection, where real-world data is scarce due to privacy and sensitivity concerns.

Method: The paper introduces a scalable framework using synthetic data (SynSpill dataset) for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models, enabling them to generalize better and improve detection performance.

Result: Using synthetic data boosts the performance of VLMs and object detectors, making them comparable and effective in detecting spills under rare and unseen scenarios, even outperforming conventional detectors without it.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data paired with lightweight adaptation provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for deploying vision systems in domains lacking real-world data, enhancing their applicability in industrial settings.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [117] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EntropyGS, an entropy coding method for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data, achieving substantial rate reduction while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address storage, transmission, and compression challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), as its Gaussian creation and view rendering tasks are often separate in time or devices.

Method: The paper first analyzes correlations and statistical properties of 3DGS Gaussian attributes, then proposes EntropyGS—a factorized and parameterized entropy coding method. Distribution parameters for each attribute are estimated and adaptive quantization is applied based on attribute types.

Result: EntropyGS achieves approximately 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining similar rendering quality to the original 3DGS data, with fast encoding and decoding speed.

Conclusion: EntropyGS provides an efficient and effective solution for 3DGS compression, enabling reduced data rates without compromising rendering quality.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in extracting robust cell-level features and integrating histology images with spatial transcriptomics data for better understanding of complex tumor tissues.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model-derived embeddings to fuse spatial gene expression data from Xenium transcriptomic profiles with morphological features from histology images at single-cell resolution.

Result: CellSymphony provides accurate cell type annotations and identifies distinct microenvironmental niches in three cancer types.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion and foundation models can effectively decipher cell physiology and phenotypic interactions in complex tissue ecosystems, emphasizing their potential in spatial transcriptomics-based studies.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Conclusion: Emerging trends, improved generalizability, and innovative datasets are reshaping crack detection technology. The introduction of 3DCrack contributes significantly to future research directions, enhancing both methodology and dataset diversity.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a decoding method, MRFD, to reduce factual hallucinations in large vision-language models without requiring model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often generate hallucinated text that is inconsistent with visual input due to limited inter-region verification abilities.

Method: The proposed training-free MRFD uses inter-region consistency via salient region identification, initial response generation, Jensen-Shannon Divergence-based reliability weights, and consistency-aware fusion through region-aware prompts.

Result: MRFD improves factual accuracy by reducing hallucinations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MRFD enhances factual grounding without modifying the models, improving the reliability of LVLMs for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [121] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation, focusing on improving robustness to individual differences and head pose variations through new calibration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance PoG estimation accuracy by overcoming limitations caused by individual variability and sensitivity to head pose variations in existing estimators, which necessitate person-specific calibration.

Method: The authors construct a benchmark dataset, MobilePoG, including facial images under varying head poses. They analyze calibration point and head pose diversity's impact on accuracy and propose a dynamic calibration method incorporating natural head pose variations during user calibration.

Result: Experiments show that wider head pose range during calibration improves handling of pose variation. The dynamic calibration strategy results in better PoG estimation accuracy and reduced sensitivity to head pose changes compared to conventional strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic calibration strategy offers a practical, user-friendly solution for pose-robust PoG estimation, advancing the effectiveness and generalizability of calibration processes.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [122] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance text-to-image generation using text-image contrastive constraints and structural guidance mechanisms, improving semantic alignment and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image generation methods face challenges in achieving accurate semantic alignment and maintaining structural consistency.

Method: The method integrates a contrastive learning module for cross-modal alignment and uses structural priors like semantic layout maps to guide spatial modeling. It jointly optimizes contrastive loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss under a multi-objective supervision scheme.

Result: Experiments on the COCO-2014 dataset show superior performance in CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, highlighting the method's ability to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity without adding computational complexity, providing a feasible solution for high-quality text-to-image generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

*Ryota Tanaka,Tomohiro Suzuki,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) framework for figure skating jumps, leveraging 3D pose data and procedural annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately identifying jump types and timings in figure skating is challenging due to the complexity and expert knowledge required.

Method: The approach includes View-Invariant, Figure Skating-Specific pose representation (VIFSS) and fine-grained annotations for jump phases using FS-Jump3D, a 3D figure skating pose dataset.

Result: Experiments show over 92% performance in F1@50 for element-level TAS, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: This framework improves TAS performance for figure skating jumps and demonstrates robustness with limited fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for visual reasoning often lack clarity in reasoning complexity, control over question difficulty, task customization, and structured step-by-step reasoning workflows.

Method: The researchers formalized reasoning complexity, developed an adaptive query engine to generate customizable questions of various difficulties, and extended the JRDB dataset to include enriched annotations.

Result: The outcomes included the creation of JRDB-Reasoning, which allows dynamic assessment and fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning models across multiple levels.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark provides a robust platform to better evaluate and enhance visual reasoning in AI systems, specifically targeting human-crowded scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new sub-pixel template matching method, PCWLAD, to improve multimodal optical image matching by addressing radiation and geometric deformation differences, achieving high accuracy across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the common challenges of nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences in multimodal optical images, which hinder accurate image matching.

Method: The proposed PCWLAD method involves two phases: coarse matching using the SSIM to preserve structural details and fine matching using WLAD with transformation models and mutual structure filtering to mitigate noise impacts.

Result: PCWLAD achieved superior performance compared to eight existing methods in terms of CMR and RMSE, with an average matching accuracy of approximately 0.4 pixels across three types of multimodal image datasets.

Conclusion: The study concludes that PCWLAD provides a significant improvement in multimodal optical image matching accuracy, demonstrating robust performance and practical usefulness across different datasets.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterSyn, a new framework for generating realistic interaction motions using interleaved learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous methods that treat solo and multi-person dynamics separately and fail to model natural dynamic interactions effectively.

Method: The framework uses an interleaved learning strategy with two modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis (INS) module and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module.

Result: InterSyn demonstrated higher text-to-motion alignment and greater diversity, outperforming existing methods in generating natural motion sequences.

Conclusion: InterSyn sets a new benchmark in motion synthesis, effectively capturing dynamic interactions, with plans to release the code to support future research.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of traditional OoD detection methods, which lack spatial localization, thereby enabling precise pixel-level segmentation crucial for applications such as autonomous driving.

Method: The paper categorizes current OoD segmentation methods into four main approaches: test-time OoD segmentation, supervised training with outlier exposure, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging powerful models. It systematically reviews these methods for autonomous-driving scenarios.

Result: The survey identifies recent advancements and categorizes methods for addressing OoD segmentation challenges in autonomous driving, providing a structured overview of the field.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for further research to address challenges and explore future opportunities in improving OoD segmentation, especially for its critical role in applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The survey explores reinforcement learning (RL) applications in visual content generation, highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing complex goals beyond traditional objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often fail to align synthesized visual content with perceptual quality, semantic accuracy, or physical realism, creating a need for alternate optimization strategies.

Method: The paper systematically reviews reinforcement learning's integration into generative tasks such as image, video, and 3D/4D content generation, examining its role in fine-tuning and structural alignment.

Result: RL demonstrates improved controllability, consistency, and alignment with human preferences in generative tasks across different visual domains.

Conclusion: RL presents a promising approach to generative modeling, but future research must address open challenges, including its scalability, efficiency, and applicability to broader tasks.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

*Andrew Bai,Justin Cui,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, proposing a targeted training data selection approach to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language benchmarks typically prioritize either visual concepts or visual skills; the paper aims to optimize performance by leveraging this dichotomy.

Method: Concepts and skills of benchmarks are extracted, categorized, and matched with instructions optimized for either conceptual knowledge or skill-based tasks.

Result: The proposed method improves benchmark performance by 0.9% on average across 10+ datasets and 1.5% on skill-focused subsets.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of targeted data selection in balancing conceptual knowledge and visual skill acquisition for better benchmark results.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

### [130] [Glo-DMU: A Deep Morphometry Framework of Ultrastructural Characterization in Glomerular Electron Microscopic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10351)
*Zhentai Zhang,Danyi Weng,Guibin Zhang,Xiang Chen,Kaixing Long,Jian Geng,Yanmeng Lu,Lei Zhang,Zhitao Zhou,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Glo-DMU, a framework based on deep learning models to automatically quantify key ultrastructural features of kidney biopsies with high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current computational pathology methods that focus on individual ultrastructure recognition, hindering practical diagnostic applications in kidney diseases.

Method: Developed a framework (Glo-DMU) using three deep learning models for segmentation, classification, and detection to quantify ultrastructural features of glomeruli: thickness of basement membrane, foot process effacement, and location of deposits.

Result: Evaluated on 115 patients across 9 renal pathological types, Glo-DMU showed strong consistency with pathological reports in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU provides a fully automated, precise, and efficient solution for ultrastructural analysis in renal biopsy diagnostics, enhancing support for pathologists.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

### [132] [AtomDiffuser: Time-Aware Degradation Modeling for Drift and Beam Damage in STEM Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10359)
*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses interpreting time-resolved STEM data hindered by spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss. It introduces AtomDiffuser, a model disentangling these degradation effects to track atomic-scale dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting time-resolved STEM data is challenging due to the simultaneous presence of spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss, which distort both geometry and intensity.

Method: The authors propose AtomDiffuser, a time-aware framework that models degradation by predicting affine transformations and spatially varying decay maps between STEM frames, leveraging synthetic training data.

Result: AtomDiffuser effectively generalizes to real-world cryo-STEM data, providing high-resolution insights into degradation patterns and alignment caused by radiation.

Conclusion: The method enables interpretable tracking of structural evolution in STEM, offering advanced visualization and quantification tools for material dynamics at atomic resolution.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpaRC-AD, a camera-radar fusion framework for autonomous driving, addressing limitations of vision-based systems in adverse conditions. It achieves significant improvements across detection, tracking, mapping, and planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of vision-based systems in end-to-end autonomous driving, particularly in adverse weather, occlusions, and precise velocity estimation, to improve safety in collision-critical scenarios.

Method: Proposed SpaRC-AD, a query-based camera-radar fusion framework utilizing sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation for robust motion understanding and trajectory planning.

Result: SpaRC-AD shows significant performance gains across tasks: 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2, -9% TPC) on benchmarks including nuScenes and Bench2Drive.

Conclusion: SpaRC-AD demonstrates the effectiveness of radar fusion for achieving spatial coherence and temporal consistency, especially in safety-critical scenarios requiring accurate motion understanding and long-horizon predictions.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Jose Manuel Jaén-Lorites,Jorge Vila-Tomás,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) for their alignment with human perception, focusing on low-level visual features like contrast sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how VLMs perceive low-level visual features and how closely this aligns with human vision, specifically using the contrast sensitivity function (CSF).

Method: Introduced a psychophysics-inspired method to estimate VLMs' CSF by testing their responses to visual stimuli (band-pass filtered noise images) at various contrasts and frequencies, with diverse prompts.

Result: Some VLMs show human-like CSF characteristics in either shape or magnitude, but none replicate both. Prompt phrasing greatly influences model responses, highlighting prompt instability.

Conclusion: The study provides a new framework for analyzing visual sensitivity in VLMs and identifies significant differences between their visual representations and human perception.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

### [135] [Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382)
*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to simultaneously generate images and their intrinsic properties (e.g., depth, segmentation maps), improving spatial consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent outputs due to limited understanding of underlying scene structures.

Method: The method extracts intrinsic scene properties using pre-trained estimators, aggregates them into a latent variable via an autoencoder, and enhances pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models to co-generate images and intrinsics.

Result: The approach corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces natural layouts while preserving the base model's fidelity and textual alignment.

Conclusion: Incorporating intrinsic scene properties enables improved spatial consistency and realism in image generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

*Yechan Kim,Dongho Yoon,Younkwan Lee,Unse Fatima,Hong Kook Kim,Songjae Lee,Sanga Park,Jeong Ho Park,Seonjong Kang,Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses subtle label noise in image segmentation by introducing NSegment+, a framework that uses decoupled image-label augmentations for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets suffer from implicit label noise, such as ambiguous boundaries and annotator variability, which impairs model generalization.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations to only the segmentation labels while maintaining the original images, enabling models to learn robust object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.

Result: NSegment+ improved mIoU scores on datasets like Vaihingen (+2.29), LoveDA (+2.38), Cityscapes (+1.75), and PASCAL VOC (+3.39). Performance further improved when integrated with techniques like CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses latent label noise in semantic segmentation, leading to consistent and amplified performance gains.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

*Haibin Sun,Xinghui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, PQ-DAF, for improving driver distraction detection via quality-controlled data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor generalization of existing models for driver distraction detection due to high annotation costs and domain shifts.

Method: The method uses a vision-language model for data filtering, Progressive Conditional Diffusion Models for pose-based data augmentation, and quality assessment modules for filtering low-quality synthetic data.

Result: PQ-DAF showed significant improvement in few-shot learning scenarios, demonstrating better model generalization and robustness across domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances driver distraction detection, especially in data-scarce environments, through efficient data augmentation and quality control.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

### [138] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to suppress undesired content in images generated by text-to-image diffusion models by modifying text embeddings and adapting them within cross-attention mechanisms, achieving noticeable improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating images but struggle with suppressing strongly entangled features associated with specific words (e.g., 'mustache' with 'Charlie Chaplin'). This paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The method introduces a delta vector to modify text embeddings, weakening influences of undesired content. It further uses Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) to integrate this change into the cross-attention mechanism, allowing more targeted suppression.

Result: The paper shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods significantly, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in suppressing undesired image content from generated outputs.

Conclusion: The method provides a novel and effective solution to the entanglement challenges in T2I diffusion models, enabling better control over generated content and advancing personalization capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

*Chaesong Park,Eunbin Seo,Jihyeon Hwang,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane is a novel 3D lane detection framework that combines slope-aware heightmap estimation and temporal consistency to improve robustness and accuracy on diverse road geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D lane detection struggle with fixed slope anchors and lack temporal consistency, leading to inaccuracies in diverse road conditions and across frames.

Method: SC-Lane uses a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module for dynamic slope-weight integration and a Height Consistency Module to ensure temporal coherence in height estimation.

Result: SC-Lane outperforms existing methods on the OpenLane benchmark, achieving an F-score of 64.3% and demonstrating better robustness in height estimation and 3D lane detection.

Conclusion: SC-Lane sets a new standard for 3D lane detection by effectively addressing slope diversity and temporal consistency, supported by state-of-the-art performance metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NanoControl, a lightweight framework for controllable text-to-image generation using Diffusion Transformers, which significantly minimizes computational overhead while maintaining top-tier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable text-to-image generation methods rely on the ControlNet paradigm designed for UNet-based models that lead to high computational and parameter requirements. The authors aim to create a more efficient alternative tailored to Diffusion Transformers.

Method: The authors propose NanoControl, which integrates a LoRA-style control module for learning control signals and introduces a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism to enhance conditional feature integration without duplicating the model backbone.

Result: NanoControl achieves state-of-the-art results in controllable text-to-image generation with only a minimal increase in parameter count (0.024%) and GFLOPs (0.029%), demonstrating superior computational efficiency and controllability.

Conclusion: NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead while ensuring high generation quality and precise controllability, marking it as an efficient alternative for Diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STRIDE-QA, a large-scale VQA dataset tailored for spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with spatiotemporal reasoning for dynamic traffic scenes due to limitations in their training data (static, web-sourced imagery).

Method: They constructed STRIDE-QA, a dataset from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data, featuring 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames with dense annotations to support complex reasoning tasks.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on STRIDE-QA led to significant performance improvements, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from existing VLMs.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a foundation for improving VLMs, making them more reliable for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

*Baichen Liu,Qi Lyu,Xudong Wang,Jiahua Dong,Lianqing Liu,Zhi Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CRISP, a method aimed at improving continual video instance segmentation by addressing confusions at the instance, category, and task levels with innovative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to tackle the challenges in continual video instance segmentation, which includes maintaining temporal consistency, learning new categories without forgetting previous ones, and resolving confusion at multiple levels (instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise).

Method: The authors introduced CRISP, which includes: (1) instance tracking and instance correlation loss to manage instance-wise learning; (2) adaptive residual semantic prompting with a residual prompt pool and query-prompt matching for category-wise learning; and (3) a novel initialization strategy for incremental prompts for task-wise learning.

Result: CRISP was evaluated on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets and demonstrated substantial improvements in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing segmentation and classification performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CRISP effectively addresses the challenges of continual video instance segmentation by introducing innovative solutions, achieving significant results on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive

### [143] [DOD-SA: Infrared-Visible Decoupled Object Detection with Single-Modality Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10445)
*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOD-SA, a framework enabling infrared-visible object detection with single-modality annotations, drastically reducing the need for dual-modality annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared-visible object detection methods require costly dual-modality annotations, so this paper aims to reduce annotation costs while maintaining robust detection performance.

Method: The proposed DOD-SA framework uses a Collaborative Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet) with single-modality and dual-modality decoupled branches, alongside a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST) and a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA).

Result: Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset show that DOD-SA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in infrared-visible object detection.

Conclusion: DOD-SA offers an effective solution for infrared-visible object detection with reduced annotation costs by leveraging cross-modal knowledge transfer and enhancing model decoupling capabilities.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

*Dhruv Dosi,Rohit Meena,Param Rajpura,Yogesh Kumar Meena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Legacy floor plans often exist as scanned documents, making them hard to analyze. This paper creates a dataset and tool for automatically detecting electrical symbols in plans, improving efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitizing legacy floor plans into a machine-readable format is crucial for efficient workflows and accurate interpretation in architecture and construction. Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone.

Method: The paper introduces the DELP dataset of annotated electrical layout plans and systematically benchmarks object detection models, with YOLOv8 demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, a toolkit called SkeySpot is developed for detecting and classifying electrical symbols in real-time.

Result: YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance with an 82.5% mean Average Precision (mAP) in detecting electrical symbols. SkeySpot extends this functionality into a practical toolkit for interpreting floor plans.

Conclusion: The approach democratizes electrical floor plan digitization, particularly for SMEs, by reducing reliance on costly proprietary systems and manual tasks. It promotes standardization, interoperability, and sustainability in the construction industry.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a bio-inspired architecture, PerceptNet, optimized for image reconstruction tasks, showing alignment with human perception without requiring supervised training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether human visual perception can emerge from image statistics and how efficient neural representations might be constructed to mimic early vision processes.

Method: The PerceptNet architecture, inspired by the retina-V1 cortex, was end-to-end trained for tasks like autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization.

Result: The encoder stage of PerceptNet demonstrated the highest correlation with human judgments on image distortions, optimized for moderate noise, blur, and sparsity.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired models like PerceptNet can potentially learn perceptual metrics without explicit human supervision, hinting that the visual system is adapted to remove specific distortion levels.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

### [146] [Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453)
*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TS-Mamba, a novel method for efficient video super-resolution (VSR) leveraging long-term trajectory modeling and state space models to enhance temporal alignment and reduce computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online VSR methods are limited by their reliance on only one previous frame for temporal alignment, restricting long-range temporal modeling. The paper aims to overcome this limitation while improving computational efficiency by leveraging state space models.

Method: The proposed method, TS-Mamba, uses long-term trajectory modeling to select similar tokens from previous frames and a TSMA module with shifted SSMs blocks to aggregate spatial and temporal information. It includes a trajectory-aware loss function for training.

Result: Extensive experiments on three VSR benchmarks show that TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance and reduces complexity by over 22.7% in MACs compared to six prior online VSR models.

Conclusion: TS-Mamba offers an effective solution for online VSR, demonstrating significant improvements in both performance and computational efficiency. The method establishes new benchmarks for efficiency and accuracy in the field.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome the domain shift challenge in plant species prediction when transitioning from single-species training images to multi-species testing images.

Method: The authors use a DINOv2 Vision Transformer with multi-classification heads, incorporating methods like multi-scale tiling, dynamic threshold optimization, and ensemble strategies.

Result: With 1.4 million training images across 7,806 species, the proposed approach ranks 3rd on the PlantCLEF 2025 private leaderboard, demonstrating strong performance.

Conclusion: The multi-head vision transformer approach effectively addresses the task and provides robust results. The code is publicly available for further exploration and use.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.
Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base
(ViT-B/14) backbone with multiple classification heads for species, genus, and
family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include
multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through
bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various
inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.
Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images
covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making

### [148] [SingleStrip: learning skull-stripping from a single labeled example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10464)
*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper combines domain randomization and self-training to train 3D skull-stripping models using minimal labeled data, showcasing results close to models trained with more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of volumetric images is laborious and time-consuming, and current methods for minimizing reliance on labeled data have limitations with anatomical variability or quality assessment of predicted labels.

Method: The proposed approach synthesizes training images via domain randomization from a single labeled example, uses an autoencoder to assess quality of pseudo-labels, and selects high-quality ones for fine-tuning in a semi-supervised framework.

Result: The combined strategy achieves near-parity with models trained on significantly more labeled images and demonstrates stronger correlation between AE-based ranking and segmentation accuracy compared to consistency-based ranking.

Conclusion: The study shows that combining domain randomization with autoencoder-driven quality control is a promising method to reduce the dependency on labeled data for medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

*Maimunatu Tunau,Vincent Gbouna Zakka,Zhuangzhuang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and compares three popular methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering), as well as their combinations, for improving the quality of mmWave radar data in Human Action Recognition (HAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find a privacy-preserving alternative to vision-based HAR systems by improving the processing of sparse and noisy mmWave radar data.

Method: The paper evaluates and enhances three data processing methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering) individually, in pairs, and all combined, using the MiliPoint dataset to assess recognition accuracy and computational cost.

Result: It provides a detailed analysis of the strengths, trade-offs, and areas for improvement for the methods and their combinations, with proposed targeted enhancements.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable insights to guide the development of improved and privacy-conscious mmWave radar-based HAR systems.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

*Liangrui Pan,xiaoyu Li,Guang Zhu,Guanting Li,Ruixin Wang,Jiadi Luo,Yaning Yang,Liang qingchun,Shaoliang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAMP, a deep learning framework for diagnosing Spread through Air Spaces (STAS) in lung adenocarcinoma using multi-center histopathological image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current STAS diagnosis in lung adenocarcinoma is labor-intensive and prone to errors, necessitating the adoption of automated deep learning solutions.

Method: STAMP employs a multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework with a dual-branch architecture and transformer-based encoding. Key innovations include attention aggregation modules and similarity regularization constraints.

Result: STAMP demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, achieving AUCs over 0.79 across three separate datasets, surpassing clinical benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach shows promising results in STAS diagnosis with the potential to improve clinical workflows and diagnostic reliability through automation.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a new method for efficient, consistent image editing using pre-trained diffusion models without requiring tuning or inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of over-alignment with prompts and poor preservation of source image semantics in existing text-guided image editing methods.

Method: It introduces a framework that regularizes the entire denoising process using a consistency model and gradient-driven regularization, avoiding reliance on inversion anchors.

Result: The framework achieves better semantic preservation and target alignment than existing methods, completing edits in only 12 steps, making it highly efficient.

Conclusion: TweezeEdit proves to be an effective and fast approach for image editing, showing potential for real-time applications.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

*Zheng Zhou,Jia-Chen Zhang,Yu-Jie Xiong,Chun-Ming Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves 3D Gaussian splatting for real-time view synthesis by introducing multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric constraints to enhance fine detail preservation and reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian splatting often fails to reconstruct fine details and textures in regions with high-frequency elements, leading to blurred visual reconstructions.

Method: The framework combines MSAA to reduce aliasing artifacts with two geometric constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed areas and gradient differential constraints for object boundaries, dynamically optimizing key regions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, with improvements in SSIM and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining real-time rendering efficiency.

Conclusion: The integration of MSAA and dual geometric constraints enables sharper, more detailed 3D scene reconstruction, addressing high-frequency texture challenges without sacrificing real-time capability.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

*Yangjie Xiao,Ke Zhang,Jiacun Wang,Xin Sheng,Yurong Guo,Meijuan Chen,Zehua Ren,Zhaoye Zheng,Zhenbing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SBDE, a novel method for enhancing bolt defect detection via segmentation-driven dataset augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in bolt defect detection caused by scarce defect images and imbalanced data distributions.

Method: It introduces SBDE using the Bolt-SAM segmentation model, MOD-LaMa for defect attribute editing, and an Editing Recovery Augmentation (ERA) strategy for dataset expansion.

Result: SBDE-generated defect images significantly outperform state-of-the-art models, positively impacting defect detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed SBDE method effectively augments datasets for bolt defect detection, showcasing strong application potential.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for estimating human dance motion using both egocentric video and music inputs, leveraging diffusion models and a Skeleton Mamba framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the largely unexplored task of jointly estimating human dance motion using both egocentric video and music inputs, given challenges like obscured body views and synchronization with music.

Method: The paper presents EgoAIST++, a large-scale dataset, and proposes the EgoMusic Motion Network with Skeleton Mamba to capture human body skeleton structures accurately.

Result: Their method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes well to real-world scenarios based on intensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach with its dataset and network design establishes a significant advancement in estimating human dance motion from dual inputs of video and music, contributing to industrial applications.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing surveys in visual reasoning consider isolated aspects like relational or causal reasoning, neglecting an integrated analysis across all reasoning types and methodologies.

Method: The paper categorizes visual reasoning into five types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, commonsense), reviews relevant architectures (e.g., graph-based models, neuro-symbolic systems), and critiques current evaluation protocols.

Result: It highlights key challenges like scalability, dataset limitations, and issues with symbolic-neural integration, along with proposing directions for advancing visual reasoning.

Conclusion: A unified approach to visual reasoning is essential for developing transparent, trustworthy, and adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale dataset for medical image grounding, and Med-GLIP, a modality-aware framework that improves grounding accuracy and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome constraints in existing research such as limited modalities, coarse annotations, and the lack of a generalizable grounding framework in medical image grounding tasks.

Method: The authors created Med-GLIP-5M with 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities and proposed Med-GLIP, a framework trained on this dataset that implicitly learns hierarchical semantics without requiring expert-designed modules.

Result: Med-GLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and significantly enhances downstream tasks like medical VQA and automated report generation.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework advance medical image grounding and facilitate improvements in related applications; the dataset will be publicly released soon.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

### [157] [GCRPNet: Graph-Enhanced Contextual and Regional Perception Network For Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10542)
*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The researchers introduce GCRPNet, a model for salient object detection in remote sensing images that uses innovative modules for better multi-scale feature integration and regional enhancement. It outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in salient object detection for optical remote sensing images, such as scale variations and poor target-background contrast, and improve the integration of global and local features.

Method: The researchers propose GCRPNet, which utilizes a visual state space encoder for multi-scale feature extraction, a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module for cross-layer interaction, and the LEVSS block with adaptive scanning and attention enhancement for decoding.

Result: The proposed GCRPNet delivers state-of-the-art performance as demonstrated by extensive experimental results.

Conclusion: The GCRPNet model effectively addresses the identified challenges, improving optical remote sensing image analysis and outperforming existing detection methods.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

### [158] [PSScreen: Partially Supervised Multiple Retinal Disease Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10549)
*Boyi Zheng,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen is a novel partially supervised model for multiple retinal disease screening. It addresses domain shifts across datasets and missing labels using feature alignment, pseudo-label consistency, and self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on fully annotated datasets for retinal disease screening and address challenges posed by dataset domain shifts and partially labeled data.

Method: The proposed approach uses a dual-stream architecture: one for deterministic features and one for probabilistic features. It integrates uncertainty injection, feature distillation guided by textual alignment, pseudo-label consistency, and self-distillation to enhance detection performance.

Result: PSScreen demonstrates enhanced detection performance across six retinal diseases on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: PSScreen effectively tackles partial labeling and domain shift challenges, setting a new benchmark for partially supervised retinal disease screening models.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

### [159] [AR Surgical Navigation With Surface Tracing: Comparing In-SitVisualization with Tool-Tracking Guidance for Neurosurgical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10554)
*Marc J. Fischer,Jeffrey Potts,Gabriel Urreola,Dax Jones,Paolo Palmisciano,E. Bradley Strong,Branden Cord,Andrew D. Hernandez,Julia D. Sharma,E. Brandon Strong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving AR navigation in surgery by addressing depth perception and occlusion challenges. It proposes a novel real-time tool-tracking guidance method using HoloLens 2 and demonstrated its superiority over static visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance surgical precision by addressing shortcomings in current AR navigation systems, especially depth perception and occlusion handling, to improve intraoperative guidance.

Method: The paper introduces a novel AR tool-tracking system for real-time catheter placement, using HoloLens 2 sensors. Two AR guidance modes were tested: static visualization and real-time guidance.

Result: Real-time tool-tracking outperformed static visualization across accuracy measures, showing reduced target deviation, angular error, and higher user preference.

Conclusion: The methodology promises to advance AR surgical navigation by improving accuracy and usability, making real-time tool tracking superior to static guidance.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

### [160] [Retrieval-Augmented Prompt for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10556)
*Ruisong Han,Zongbo Han,Jiahao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP), a novel method for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in machine learning that uses external knowledge to improve semantic supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods face challenges due to limited semantic supervision, often relying on auxiliary outliers or in-distribution samples that do not effectively match real test OOD data.

Method: RAP enhances a pre-trained vision-language model with prompts augmented by retrieved external knowledge. It dynamically updates these prompts during training and testing using descriptive words sourced from external textual knowledge.

Result: RAP achieves state-of-the-art results in large-scale OOD benchmarks, such as reducing FPR95 by 7.05% and improving AUROC by 1.71% in 1-shot OOD detection on ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RAP offers a significant advancement in OOD detection by leveraging external knowledge for semantic supervision, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

### [161] [PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557)
*Xinhao Wang,Zhiwei Lin,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTQAT, a hybrid quantization algorithm combining Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for efficient 3D perception model deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-offs between PTQ's performance degradation and QAT's high GPU and training demands for 3D perception networks.

Method: PTQAT selectively applies QAT fine-tuning to layers with smaller quantization discrepancies, performing PTQ on the rest. This prioritization compensates errors during propagation rather than at the source.

Result: PTQAT achieves performance on par or superior to QAT with reduced computational demands, supporting various bit widths and architectures, and improves metrics like NDS, mAP, and mIoU in 3D perception tasks.

Conclusion: PTQAT effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in model quantization, offering a scalable solution for diverse architectures and tasks.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

### [162] [HM-Talker: Hybrid Motion Modeling for High-Fidelity Talking Head Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10566)
*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HM-Talker, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head video generation, addressing issues like motion blur and lip jitter by combining implicit and explicit motion cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in talking head video generation lack explicit articulatory priors, leading to poor performance in resolving issues like lip jitter and motion blur.

Method: HM-Talker uses a hybrid motion representation integrating Action Units (AUs) as explicit cues and implicit motion features. The Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) extracts and aligns these cues, while the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM) enhances generalization by fusing features dynamically.

Result: HM-Talker achieves high-quality, temporally coherent talking head videos with improved lip synchronization and adaptability across identities.

Conclusion: The proposed method sets a new benchmark in talking head video generation by combining anatomical guidance and implicit modeling, with notable gains in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the success of foundational models like SAM for the domain of remote sensing change detection, which requires robust analysis across varying scales and datasets.

Method: Fine-tuning the SAM encoder with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE), multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF), and a new cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss for class imbalance handling.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 2.5% improvement in F1-score on the complex S2Looking dataset and outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four datasets.

Conclusion: Adapting foundational models with targeted enhancements can significantly improve performance in specialized tasks like remote sensing change detection.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,
Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on
a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at:

*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Modal Agent, a flexible, adaptive system for Referring-based Video Object Segmentation (RVOS and Ref-AVS tasks), using reasoning capabilities of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Referring-based Video Object Segmentation methods involve high computation and manual annotation. Vision-language foundation models present a training-free alternative.

Method: The Multi-Modal Agent creates dynamic workflows using large language model reasoning, employing specialized tools across modalities for iterative task-solving.

Result: The proposed agent improves performance on multimodal-conditioned video object segmentation tasks, compared to fixed pipeline methods.

Conclusion: The adaptive agentic system outperforms previous methods, showcasing its ability to address dynamic segmentation tasks effectively.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

*Zheng Qin,Ruobing Zheng,Yabing Wang,Tianqi Li,Yi Yuan,Jingdong Chen,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark called HumanSense to evaluate and improve Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for human-centered scenarios. The study finds that MLLMs need significant advances, particularly in reasoning abilities, and showcases methods for improving their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs hold the potential for human-like interactions, but their development is hindered by the absence of fine-grained evaluation frameworks to assess their understanding of human intentions and ability to provide empathetic interactions.

Method: The paper develops the HumanSense benchmark to assess MLLMs on extended multimodal contexts. It uses multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning abilities and introduces training-free methods to improve non-reasoning models through tailored prompts.

Result: HumanSense reveals that MLLMs still struggle with advanced interaction tasks, but incorporating audio, text, and visual data significantly enhances their performance. Omni-modal models perform better on human-centered evaluations, and reasoning abilities show clear thought pattern consistency.

Conclusion: Improving reasoning abilities is key for MLLMs to provide better human-centric responses. The paper's methodologies, including employing reinforcement learning and prompt design, offer effective pathways for boosting model performance in multimodal interactions.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvTurb, a framework using high-speed event streams to tackle atmospheric turbulence degradations like blur and tilt in images, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges posed by atmospheric turbulence, which degrades image quality and affects downstream computer vision tasks.

Method: EvTurb uses event streams to decouple blur and tilt distortions through a two-step network: event integrals for blur reduction and variance maps for tilt elimination.

Result: EvTurb outperforms state-of-the-art models in both turbulence correction and computational efficiency, with supporting evidence from the new TurbEvent dataset.

Conclusion: EvTurb demonstrates the effectiveness of event-guided approaches in solving turbulence-induced distortions, offering a notable advancement in image restoration under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

*Yuxin Cao,Yedi Zhang,Wentao He,Yifan Liao,Yan Xiao,Chang Li,Zhiyong Huang,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces P$^3$A, a novel black-box attack framework to enhance the effectiveness and transferability of adversarial patches in autonomous driving systems, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patches pose serious risks to learning-based autonomous driving systems, but existing black-box attacks overestimate their effectiveness and lack scalability to high-resolution datasets.

Method: The authors propose P$^3$A, which includes (1) a new metric, Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), (2) Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) for improved transferability, and (3) Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) for high-resolution data handling.

Result: P$^3$A achieves better attack success rates on unseen models and datasets, outperforming prior methods in both practical IoU-based and traditional mAP-based metrics.

Conclusion: This framework addresses critical limitations of prior black-box attacks, enhancing robustness and transferability in autonomous driving vulnerability analysis.

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), an enhanced upsampling module for single image super-resolution that effectively reconstructs high-frequency details and minimizes artifacts. It shows consistent improvement in performance and spectral fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsampling methods like Sub-Pixel Convolution often fail to recover high-frequency details accurately and introduce aliasing artifacts in single image super-resolution tasks.

Method: The proposed method, Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), consists of a Fourier feature-based MLP for positional frequency encoding, a Correlation Attention Layer for adaptive alignment, and a frequency-domain L1 loss for maintaining spectral fidelity. It adds only 0.3M parameters to the model.

Result: FGA improves performance by 0.12~0.14 dB in PSNR across tested super-resolution models and increases frequency-domain consistency by up to 29%, particularly on texture-rich datasets.

Conclusion: FGA proves to be an effective and scalable alternative to traditional upsampling techniques, reducing aliasing while preserving fine details, suitable for both lightweight and full-capacity use scenarios.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FIND-Net, a dual-domain framework tackling CT metal artifacts via frequency and spatial processing, surpassing earlier MAR methods in artifact removal and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the persistent issue of metal artifacts in CT imaging that compromise image quality, making diagnosis and treatment challenging.

Method: FIND-Net combines Fourier-based frequency domain layers and spatial dictionary-based filtering, utilizing a hybrid MAR approach targeting artifacts while preserving anatomical clarity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate FIND-Net's superior performance: 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR improvement over leading MAR methods, verified on synthetic and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: FIND-Net offers enhanced artifact suppression and preserves anatomical details effectively, showcasing its practical value in clinical CT imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

Motivation: Current conditional image generative models often exhibit a trade-off between generation quality and diversity, limiting their utility as a source of synthetic training data. Additionally, utility functions in guidance methods typically overlook potential distribution shifts between synthetic and real data.

Method: Chamfer Guidance is proposed as a training-free guidance approach that uses exemplar real images to measure and optimize the quality and diversity of synthetic data effectively.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance on benchmarks, with significant gains in precision (up to 97.5%) and distributional coverage (up to 92.7%) using only 32 real images. It also enhances classifier performance on synthetic data, with accuracy boosts up to 16% for out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance successfully improves the utility of synthetic data for training, while reducing computational costs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChatENV, a vision-language model that integrates satellite imagery and environmental sensor data for temporal and interactive reasoning, achieving strong performance in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance environmental monitoring by addressing limitations in current vision-language models (VLMs), including the neglect of causal sensor signals, a reliance on single-source stylistic captions, and limited interactive reasoning capabilities.

Method: The approach involves creating a large dataset of satellite image pairs with sensor metadata, annotating these with GPT-4 and Gemini 2.0 for diversity, and fine-tuning the Qwen-2.5-VL model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for conversational use.

Result: ChatENV performs strongly in temporal and hypothetical reasoning tasks (e.g., achieving a BERT-F1 score of 0.903) and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art temporal models.

Conclusion: ChatENV is positioned as a robust, sensor-aware tool for environmental monitoring, capable of grounded and interactive scenario analysis that supports climate resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

*Ryan Ramos,Vladan Stojnić,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Yuta Nakashima,Giorgos Tolias,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how visual encoders respond to subtle, often imperceptible changes in image acquisition and processing parameters, finding these can significantly impact semantic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past research has explored encoder robustness to noticeable image corruptions and transformation-induced test-time distribution shifts, which degrade performance. This study examines less obvious changes that might still affect semantic prediction.

Method: The authors analyze how parameters linked to image acquisition and processing are embedded in visual representations, studying their recoverability and influence on prediction tasks.

Result: The research reveals that these parameters are systematically encoded in visual representations and significantly affect semantic outcomes depending on correlations with semantic labels.

Conclusion: Even subtle image acquisition or transformation parameters can materially influence the outputs of visual encoders, emphasizing the need for careful design and understanding in model training and deployment.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

*Helena Russello,Rik van der Tol,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method combining pose estimation and BLSTM neural networks to achieve 85% accuracy in classifying cow lameness using video-based keypoint trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve lameness detection in cows by eliminating manual feature engineering using markerless pose estimation and learning temporal motion features.

Method: Keypoints from cow motion sequences are extracted using the T-LEAP pose estimation model. These trajectories are input into a BLSTM classifier for binary classification of lameness.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional feature-based approaches, achieving 85% accuracy compared to 80%, and demonstrated effectiveness using just one second of video data.

Conclusion: The approach is more efficient and effective for detecting cow lameness, leveraging short video sequences and smaller training datasets.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) to improve unseen category transferability in Vision-Language Models via attribute-level semantic knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between category-specific representation preservation and acquiring transferable knowledge makes unseen category transfer in Vision-Language Models challenging.

Method: SemPT involves extracting shared visual attributes via a two-step prompting strategy, generating attribute-level descriptions, applying visually guided weighting to reduce irrelevant information, and dynamically adapting embeddings based on category exposure.

Result: SemPT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 15 datasets in tasks such as unseen category generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: By leveraging shared visual semantic cues and dynamically adapting to category exposure, SemPT enhances generalization ability, offering a robust solution for unseen category transfer challenges in Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

*Zhangyong Tang,Tianyang Xu,Xuefeng Zhu,Chunyang Cheng,Tao Zhou,Xiaojun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on creating a unified benchmark and process for multi-modal visual object tracking, aiming to overcome inconsistencies between training and testing and promoting better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inconsistency between training and testing in multi-modal visual object tracking, which causes performance degradation, by unifying data and benchmarks.

Method: The authors introduce a unified benchmark called UniBench300 and reformulate the unification process in a serial format, integrating continual learning to reduce knowledge forgetting and improve stability.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that UniBench300 reduces inference passes, cuts inference time by 27%, and improves the unification process. Continual learning is shown to significantly enhance stability, with performance degradation negatively correlated with network capacity.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that UniBench300 and continual learning can effectively unify multi-modal visual object tracking tasks, providing stable and efficient solutions. Future research should consider network capacity and modality discrepancies when expanding the approach.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

*Shixiong Xu,Chenghao Zhang,Lubin Fan,Yuan Zhou,Bin Fan,Shiming Xiang,Gaofeng Meng,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AddressVLM, a model for urban address localization via street-view and satellite images, showing over 9% and 12% accuracy improvements in Pittsburgh and San Francisco datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large visual language models (LVLMs) excel in coarse-grained geo-localization but are inadequate for fine-grained, street-level address localization within cities. There is a need for a model capable of flexible address-related VQA using street-view images.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage training model called AddressVLM. It integrates perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and uses cross-view alignment tuning methods, including a satellite-view and street-view image grafting mechanism and an automatic label generation mechanism.

Result: AddressVLM demonstrates an over 9% and 12% average improvement in address localization accuracy across Pittsburgh and San Francisco datasets compared to existing LVLM counterparts.

Conclusion: The integration of satellite and street-view image cues enhances fine-grained geo-localization in LVLMs, establishing AddressVLM as a robust model for urban address localization.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for constructing a high-quality, diverse face dataset for training face recognition models, achieving 1st place in the DataCV ICCV Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of building a high-quality face dataset that does not overlap with existing public datasets while ensuring diversity and effectiveness for training face recognition models.

Method: The approach starts with cleaning the HSFace dataset using a Mixture-of-Experts strategy combining clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification. It applies data augmentation, uses Stable Diffusion for synthetic data generation, expands synthetic images with Vec2Face, and employs a curriculum learning strategy to train models progressively.

Result: The constructed dataset, with 50 images per identity and verified for no identity leakage, improves model performance across identity scales of 10K, 20K, and 100K, and wins 1st place in the DataCV ICCV Challenge.

Conclusion: The hybrid method of dataset construction, blending GAN and diffusion models alongside strategic learning, is effective for creating high-performance face recognition datasets, demonstrating superior results in scalability and model training.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

*Zhaoyuan Qi,Weihua Gao,Wenlong Niu,Jie Tang,Yun Li,Xiaodong Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperTea, a novel framework for moving infrared small target detection that improves temporal correlations by integrating CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in moving infrared small target detection caused by small target sizes, weak intensities, complex motion patterns, and limitations of low-order correlation modeling in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose HyperTea, incorporating global and local temporal enhancement modules (GTEM and LTEM) for temporal context enhancement, along with a temporal alignment module (TAM) to manage cross-scale feature misalignment. It combines CNNs, RNNs, and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for multi-timescale feature representation.

Result: HyperTea outperforms previous methods on DAUB and IRDST datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in moving infrared small target detection.

Conclusion: HyperTea effectively models high-order spatiotemporal correlations and demonstrates significant advancements in moving infrared small target detection. Its open-source implementation is available for further exploration.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for fetal brain MRI T2 mapping at 0.55T to combat motion corruption and reduce scan time by employing joint reconstruction leveraging physics-informed regularization and implicit neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the characterization of the developing fetal brain at mid-field MRI, where slower T2 decay provides an opportunity, but motion corruption and long scan times present challenges.

Method: The authors propose a joint reconstruction method across echo times using implicit neural representations combined with physics-informed T2 decay regularization for motion correction and anatomical fidelity.

Result: The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and adult datasets with similar motion challenges, and it showcases in vivo fetal T2 mapping capabilities at 0.55T.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of reducing scan repetitions in fetal T2 mapping by exploiting anatomical redundancy and addressing motion-related issues effectively.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance industrial quality inspection by addressing the limitations of existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in anomaly detection, particularly their lack of industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Method: IADGPT features a three-stage progressive training strategy, leveraging in-context learning for novel product generalization. Added innovations include pixel and image-level anomaly score calculation using logits and attention maps, supported by a new dataset.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements in anomaly detection, localization, and reasoning across diverse industrial product categories.

Conclusion: IADGPT effectively mimics human-like capabilities in FS-IAD, improving automation in industrial quality inspections with a specialized dataset and robust anomaly detection methodology.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework for synthesizing novel views from a single image by leveraging pretrained diffusion models and a novel fusion strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for novel view synthesis are computationally expensive, produce blurry reconstructions, and lack generalization capabilities.

Method: The approach uses DDIM-inverted latents of an input image and a camera pose-conditioned TUNet for latent prediction. A novel fusion strategy is then applied to improve texture and detail preservation.

Result: The method outperforms existing techniques on the MVImgNet dataset in terms of reconstruction quality and detail preservation.

Conclusion: By combining a pretrained diffusion model's generative prior with an explicit translation framework and innovative fusion strategy, the paper achieves superior performance and efficiency in novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFNet integrates a bio-inspired event camera and an RGB camera for improved object detection in challenging lighting conditions using spatiotemporal alignment and feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional RGB cameras in complex traffic environments with poor lighting or fast motion, which degrade object detection accuracy.

Method: MCFNet utilizes three key modules: an Event Correction Module (ECM) for temporal alignment, an Event Dynamic Upsampling Module (EDUM) for spatial resolution enhancement, and a Cross-Modal Mamba Fusion Module (CMM) for feature fusion.

Result: MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets, achieving a 7.4% improvement in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics on the DSEC-Det dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating bio-inspired event cameras with RGB cameras and employing advanced fusion techniques offers a superior solution for object detection in complex lighting scenarios.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "CountCluster," a method to improve the accuracy of object counts in images generated by diffusion-based text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with accurately reflecting the specified number of objects in input prompts during text-to-image generation.

Method: The authors propose "CountCluster," which clusters the object cross-attention map into regions based on the input count during inference, aligns these clusters with a spatially separated ideal distribution, and optimizes the latent representation.

Result: CountCluster improves object count accuracy by an average of 18.5% compared to existing methods, showcasing superior performance in quantity control across diverse prompts.

Conclusion: The method advances the ability of diffusion-based image generation models to accurately represent object quantities, addressing limitations without external tools or additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

*Alexandre Brown,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SegDAC, a reinforcement learning method that uses object-centric segmentation and semantic grounding to improve visual generalization and sample efficiency in high-dimensional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrate powerful perception models effectively into RL to improve visual generalization and sample efficiency in high-dimensional scenarios.

Method: SegDAC employs SAM for object segmentation and YOLO-World for semantic grounding using text prompts, coupled with a transformer-based architecture to focus dynamically on key segments during reinforcement learning.

Result: SegDAC achieves notable improvements, doubling prior performance on difficult visual generalization benchmarks and surpassing previous methods in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: SegDAC represents a promising direction for enhancing RL in high-dimensional visual environments, emphasizing object-centric decomposition and dynamic focus.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Motivation: Address limitations of current autoregressive models in text-to-image generation that depend on heavy diffusion models or incur quantization loss using vector quantization.

Method: Develop NextStep-1, a large autoregressive model coupled with a flow matching head, trained with next-token prediction objectives on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens.

Result: NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation and demonstrates strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis and image editing.

Conclusion: NextStep-1 advances autoregressive text-to-image generation by combining discrete text tokens with continuous image tokens, offering improved synthesis and editing capabilities while sharing code and models for community benefit.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward
with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching
head, training on discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens with
next-token prediction objectives. NextStep-1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance for autoregressive models in text-to-image generation tasks,
exhibiting strong capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. Furthermore,
our method shows strong performance in image editing, highlighting the power
and versatility of our unified approach. To facilitate open research, we will

*Fabian Kresse,Georgios Pilikos,Mario Azcueta,Nicolas Floury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes neural networks for real-time on-board SAR processing and demonstrates classification capabilities between ships and windmills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAR data analysis involves extensive ground processing, causing latency issues and bandwidth constraints. On-board processing could mitigate these issues but requires optimized methods for resource-limited satellite systems.

Method: The authors designed neural networks for real-time inference directly on unfocused SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellites, and tested their feasibility for FPGA deployment.

Result: Results showed the designed neural networks successfully process SAR data onboard and perform binary classification tasks, distinguishing between ships and windmills.

Conclusion: On-board SAR data processing using neural networks is feasible, reducing bandwidth and latency limitations while enabling real-time maritime monitoring.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [187] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses cross-view localization using a novel framework for improved image matching and localization between ground and aerial views. It proposes new components like the Surface Model and SimRefiner module for better performance and introduces the CVFM benchmark dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing cross-view localization methods, which fail to establish fine-grained cross-view correspondences and yield geometrically inconsistent matches. The goal is to enhance localization accuracy in scenarios like urban canyons and disaster zones.

Method: The paper introduces a Surface Model for accurate BEV projection and a SimRefiner module to refine similarity matrices without post-processing. Additionally, it provides the CVFM benchmark dataset for research in pixel-level cross-view image matching.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy and image matching quality. The CVFM dataset sets new benchmarks for addressing extreme viewpoint disparities.

Conclusion: Revisiting cross-view localization from an image-matching perspective leads to meaningful advancements in matching accuracy and localization interpretability. The introduced methods and dataset lay new groundwork for research in cross-view localization.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

*Longxiang Tang,Ruihang Chu,Xiang Wang,Yujin Han,Pingyu Wu,Chunming He,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCPE, a method to improve token similarity extraction for autoregressive image generation systems, addressing issues in k-means clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive generative models miss exploiting the rich token similarity information embedded in codebooks, as k-means clustering used for codebook reduction has performance issues.

Method: The proposed DCPE uses instance-based distances instead of centroid-based ones and applies agglomerative merging to address token space disparities for enhanced token similarity extraction.

Result: DCPE accelerates training by 42% and improves FID and IS performance on LlamaGen-B, demonstrating superior token similarity utilization.

Conclusion: DCPE effectively improves the training efficiency and end performance of autoregressive image generation by better leveraging codebook priors.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoCross, a benchmark to evaluate the cross-domain generalization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Egocentric Video Question Answering (EgocentricQA) across challenging domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EgocentricQA studies have primarily focused on daily activities like cooking and cleaning, limiting real-world applicability. This paper aims to address the domain shift encountered in practical scenarios.

Method: EgoCross is a benchmark dataset spanning four challenging domains: surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspective. It contains around 1,000 QA pairs over 798 video clips, covering prediction, recognition, localization, and counting tasks in both OpenQA and CloseQA formats.

Result: Experiments show that existing MLLMs perform poorly in cross-domain settings, exposing their limitations. Fine-tuning and reinforcement learning pilot studies highlight possible paths for improvement.

Conclusion: EgoCross offers a comprehensive testing ground for domain-adaptive egocentric video understanding, encouraging future work toward robust, cross-domain MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be
released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConGCD introduces a novel human-inspired framework for generalized category discovery, focusing on decomposing visual primitives and integrating diverse human-like preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine learning frameworks and generalized category discovery by mimicking human cognitive processes in understanding novel objects.

Method: The proposed ConGCD model uses visual primitive decomposition, semantic reconstruction, and consensus units for capturing class-discriminative and invariant distributional cues.

Result: Evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness in generalized category discovery tasks.

Conclusion: ConGCD offers a robust and consensus-aware approach to emulate human-like object understanding, advancing generalized category discovery performance.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

TL;DR: The 2025 SSBC compared sclera segmentation models trained on synthetic and mixed datasets. Results indicated competitive performance for synthetic-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore privacy-preserving sclera-segmentation models and assess synthetic data’s effectiveness compared to real-world datasets.

Method: Two competition tracks were devised: one using only synthetic data and another using mixed synthetic and limited real-world data. Nine teams competed using diverse architectural approaches on three evaluation datasets.

Result: Synthetic-data models achieved high $F_1$ scores (>0.8). Methodology outweighed real-data inclusion in performance gains for the mixed track.

Conclusion: Synthetic data is promising for privacy-aware biometric development, as evident in competitive segmentation performance across tracks.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

*Wongyun Yu,Ahyun Seo,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for precision detection of reflection and rotation symmetry in complex scenes using a dual-branch architecture with dihedral group-equivariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry axes in complex scenes is challenging, as traditional heatmap-based methods lack precision in pinpointing individual axes.

Method: The proposed dual-branch framework is dihedral group-equivariant, employing specialized branches for reflection and rotation detection, and leveraging geometrical primitives like lines and points for axis-level identification.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in symmetry detection.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling reflectional and rotational symmetry as geometric primitives, this framework sets a new benchmark for precision in symmetry axis detection.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

*Lixin Jia,Zhiqing Guo,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) strategy and Dual Perception Network (DPNet) to improve the generalization and effectiveness of deepfake detection, especially against unknown forgery techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor cross-dataset performance of current deepfake detection methods and their ineffectiveness in handling fast-evolving and unknown forgery techniques.

Method: The authors propose FGL to dynamically adapt detection networks to unknown forgery types, alongside a DPNet that captures forgery differences and relationships through frequency and spatial analysis, with graph convolution to understand feature correlations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios and effectively detects unknown forgeries.

Conclusion: The presented FGL strategy and DPNet significantly enhance generalization and robustness in deepfake detection, addressing critical challenges posed by rapidly evolving forgery techniques.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARC, a model-driven method for atlas construction in medical image analysis, which overcomes scalability and optimization issues while providing high anatomical fidelity and versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of data-driven registration approaches, like need for large datasets and limited generalizability, and the scalability issues of traditional model-driven methods in atlas construction.

Method: The DARC framework uses a coordinate descent strategy and a centrality-enforcing activation function to construct unbiased, diffeomorphic atlases using model-driven groupwise registration. It supports diverse dissimilarity metrics and large numbers of 3D images efficiently.

Result: DARC produces high-fidelity atlases and demonstrates strong performance in tasks like one-shot segmentation, outperforming existing few-shot methods, and shape synthesis by generating anatomical variants.

Conclusion: DARC is a scalable, efficient, and generalizable tool for high-quality atlas construction with additional applications like segmentation and shape synthesis in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and improves the spatio-physical reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs), but highlights remaining limitations in generalizing to unseen physics scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the spatio-physical reasoning abilities of vision-language models, a critical step for better real-world understanding.

Method: The paper uses supervised fine-tuning followed by rule-based reinforcement learning on Qwen2.5-VL-7B to enhance spatio-physical reasoning.

Result: The modified model achieved noticeable improvements in spatio-physical reasoning and outperformed leading proprietary models.

Conclusion: While fine-tuning methods enhanced performance, new approaches are required to improve generalization in spatio-physical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

TL;DR: AEGIS is a newly introduced benchmark featuring over 10,000 real and AI-generated videos designed to improve the evaluation of authenticity detection in highly realistic synthetic videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing risks from hyper-realistic AI-generated videos which current video authenticity detection benchmarks fail to evaluate effectively due to limitations in realism, scale, and complexity.

Method: AEGIS compiles real and synthetic videos from state-of-the-art generative models, offers challenging subsets for robustness evaluation, and provides multimodal annotations for detecting authenticity and downstream tasks.

Result: Experiments reveal that advanced vision-language models perform poorly on AEGIS's challenging subsets, underscoring the benchmark's complexity and realism beyond current detection capabilities.

Conclusion: AEGIS serves as an essential benchmark for advancing research on robust, reliable, and generalizable video authenticity detection methods to counter sophisticated forgery threats.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization

### [197] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE is a novel framework addressing slow inference in video diffusion transformers by combining Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention and sparsity-aware step distillation, achieving significant speedups and quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the inefficiency of slow iterative denoising and costly quadratic attention in diffusion transformers for video generation.

Method: BLADE integrates Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention for content-aware sparsity masks and sparsity-aware step distillation using Trajectory Distribution Matching directly within the training process.

Result: BLADE demonstrates up to 14.10x inference acceleration and quality improvements on VBench-2.0 benchmarks, validated on models including Wan2.1-1.3B and CogVideoX-5B.

Conclusion: BLADE effectively combines sparsity mechanisms and distillation into a joint framework, offering both efficiency and quality improvements in video generation models.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

*Zhenning Shi,Zizheng Yan,Yuhang Yu,Clara Xue,Jingyu Zhuang,Qi Zhang,Jinwei Chen,Tao Li,Qingnan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TriFlowSR, a RefSR framework that improves pattern matching between low-resolution and reference images, and Landmark-4K, a UHD RefSR dataset for landmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address poor alignment issues in existing diffusion-based RefSR methods and the lack of high-quality datasets supporting ultra-high-definition image restoration.

Method: The authors propose TriFlowSR, a framework with a Reference Matching Strategy for better pattern alignment, and develop the Landmark-4K dataset for UHD landmark scenarios with real-world degradation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that TriFlowSR leverages semantic and texture details from the reference image more effectively than earlier methods.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR is the first diffusion-based RefSR approach designed for UHD landmark scenarios, offering better restoration quality by effectively addressing alignment and dataset limitations.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a cooperative video-based face liveness detection method using instructed face movement and optical flow analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing passive liveness detection methods struggle to distinguish genuine faces from presentation attacks under varying scenarios.

Method: Participants follow a controlled movement (frontal face approaching the camera), combined with neural optical flow estimation and spatial-temporal feature analysis using a neural classifier.

Result: The method improved the detection of genuine faces versus presentation attacks, including photos, screens, masks, and video replays.

Conclusion: Instructed face movements and optical flow analysis enhance the robustness of face liveness detection systems over passive approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VasoMIM tackles the challenge of vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms with limited annotated data by integrating vascular anatomy into self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data for vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms impedes accurate clinical analysis, motivating the use of SSL methods to leverage unlabeled data.

Method: VasoMIM incorporates an anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss to focus the model on reconstructing vascular regions and enhancing semantic consistency.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on three datasets, validating its effectiveness in improving vascular representation.

Conclusion: VasoMIM provides a promising solution for enhancing X-ray angiogram analysis, leveraging anatomical knowledge to overcome limitations in conventional SSL approaches.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

### [201] [Object Fidelity Diffusion for Remote Sensing Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10801)
*Ziqi Ye,Shuran Ma,Jie Yang,Xiaoyi Yang,Ziyang Gong,Xue Yang,Haipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), a method in diffusion models to boost fidelity and accuracy for remote sensing image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to capture fine morphological details, causing inaccuracies in remote sensing image generation and impacting object detection reliability.

Method: OF-Diff employs prior shapes of objects, a dual-branch diffusion model with consistency loss, and DDPO for fine-tuning to enhance fidelity and diversity without requiring real images during sampling.

Result: OF-Diff outperformed existing methods, improving small object detection (mAP by up to 8.3% for airplanes, 7.7% for ships, and 4.0% for vehicles).

Conclusion: OF-Diff advances remote sensing image generation, increasing the precision of polymorphic and small object classes, thus ensuring reliability of object detection models.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the performance of UI agents on grounding and navigation tasks while using minimal training samples efficiently. It seeks to address the limitations in existing models' reasoning and navigation capabilities.

Method: UI-Venus employs novel reinforcement fine-tuning based on Qwen2.5-VL, reward function designs, data cleaning strategies, and a self-evolving framework to refine reasoning traces and distribute critical actions effectively.

Result: The proposed UI-Venus achieves state-of-the-art benchmarks in UI grounding (94.1%/95.3%) and navigation tasks (49.1%/65.9%), surpassing known baselines like GTA1 and closed-source models.

Conclusion: UI-Venus demonstrates superior performance in both benchmarks and real-world navigation tasks, contributing innovative methods and tools to the field, and opens avenues for future exploration with its open-source deployment.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the
community. Code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/UI-Venus.

### [204] [Self-Supervised Stereo Matching with Multi-Baseline Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10838)
*Peng Xu,Zhiyu Xiang,Jingyun Fu,Tianyu Pu,Kai Wang,Chaojie Ji,Tingming Bai,Eryun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BaCon-Stereo, a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo matching, addressing issues in occluded regions, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the limitations of existing self-supervised stereo matching methods, which struggle in occluded regions due to the breakdown of photometric consistency.

Method: BaCon-Stereo employs a teacher-student paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, where the teacher supervises the student by adapting its predictions to overcome occlusion issues. It also utilizes an occlusion-aware attention map. A new dataset, BaCon-20k, is synthesized for training.

Result: BaCon-Stereo demonstrates improved predictions in occluded and non-occluded regions, strong generalization and robustness, and achieves superior performance on KITTI 2015 and 2012 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed BaCon-Stereo framework effectively addresses the challenges in occluded regions, enhancing stereo matching capabilities and outperforming existing self-supervised methods. Code and dataset will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper presents AdaptFED, an enhancement of the TransFed framework for federated learning (FL). It refines focal modulation with personalized, task-aware embeddings, enhanced theory, and broader validation. A low-rank variant reduces communication overhead for scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the generalization and scalability of transformer-based federated learning frameworks, particularly in non-IID and resource-constrained settings.

Method: AdaptFED refines focal modulation with task-aware client embeddings, proposes new theoretical performance bounds, and validates its method across diverse datasets. Additionally, it introduces a low-rank hypernetwork to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets demonstrate AdaptFED's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in source-free and cross-task federated learning setups.

Conclusion: The proposed AdaptFED advances federated learning by enabling adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: PhysHPO, a novel framework, improves video generation by ensuring physical plausibility using hierarchical preference alignment and automated data selection pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating realistic videos adhering to the laws of physics for applications requiring high realism and accuracy.

Method: The framework uses Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization across four granularities (Instance, State, Motion, and Semantic levels). Additionally, it incorporates automated data selection from large-scale datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments validate that PhysHPO enhances physical realism and overall video generation quality across benchmarks.

Conclusion: PhysHPO marks the first exploration in integrating fine-grained preference alignment and automated data selection for physics-aware video generation, advancing realistic and user-preferred paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance brain tumor classification on MRI through recent advancements in visual question answering using large language models.

Method: Brain tumor cases were transformed into VQA items using curated BraTS datasets. The models were evaluated in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy.

Result: GPT-5-mini achieved the best macro-average accuracy at 44.19%, and no single model performed well across all tumor subtypes.

Conclusion: While GPT-5-family models show moderate accuracy in neuro-oncology tasks, their performance is insufficient for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer combines inbetweening and colorization tasks into a single stage for cartoon production, utilizing sparse inputs for improved efficiency and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The labor-intensive process of cartoon and anime production demands innovative solutions to reduce manual effort and overcome the limitations of existing AI methods that separately address production stages.

Method: ToonComposer integrates inbetweening and colorization through a generative model using sparse sketch injection and a cartoon adaptation layer tailored for video foundation models.

Result: The model requires minimal inputs, such as a single sketch and colored reference frame, while maintaining quality, motion consistency, and production efficiency.

Conclusion: ToonComposer simplifies cartoon production workflows and surpasses existing methods in performance, flexibility, and real-world applicability, as demonstrated by evaluations using the PKBench benchmark.

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more

*Yushi Lan,Yihang Luo,Fangzhou Hong,Shangchen Zhou,Honghua Chen,Zhaoyang Lyu,Shuai Yang,Bo Dai,Chen Change Loy,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R is a novel decoder-only Transformer-based approach for efficient 3D reconstruction using causal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods either rely on expensive global optimization or simplistic memory mechanisms, which struggle with scaling and dynamic scenes.

Method: STream3R utilizes a streaming framework based on decoder-only Transformers with causal attention, learning geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets for better generalization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent outperforming of traditional methods on benchmarks for static and dynamic scenes, indicating superior efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: STream3R highlights the potential of causal Transformer models for real-time online 3D perception, offering compatibility with LLM-style training for large-scale applications.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised learning for Earth observation data and introduces MAESTRO, a Masked Autoencoder adaptation optimized for multimodal and multitemporal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance self-supervised learning techniques tailored for remote sensing data, which possess unique multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral characteristics.

Method: Conduct a benchmark study for fusion strategies and reconstruction target normalization in Earth observation, leading to the development of MAESTRO with spectral priors and optimized normalization schemes.

Result: MAESTRO achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks requiring multitemporal dynamics and performs effectively in mono-temporal modality-oriented tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts self-supervised learning methods to Earth observation challenges and provides a robust framework for various observation tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

### [213] [ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896)
*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes ESSENTIAL, a method for video class-incremental learning (VCIL) that integrates episodic and semantic memory to address the trade-off between memory-efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VCIL methods face a trade-off between mitigation of catastrophic forgetting and memory efficiency. Existing approaches either use dense memory storage with high inefficiency or sparse sampling, which compromises temporal information and performance.

Method: The proposed ESSENTIAL integrates episodic memory (temporally sparse features) and semantic memory (general knowledge with learnable prompts) using a memory retrieval module based on cross-attention. This module retrieves dense features from sparse ones.

Result: ESSENTIAL was validated rigorously on diverse datasets like UCF-101, HMDB51, ActivityNet, and others. It achieved favorable performance while using significantly less memory compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL effectively addresses the trade-off in VCIL by combining episodic and semantic memory, leading to improved performance with lower memory usage across various benchmarks.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

*Mengyuan Liu,Xinshun Wang,Zhongbin Fang,Deheng Ye,Xia Li,Tao Tang,Songtao Wu,Xiangtai Li,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HiC, a unified cross-domain model for 3D human motion to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets, surpassing previous methods in generalization, scalability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain models rely on domain-specific elements and multi-stage training, limiting their scalability and practicality in modeling 3D human motion.

Method: They first introduced Pose-in-Context (PiC) and later expanded it to Human-in-Context (HiC) with a max-min similarity sampling strategy, dual-branch architecture, and integration of pose and mesh representations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated that HiC achieves better generalization, scalability, and cross-domain performance than PiC.

Conclusion: HiC shows strong potential as a comprehensive cross-domain model for 3D human motion modeling, addressing tasks, diverse modalities, and datasets in a unified manner.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

*Chaoyue Song,Xiu Li,Fan Yang,Zhongcong Xu,Jiacheng Wei,Fayao Liu,Jiashi Feng,Guosheng Lin,Jianfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Puppeteer, a framework for automatic rigging and animation of 3D objects using advanced AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transforming static 3D models into animated assets is a bottleneck in content creation, requiring expert intervention despite advances in generative AI for static models.

Method: Puppeteer uses an auto-regressive transformer for skeletal structure prediction, an attention-based architecture for skinning weights with topology-aware joint attention, and a differentiable optimization-based pipeline for efficient animation generation.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skeletal prediction accuracy and skinning quality, demonstrating robustness across diverse 3D content and eliminating common animation issues like jittering.

Conclusion: Puppeteer effectively automates rigging and animation, enabling stable and high-fidelity animations for diverse 3D objects with enhanced efficiency.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

*Shuteng Wang,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quantum Visual Field (QVF), a novel approach in Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) for effective learning and representation of 2D images and 3D geometric fields, showcasing superior performance compared to classical and quantum baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in architecture design, training efficiency, and utilization of quantum-mechanical properties within Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) for visual field learning.

Method: The paper proposes QVF, which uses neural amplitude encoding within a quantum state space and fully entangled parametric quantum circuits, ensuring stability and convergence. It avoids classical post-processing, extracting signals solely through projective measurements.

Result: Simulation-based experiments show that QVF achieves better visual representation accuracy than previous quantum methods and classical baselines, excelling in high-frequency detail learning and practical tasks like 2D/3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation.

Conclusion: QVF presents a promising direction in quantum-assisted visual field learning by addressing limitations in training and representation while demonstrating practical use cases in complex visual data tasks.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

*Laura Lawniczak,Tobias Distler*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShellFT, a framework for selective hybrid fault-tolerant replication to enhance consensus systems, achieving over 70% reduction in diversification costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inflexibility and high diversification overhead of existing hybrid fault-tolerant systems in consensus replication.

Method: Proposed ShellFT framework, leveraging micro replication for selective Byzantine fault tolerance. Presented and analyzed three custom ShellFT protocols.

Result: ShellFT demonstrated significant reduction in diversification costs, minimizing them by over 70% compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ShellFT offers a flexible hybrid fault-tolerant approach, enabling tailored solutions with lower cost and improved adaptability to specific use case requirements.

Abstract: Hybrid fault models are known to be an effective means for enhancing the
robustness of consensus-based replicated systems. However, existing
hybridization approaches suffer from limited flexibility with regard to the
composition of crash-tolerant and Byzantine fault-tolerant system parts and/or
are associated with a significant diversification overhead. In this paper we
address these issues with ShellFT, a framework that leverages the concept of
micro replication to allow system designers to freely choose the parts of the
replication logic that need to be resilient against Byzantine faults. As a key
benefit, such a selective hybridization makes it possible to develop hybrid
solutions that are tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of
individual use cases. To illustrate this flexibility, we present three custom
ShellFT protocols and analyze the complexity of their implementations. Our
evaluation shows that compared with traditional hybridization approaches,
ShellFT is able to decrease diversification costs by more than 70%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scientific HPC workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability due to the diversity in HPC hardware and the efficiency of GPUs at lower precision.

Method: The authors used the Hipify framework for performance portability, optimized AMD GPU performance through the rocBLAS library, and developed a dynamic mixed-precision framework to minimize errors based on a Pareto front analysis.

Result: FFTMatvec was successfully adapted to AMD GPUs, demonstrating strong performance and scalability on the OLCF Frontier supercomputer across 2,048 GPUs.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates a practical solution for leveraging mixed precision and performance portability in HPC applications, ensuring compatibility with diverse hardware like AMD GPUs while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities,
alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when
computing in lower precision, provide a strong incentive for scientific HPC
workflows to adopt mixed-precision algorithms and performance portability
models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance
portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes
matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach
enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD
GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD
GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the
application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework
for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision
configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct
MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable,
mixed-precision FFTMatvec is scaled to 2,048 GPUs on the OLCF Frontier
supercomputer.

TL;DR: OpenFPL is an open-source Fantasy Premier League (FPL) forecasting method using public data, achieving accuracy comparable to commercial services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize access to highly accurate FPL forecasts by using publicly available data.

Method: OpenFPL employs position-specific ensemble models optimized on FPL and Understat data from four seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24).

Result: OpenFPL shows comparable accuracy to leading commercial services and performs better for high-return players, across various forecast horizons.

Conclusion: OpenFPL proves to be a reliable tool for long-term FPL planning and strategy optimization, accessible to all participants.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces xRFM, an algorithm combining feature learning kernel machines and tree structures, outperforming existing methods like GBDTs in tabular data inference across regression and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has progressed rapidly, predictive methods for tabular data remain reliant on traditional techniques like GBDTs. The paper seeks to leverage advancements in neural networks and feature learning to improve tabular data analytics.

Method: The authors developed xRFM by integrating feature learning kernel machines with a tree-based structure, optimizing for local data structure adaptability and scalability.

Result: xRFM shows superior performance over 31 competing methods across 100 regression and competitive results across 200 classification datasets. It also outperforms GBDTs and offers native interpretability.

Conclusion: xRFM represents a significant advancement for tabular data inference, providing improved prediction accuracy, scalability, and interpretability.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Result: At 1 and 2 months, the RL group showed significant increases in daily step count compared to control (+296 steps at 1 month, +210 steps at 2 months) and other groups (random and fixed arms).

Conclusion: The results highlight the potential of RL algorithms to improve physical activity through personalized, behaviorally-informed mobile health nudges, offering a scalable solution to promote healthier lifestyles.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [227] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability in time series forecasting models, emphasizing the need to prioritize stability in production systems to reduce human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecast accuracy is often the primary focus in time series forecasting, but in real-world production, demand planners value consistent and stable forecasts over small gains in accuracy to avoid high human intervention and loss of trust.

Method: The authors conduct a case study using advanced forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST, Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and AutoGluon) to evaluate their stability and accuracy on public datasets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales.

Result: The study finds that ensemble models are more stable and can maintain or even improve forecast accuracy. This points to their utility in reducing model-induced stochasticity.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for further investigation into the stability of forecasting models, especially for production deployments, to align with the practical needs of demand planners.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [228] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the first constrained decoding method for diffusion language models to ensure adherence to formal languages like C++ and JSON, achieving near-perfect syntactic correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to adhere to formal language syntactic constraints due to their probabilistic nature. This limits their application in tasks needing strict language-specific compliance.

Method: The method reduces constrained decoding to the additive infilling problem and develops an algorithm to decide the intersection of formal context-free and regular languages efficiently.

Result: The proposed method ensures near-perfect syntactic correctness and maintains or enhances functional correctness in applications like C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction.

Conclusion: This approach makes constrained decoding feasible for diffusion models with negligible computational overhead, ensuring practical usability in enforcing formal language adherence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

### [229] [Less is More: Learning Graph Tasks with Just LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10115)
*Sola Shirai,Kavitha Srinivas,Julian Dolby,Michael Katz,Horst Samulowitz,Shirin Sohrabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores whether LLMs can learn and generalize graph-related tasks without relying on specialized graph encoding models or GNNs, showing promising results using chain-of-thought solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods (e.g., graph serialization and GNN-LLM combinations) in enabling LLMs to reason over graphs and assess alternative approaches.

Method: The authors train LLMs, even smaller ones, using instructive chain-of-thought solutions to teach them to solve graph tasks, testing their generalization capabilities without requiring specialized graph encoders.

Result: Small LLMs successfully learn to solve graph tasks and generalize these solutions to unseen graph structures and tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs do not need specialized graph encoders to perform well on graph-related reasoning tasks; chain-of-thought training is effective for generalization to new graph challenges.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

*Ke Niu,Haiyang Yu,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Teng Fu,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAD-RL, a framework using reinforcement learning and multimodal Chain-of-Thought for automated parametric 3D modeling, significantly improving reasoning, precision, and code executability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in CAD workflows, which require extensive expertise and manual effort, by leveraging advancements in large language models to automate parametric 3D modeling.

Method: The authors propose CAD-RL, which includes a Cold Start phase using Chain-of-Thought reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning with three custom rewards (executability, geometric accuracy, and external evaluation). They introduce optimization strategies like Trust Region Stretch, Precision Token Loss, and Overlong Filtering to stabilize the learning process.

Result: CAD-RL is shown to outperform existing vision-language models in reasoning quality, output precision, and the ability to execute CAD code. A novel dataset, ExeCAD, is introduced to support this system.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that CAD-RL enhances automated CAD code generation, overcoming challenges like precision and logical reasoning while laying the foundation for further advancements in CAD automation.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

*Maxime Heuillet,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Audrey Durand,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method, Nested-ReFT, to improve computational efficiency in training large language models for reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reasoning tasks using reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) have high computational demands due to multiple inference steps during training.

Method: Nested-ReFT introduces off-policy reinforcement learning with a subset of the model's layers acting as a behavior model, reducing computational costs by integrating speculative decoding and dynamic layer skipping during training.

Result: The approach improves computational efficiency (measured in tokens/sec) across various math reasoning benchmarks and model sizes while delivering performance on par with standard methods.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT provides an efficient alternative to existing ReFT frameworks by reducing inference costs without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

### [232] [Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228)
*Abdelmoula El Yazizi,Samee U. Khan,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study analyzes D-Wave quantum annealer's sampling quality compared to Gibbs sampling in Restricted Boltzmann Machines, finding limited improvements to sampling quality at different stages of training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum annealing-based sampling, such as from D-Wave machines, holds the promise to improve the training of RBMs. This study seeks to understand whether D-Wave sampling outperforms classical methods like Gibbs sampling in terms of capturing diverse local valleys.

Method: The authors compare samples from RBMs obtained using classical Gibbs sampling and D-Wave quantum annealing, evaluating metrics like the number of local valleys and the energy of corresponding local minima.

Result: The study found that sampling by D-Wave captures a somewhat higher number of local valleys than Gibbs sampling but with less complementarity in high-probability states. Interaction between the two methods changed as training progresses, with limited benefits during final epochs.

Conclusion: While D-Wave sampling showed potential differences from Gibbs sampling, substantial improvements were not achieved under annealing conditions. There is potential for improvement using hybrid classical-quantum approaches in RBM training.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy focused on aligning deep neural network representations with Neural Collapse geometry, improving their performance in multivariate time series classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the effectiveness of semi-supervised learning in capturing complex temporal patterns for time series classification by optimizing pretext tasks and embedding geometry.

Method: Combines pseudo-labeling and rotational equiangular tight frame-classifiers for pre-training. Integrates generative pretext tasks and proposes sequential augmentation strategies to enhance temporal dynamics and embedding separability.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing pretext approaches across three multivariate time series classification datasets using LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometries ensures stronger transferability and improved classification performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a task-agnostic framework for brain-computer interfaces that addresses the issue of accuracy degradation by enabling continual model adaptation without calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs suffer from accuracy degradation due to neural signal drift over time and variations among users, necessitating frequent recalibration and limiting their practical application.

Method: EDAPT involves training a baseline model on data from multiple users and continually personalizing it via supervised finetuning during use. It also employs unsupervised domain adaptation on some datasets.

Result: Across nine datasets and three BCI tasks, EDAPT consistently enhanced accuracy compared to static methods. Performance gains were driven by population-level pretraining and continual finetuning.

Conclusion: EDAPT offers an efficient, calibration-free approach to improving BCIs, addressing a significant barrier to real-world deployment by enabling scalable and accurate model updates.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

*Maria Stoica,Francesco Leofante,Alessio Lomuscio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection using counterfactual explanations to improve accuracy, scalability, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the safety of machine learning systems by improving the detection of OOD data, leveraging decision boundary distances for reliable performance.

Method: The method uses post-hoc OOD detection by calculating distances to decision boundaries via counterfactual explanations. To handle large architectures, the authors improve scalability by calculating counterfactuals in the embedding space.

Result: The proposed method performs comparably or better than the state-of-the-art, achieving strong results on several benchmarks: 93.50% AUROC on CIFAR-10, 97.05% AUROC on CIFAR-100, and 92.55% AUROC on ImageNet-200.

Conclusion: This method improves OOD detection accuracy and interpretability, with potential practical advantages in scalability and reliability for modern machine learning systems.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

*Ricardo Diaz-Rincon,Muxuan Liang,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Benjamin Shickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a conformal prediction framework to anticipate Parkinson's Disease medication needs up to two years in advance with precise prediction intervals and quantified uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medication management for Parkinson's Disease relies on trial-and-error methods, lacking systematic predictive approaches and quantified uncertainty for decision-making.

Method: The study leverages a two-stage conformal prediction framework using electronic health records to predict levodopa dosing adjustments and account for zero-inflation in inpatient data.

Result: The framework achieved reliable statistical guarantees, provided optimal prediction intervals for short-term and long-term planning, and improved prediction precision compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Quantifying prediction uncertainty in Parkinson's medication management enables evidence-based dosing adjustments, balancing symptom control and minimizing side effects, thereby improving patient quality of life.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the behavior of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) models, focusing on convergence rates at population and finite-sample levels under different initial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of model misspecification in mixture models, specifically when the number of mixture components assumed in the model exceeds those in the data distribution.

Method: Theoretical analysis is performed on the EM algorithm's convergence, examining both population-level and finite-sample level scenarios. Convergence rates are analyzed for unbalanced and balanced initial conditions for mixing weights.

Result: The paper establishes linear and sublinear convergence rates at the population level, along with statistical accuracy bounds at the finite-sample level. Connections between the two levels are explored, leading to derived iteration complexity bounds.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the EM algorithm's performance under model misspecification in 2MLR, offering valuable theoretical bounds for convergence and accuracy, even in challenging setups like low SNR regimes.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how impactful benchmarks influence reasoning language models' performance and generalization capabilities during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the scaling dimension of reasoning in large language models and improve their generalization capabilities.

Method: The authors evaluated reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 using benchmarks derived from sequential decision-making tasks, treating benchmarks as learning curricula rather than test sets.

Result: Better performance and generalization were observed not only due to model size but by leveraging impactful benchmarks during training.

Conclusion: Steering AI development through benchmark-driven curricula can enhance reasoning models and redefine benchmarks as tools for learning instead of mere evaluation instruments.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

### [239] [Unpacking the Implicit Norm Dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization in Tensorized Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10435)
*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in tensorized models, introduces 'Norm Deviation' to analyze SAM's dynamics, and proposes Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS) for improved performance with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of understanding of SAM's behavior in general tensorized or scale-invariant models beyond simple settings.

Method: The study uses gradient flow analysis to examine SAM's impact on 'Norm Deviation' and proposes the DAS method for data-adaptive scaling of core norms.

Result: DAS demonstrates competitive or superior performance to SAM across various tasks such as tensor completion and fine-tuning, with reduced computational demands.

Conclusion: Deviation-Aware Scaling efficiently mimics SAM's regularization effects and is a valuable alternative with less computational cost.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our

TL;DR: This study uses ML methods with IoT devices for monitoring cattle activity and showcases explainable AI models, achieving high accuracy in activity classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of monitoring cattle health and improving yield through data-driven solutions using explainable ML to support dairy farmers.

Method: The study employs 3-axis accelerometer data, Bluetooth IoT devices, signal processing, statistical feature extraction, sliding window techniques, and hyperparameter-tuned ML models for activity classification.

Result: The k-nearest neighbour classifier achieved the best results with a 0.99 AUC on the testing set. SHAP was used for feature interpretation and transparency.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of explainable, robust ML models in aiding sustainable and informed cattle farming practices.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

*Will Fein,Ryan J. Horwitz,John E. Brown III,Amit Misra,Felipe Oviedo,Kevin White,Juan M. Lavista Ferres,Samuel K. Wasser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces an AI-driven pipeline to analyze handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks as forensic evidence, offering a cheaper and scalable alternative to DNA analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop alternative methods for analyzing seized ivory and disrupting trafficking networks, as traditional methods like DNA analysis are expensive and sometimes unavailable.

Method: Collected 6,085 photographs of seized tusks over six years and used an AI object detection model to extract and analyze over 17,000 markings, identifying recurring signatures that link traffickers.

Result: Identified 184 recurring 'signature markings,' with 20 appearing in multiple seizures, creating forensic links between trafficking incidents.

Conclusion: AI-driven handwriting analysis on tusks enhances wildlife forensics, complements traditional techniques, and offers practical steps to combat organized wildlife crime.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

*Alexander Merkov,David Rohde,Alexandre Gilotte,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how common practices in recommender systems, like feature engineering and A/B testing, can unintentionally introduce confounding, which affects performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unobserved confounding leads to biased causal effect estimates in various fields, and its unnoticed presence in recommender systems undermines their effectiveness.

Method: The paper provides simulations and illustrations demonstrating how standard practices in recommendation systems can cause confounding, alongside practical suggestions for mitigation.

Result: It is shown that practices such as feature engineering, modularization, and A/B testing can introduce confounding effects in recommender systems, impacting their accuracy.

Conclusion: Practitioners in recommender systems should take careful measures to identify and mitigate confounding to maintain system performance.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

*Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Junyi Fan,Yong Si,Minoo Ahmadi,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study presents a LightGBM-based machine learning model for accurately predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving AUROC 0.808 and high negative predictive value (NPV 0.911).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cirrhosis-related AKI significantly worsens patient outcomes, yet current predictive tools lack the necessary precision and compatibility with ICU workflows, necessitating a more accurate and interpretable model.

Method: The study retrospectively analyzed the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database, selected 1240 ICU patients with cirrhosis, and applied preprocessing, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE balancing. Six machine learning models were trained and evaluated using metrics like AUROC, accuracy, and F1-score.

Result: LightGBM showed the best performance with AUROC 0.808, accuracy 0.704, and NPV 0.911. Key predictors such as prolonged thromboplastin time and altered pH aligned with known AKI mechanisms.

Conclusion: The interpretable LightGBM model effectively predicts early AKI risk in cirrhosis ICU patients, allowing for safe de-escalation of low-risk cases and actionable insights. External validation and electronic health record integration are recommended.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

### [244] [Can Transformers Break Encryption Schemes via In-Context Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10235)
*Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza,Aditya Tomar,Abein Abraham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of in-context learning (ICL) in transformer language models for cryptographic function learning, focusing on inferring hidden mappings in mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to examine transformer-based language models' ability to use ICL for structured inference tasks in cryptographic settings, where deciphering hidden mappings poses unique challenges.

Method: The authors use transformers to learn private-key encryption schemes (mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers) by conditioning on (cipher text, plain text) pairs without parameter updates, testing their inductive bias.

Result: Transformers demonstrate the capability to decode unseen cipher text words by inferring underlying substitutions using ICL, highlighting their generalization ability for cryptographic functions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that transformer-based ICL provides a promising approach for solving cryptographic inference tasks, illustrating their structured reasoning and generalization potential.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDNS, a novel framework for generating samples from discrete, high-dimensional, and multi-modal distributions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on improving sampling from complex discrete state spaces, which is critical for areas like statistical physics, machine learning, and optimization.

Method: The proposed solution, MDNS, aligns path measures using learning objectives derived from stochastic optimal control of continuous-time Markov chains.

Result: MDNS demonstrates superior performance in sampling from diverse and high-dimensional distributions, outperforming existing learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: MDNS proves effective and scalable for discrete-state space sampling, showcasing potential in various applications through its capability to handle high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

### [246] [Pruning and Malicious Injection: A Retraining-Free Backdoor Attack on Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10243)
*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HPMI, a retraining-free backdoor attack on transformer models that functions by pruning noncritical heads and injecting malicious ones, achieving high success rates with minimal impact on original performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current backdoor attack methods that require retraining or altering model architecture, which are often resource-demanding and intrusive.

Method: Head-wise Pruning and Malicious Injection (HPMI) prunes the least important head from a transformer model and injects a pre-trained malicious head, eliminating retraining needs and preserving the model's original architecture.

Result: HPMI demonstrates negligible loss in clean accuracy, over 99.55% attack success rate, and successfully bypasses four advanced defense mechanisms in experiments across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: HPMI offers a stealthy, effective, and resource-efficient backdoor attack method for transformer models, outperforming retraining-dependent attacks in both concealment and robustness.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

*Shouju Wang,Yuchen Song,Sheng'en Li,Dongmian Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DECAF-GAD, a fairness-aware framework for graph anomaly detection that balances performance and fairness using a structural causal model and a fairness-guided loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness in graph anomaly detection tasks, where existing bias in the training data can lead to unfair model outcomes.

Method: Introduced the DECAF-GAD framework that employs a structural causal model to disentangle sensitive attributes and employs a fairness-guided loss function within an autoencoder architecture.

Result: DECAF-GAD achieves competitive anomaly detection accuracy while improving fairness metrics significantly over baseline methods, according to experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD is a viable solution for fair graph anomaly detection, addressing biases without compromising on detection performance.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and theoretical understanding of function approximation by leveraging exponential neural network operators.

Method: The authors propose and extend Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators. They analyze their pointwise/uniform convergence, convergence rates using logarithmic modulus of continuity, and study these operators within the Orlicz space.

Result: The paper establishes convergence behaviors, estimates rates of convergence, and visually demonstrates approximation errors with specific kernels and activation functions.

Conclusion: The Max Min Kantorovich-type operators show promise for effective function approximation, providing insights into their behavior and practical utility for achieving accurate results.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating
functions using exponential neural network operators. We extend this framework
to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational limitations and scalability issues of Gaussian Processes (GPs) in streaming scenarios, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

Method: The paper provides a comparative analysis of reduction criteria for removing redundant datapoints and introduces acceptance criteria to refine the dataset in online GP algorithms.

Result: The evaluation of reduction criteria is conducted using benchmark functions and real-world datasets, delivering insights into computational efficiency and reduction behavior.

Conclusion: Practical guidelines are presented for selecting suitable reduction and acceptance criteria to optimize online GP algorithms for dynamic system identification and other applications.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and complex scheduling in cloud-native database systems, which require efficient and adaptive resource management.

Method: The paper proposes a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism and a reward-shaping strategy. These approaches integrate local performance signals with global system feedback, implemented in a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework.

Result: The proposed method outperformed traditional scheduling approaches in metrics such as resource utilization, scheduling latency, system stability, and fairness. It demonstrated strong adaptability in highly concurrent and complex systems.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and practical for real-world, large-scale scheduling challenges, proving its robustness and generalization capabilities in cloud systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments such as data privacy leakage, resource heterogeneity, and centralized modeling limitations.

Method: The method involves federated training where tenants train models locally and share parameters to create a global model. A personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced to accommodate tenant-specific resource usage patterns.

Result: Using real cloud telemetry data, the method showed superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to existing models, demonstrated through metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Conclusion: The proposed method proves effective in anomaly detection, offering stability and high accuracy, showcasing its value for intelligent resource monitoring in cloud computing.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

### [252] [Source Component Shift Adaptation via Offline Decomposition and Online Mixing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10257)
*Ryuta Matsuno*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to adapt to source component shifts in data streams combining offline model decomposition with online mixing, showing significantly improved prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing approaches in adapting to source component shifts, including poor handling of recurring shifts in online methods and insufficient representation of components in model-pool-based approaches.

Method: The method involves decomposing source components offline using the EM algorithm to prepare individual prediction models, and adapting their weights online using convex optimization for better predictions.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements, reducing cumulative test loss by up to 67.4% on diverse real-world regression datasets compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages the properties of source component shifts, providing superior adaptation through a combination of offline decomposition and online adjustment, proving its efficacy through substantial empirical success.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynBrain, a probabilistic framework for modeling how visual stimuli generate cortical responses, excelling in capturing biological variability and functional consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deterministic methods fail to capture the variability in hemodynamic responses to identical visual stimuli while maintaining consistency in stimulus encoding across trials, contexts, and subjects.

Method: The SynBrain framework includes two components: (i) BrainVAE, which uses probabilistic learning for modeling neural representations with visual semantic constraints, and (ii) a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper that projects visual semantics into a neural response manifold for accurate fMRI synthesis.

Result: SynBrain outperformed state-of-the-art methods in subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding, adapted well to new subjects with limited data, and synthesized high-quality fMRI signals that improved data-limited fMRI-to-image decoding.

Conclusion: SynBrain effectively models visual-to-neural transformations probabilistically, highlights functional consistency, adapts with few-shot learning, and enhances the understanding of biological neural variability.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the need for healthcare institutions to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases while maintaining privacy and leveraging the capabilities of foundation models in federated learning.

Method: The method involves Federated Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization (FedKEI), which includes global clustering, optimization of aggregation weights within and across clusters, and a bi-level optimization scheme for effective knowledge transfer and task adaptation.

Result: The proposed method, FedKEI, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to new tasks across three different datasets: dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT.

Conclusion: FedKEI demonstrates an effective way to enhance federated learning by personalizing knowledge transfer, making it highly suitable for rapidly evolving healthcare environments.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [255] [A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315)
*Keke Gai,Dongjue Wang,Jing Yu,Liehuang Zhu,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIP-Fed, a defense framework for backdoor attacks in Federated Learning under heterogeneous data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming backdoor attacks in Federated Learning, especially under heterogeneous client data distributions, without relying on clean server datasets.

Method: Integrates pre- and post-aggregation defense strategies leveraging vision-language models like CLIP. Utilizes prototype contrastive loss and KL divergence for alignment.

Result: CLIP-Fed improved attack success rate reduction (ASR) by up to 2.03% while boosting model accuracy (MA) by up to 7.92% in experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively mitigates backdoor attacks and boosts model performance, addressing major limitations in prior methods for Federated Learning.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

### [256] [Welfare-Centric Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10345)
*Claire Jie Zhang,Seyed A. Esmaeili,Jamie Morgenstern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes welfare-centric clustering based on group utilities, addressing limitations of prior fairness notions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rectify undesirable outcomes in fair clustering by focusing on group utilities and welfare rather than traditional fairness metrics.

Method: Two optimization objectives—Rawlsian and Utilitarian—are formalized, with novel algorithms and their theoretical guarantees.

Result: Experiments validate superior performance over existing fair clustering baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Welfare-centric clustering improves fairness outcomes using group utility-based approaches.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

### [257] [A Hierarchical IDS for Zero-Day Attack Detection in Internet of Medical Things Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10346)
*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-level Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) that effectively detects cyberattacks, including zero-day threats, ensuring high accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized IDS systems are impractical for IoMT due to privacy risks, response delays, and device constraints, necessitating a new framework for securing medical networks.

Method: The proposed IDS framework uses a multi-layer structure: the first layer (near Edge) employs meta-learning or One Class Classification to filter traffic, while subsequent layers (far Edge and Cloud) identify attack types and novelties. It is evaluated on the CICIoMT2024 dataset.

Result: Experiments show the IDS achieves 99.77% accuracy and a 97.8% F1-score in identifying attacks, with the first layer successfully detecting zero-day threats without requiring updated datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates high effectiveness, scalability, and applicability for protecting IoMT environments against both known and unknown cyber threats.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

*Samer Lahoud,Kinda Khawam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores semantic communication with emphasis on distribution learning, highlighting key conditions for learnability, trade-offs between immediate performance and long-term adaptation, and validation through experiments on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift semantic communication from optimizing individual transmissions to learning source statistics when priors are unknown, aiming for better adaptation capabilities.

Method: Developing theoretical conditions for learnability, proving matrix rank requirements, analyzing convergence rates, quantifying semantic distortion, and validating through CIFAR-10 experiments.

Result: The experiments demonstrated how system conditioning affects learning rates and performance, revealing trade-offs between immediate semantic performance and long-term learnability.

Conclusion: The study establishes theoretical foundations and design principles for semantic communication, balancing short-term optimization with long-term adaptability for improved system design.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces eMamba, a hardware acceleration framework for deploying Mamba SSM models on edge platforms, optimizing resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of hardware acceleration frameworks optimized for deploying Mamba models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The framework replaces computationally intensive model components with hardware-efficient alternatives, uses approximation-aware NAS to fine-tune parameters, and implements the design on FPGA and ASIC platforms.

Result: eMamba demonstrates competitive accuracy with fewer parameters, stable performance on natural language tasks, and superior hardware efficiency compared to baseline solutions.

Conclusion: eMamba enables efficient deployment of Mamba SSM models in edge devices, achieving significant improvements in latency, throughput, power consumption, and energy efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### [260] [A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393)
*Liyun Zhang,Jingcheng Ke,Shenli Fan,Xuanmeng Sha,Zheng Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an evaluation framework with new metrics to assess if models in Individual Tendency Learning (ITL) truly capture annotators' unique tendencies and explain their behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of frameworks to evaluate whether ITL methods adequately capture annotator-specific tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Method: The authors propose a unified evaluation framework with two metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) for capturing tendency consistency, and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE) for assessing behavioral explainability via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).

Result: Experiments show that the proposed evaluation framework effectively measures the ability of ITL models to explain annotator behavior and tendencies.

Conclusion: The framework and its metrics fill a critical gap by providing a methodology to evaluate ITL systems' understanding and explanation of annotator behavior effectively.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

### [261] [XQuant: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache Rematerialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10395)
*Aditya Tomar,Coleman Hooper,Minjae Lee,Haocheng Xi,Rishabh Tiwari,Wonjun Kang,Luca Manolache,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces XQuant, a method to drastically cut memory usage in LLM inference using low-bit quantization, with negligible accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLM inference faces challenges due to high memory usage and bandwidth needs, while compute capabilities have outpaced memory performance over the years.

Method: The proposed XQuant quantizes layer input activations (X) instead of using standard key-value (KV) caching, enabling rematerialization of Keys and Values during inference, and also exploits inter-layer similarity in embeddings via XQuant-CL.

Result: XQuant achieves up to 7.7× memory savings with less than 0.1 perplexity loss, and XQuant-CL attains up to 12.5× memory compression with minimal accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: XQuant balances modern hardware compute capabilities to alleviate memory bottlenecks, outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache quantization with near-native accuracy.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

*Pengbo Shen,Yaqing Wang,Ni Mu,Yao Luan,Runpeng Xie,Senhao Yang,Lexiang Wang,Hao Hu,Shuang Xu,Yiqin Yang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of existing benchmarks for evaluating AI in complex decision-making tasks by introducing SC2Arena as a comprehensive StarCraft II benchmark and StarEvolve as a hierarchical framework for better gameplay modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like StarCraft II fail to capture the complexity of the game, including diverse action spaces and playable races, making it difficult to judge AI effectiveness in real-time strategic planning.

Method: Introduces SC2Arena benchmark for comprehensive StarCraft II evaluation with all playable races and optimized text-based observations, along with StarEvolve framework that uses a hierarchical Planner-Executor-Verifier structure and scoring system.

Result: Experimental results show StarEvolve achieves superior performance in strategic planning compared to prior methods, alongside generating insights using SC2Arena that were previously unattainable.

Conclusion: The paper provides tools and frameworks that improve the evaluation and performance of AI agents in complex decision-making tasks, which are publicly accessible for further research and development.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

### [263] [RealAC: A Domain-Agnostic Framework for Realistic and Actionable Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10455)
*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RealAC, a framework for generating realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations for AI decisions. It preserves data distribution dependencies and accommodates user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing counterfactual explanation methods, including rigid domain-specific constraints and lack of user-centered customization.

Method: The method involves a domain-agnostic framework aligning feature joint distributions to ensure realism and allows users to freeze selected attributes during optimization.

Result: RealAC outperforms existing approaches in maintaining causal plausibility, dependency preservation, and realism across synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: RealAC offers a comprehensive solution for generating causally-aware and user-specific counterfactuals, improving both practical usability and performance over prior methods.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

### [264] [X-Node: Self-Explanation is All We Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10461)
*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Node is a self-explaining GNN framework that generates node-level explanations integrated into the prediction process, maintaining competitive classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs excel in classification tasks but lack transparency in decision-making, which is critical for clinical applications where interpretability is essential.

Method: X-Node enables each node to generate a structured context vector with interpretable features, processed by a Reasoner module. This module creates an explanation vector that aids embedding reconstruction, natural language explanation generation, and enhances GNN performance via text-injection.

Result: Evaluations on MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST datasets, with various GNN backbones like GCN, GAT, and GIN, show that X-Node achieves competitive classification accuracy while providing faithful, per-node explanations.

Conclusion: X-Node addresses the lack of interpretability in GNNs by integrating explainability directly into the model, making it suitable for applications requiring both high accuracy and transparency, such as clinical tasks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG is a federated graph learning framework addressing class imbalance by using hierarchical generative adversarial networks to synthesize minority-class features, improving performance on heterogeneous graph data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in federated graph learning leads to biased models that fail in identifying rare but critical events.

Method: GraphFedMIG employs generative adversarial networks at a hierarchical level, with client-specific generators and clustered discriminators driven by a mutual information-guided mechanism.

Result: GraphFedMIG demonstrated superior performance over baseline methods in extensive experiments on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG effectively tackles statistical heterogeneity and class imbalance in federated graph learning.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to leverage JEPAs and overcome limitations of reconstruction-based methods to build effective world models for better control and estimation in robotics.

Method: The technique integrates sequence embeddings with neural ODEs, using loss functions that impose contractive embeddings and Lipschitz constants in state transitions, creating structured latent state spaces.

Result: The method successfully generated latent state-space models for a pendulum system using only image data, showcasing its capability.

Conclusion: This innovative approach using continuous-time dynamic systems and embeddings opens new opportunities for general control algorithms and estimation techniques applicable in robotics.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

*Amir Mehrpanah,Matteo Gamba,Kevin Smith,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unifying spectral framework to analyze and quantify the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness in explanations of ReLU networks, addressing noisy gradient-based interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU networks often produce noisy and pixel-specific gradient-based explanations due to sharp transitions, making it hard to interpret decisions. Existing smoothing methods compromise faithfulness.

Method: The authors develop a spectral framework that quantifies the smoothness and faithfulness of explanations. They also measure the distortion introduced by surrogate models using the concept of an "explanation gap."

Result: Their framework identifies and regularizes the ReLU networks' high-frequency contributions that influence explanations. They demonstrate how these factors work across various post-hoc methods, datasets, and design choices.

Conclusion: The framework aids in systematically balancing smoothness and faithfulness in explanations, offering a principled method to evaluate and reduce distortions in interpretation techniques.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design

### [269] [Contrastive ECOC: Learning Output Codes for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10491)
*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces automated codebook learning models for multiclass classification using contrastive learning, showing enhanced robustness over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ECOC methods require labor-intensive manual or random codebook generation, which might not be optimal for specific datasets.

Method: The authors propose three models based on contrastive learning to automatically and adaptively learn codebooks from the data.

Result: Across four datasets, the proposed models are shown to be more robust to adversarial attacks than two baseline methods.

Conclusion: Automated, adaptive codebook learning can outperform traditional ECOC techniques, providing efficacy and resilience advantages.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

### [270] [A Unified Multi-Agent Framework for Universal Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10494)
*Jiulin Li,Ping Huang,Yexin Li,Shuo Chen,Juewen Hu,Ye Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGUS, a modular system for multimodal understanding and generation, which separates reasoning (Cognition) and generation (Deliberation) processes, achieving flexibility, scalability, and state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for flexible and scalable multimodal systems that can leverage the reasoning capabilities of language models and the generative strengths of diffusion models, addressing limitations of current pipeline-based or tightly integrated approaches.

Method: The authors propose MAGUS, which operates with two decoupled phases: Cognition, using multimodal agents for structured reasoning and planning, and Deliberation, combining reasoning and generation with a Growth-Aware Search mechanism. This design enables modular, extensible, and efficient multimodal tasks without joint training.

Result: Experiments show that MAGUS outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art systems in various tasks, such as image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction following. It notably outperforms GPT-4o on the MME benchmark.

Conclusion: MAGUS demonstrates the potential of modular frameworks in multimodal systems, proving its effectiveness in combining reasoning and generation while maintaining extensibility and scalability.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

### [271] [Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10520)
*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning approach to train Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo algorithms for combinatorial optimization, achieving better residual energy, time-to-solution, and solution diversity compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The hardest combinatorial optimization problems, especially those near computational phase transitions, are challenging for conventional MCMC algorithms due to limitations like being stuck in suboptimal states and difficulty in exploring solution space.

Method: The paper employs deep reinforcement learning to optimize nonlocal transition policies of Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo algorithms, using energy changes and landscape geometry as inputs for training the RL model.

Result: The RL-trained solver outperforms conventional MCMC and nonlocal simulated annealing methods on hard 4-SAT benchmarks in residual energy, time-to-solution, and solution diversity.

Conclusion: Using reinforcement learning to train Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo algorithms effectively resolves the limitations of traditional MCMC approaches in combinatorial optimization challenges.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

*Hao Luan,Yi Xian Goh,See-Kiong Ng,Chun Kai Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a method to achieve constrained joint generation using multiple pre-trained diffusion models without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating correlated samples across multiple diffusion models while satisfying hard constraints, without expensive retraining, is a challenging task.

Method: The proposed PCD method introduces a coupled guidance term for coordinated generation and a projection step per diffusion iteration to enforce task-specific constraints.

Result: Empirical evaluations show PCD improves coordination among diffusion models and enforces constraints in applications like image generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot planning.

Conclusion: PCD achieves constrained joint generation effectively, balancing improved coupling, guaranteed constraint satisfaction, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Applm, a framework using xTrimoPGLM language model to improve allergen protein identification beyond existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Allergens pose significant public health challenges, urging efficient computational methods for accurate protein identification.

Method: Applm uses the xTrimoPGLM protein language model trained on vast protein sequence data to analyze differences and predict allergens in complex scenarios.

Result: Applm outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in real-world tasks including identifying novel allergens and assessing protein mutations.

Conclusion: The xTrimoPGLM model is critical for Applm's success, and open-source software along with benchmark datasets are provided to encourage further research.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

### [274] [Stabilizing Long-term Multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Gated Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10548)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward sparsity in long-horizon RL tasks, especially for software engineering, by proposing a framework and method to ensure better reward alignment and policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of reward sparsity and misalignment in RL tasks, where existing methods either introduce bias or struggle without task decomposition.

Method: The paper introduces the SWE-oriented RL Framework for multi-turn interaction and proposes Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), which accumulates rewards only when long-term thresholds are met.

Result: G-RA significantly improved completion and modification rates by up to 93.8% and 42.0% respectively, avoiding policy degradation.

Conclusion: Balanced reward accumulation is vital for long-horizon RL, and G-RA provides an effective solution for addressing reward misalignment.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATE-B, a tool using large language models to guide treatment effect estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited adoption of causal inference techniques due to complexity and expertise requirements.

Method: CATE-B integrates LLMs for causal model construction, robust adjustment identification, and regression method recommendation.

Result: CATE-B provides end-to-end guidance, offers benchmark tasks, and lowers barriers to causal analysis.

Conclusion: CATE-B enhances accessibility to treatment effect estimation and establishes new benchmarks in automation.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

### [276] [GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces unified learning, using graph representations to harmonize training across diverse deep learning model architectures (e.g., MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and improve their generalizability in medical imaging for domain-fracture scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training heterogeneous deep learning models for medical imaging tasks under domain-fracture scenarios, where distribution shifts occur due to variations across imaging techniques, patient demographics, and data formats.

Method: The proposed method represents individual models as graphs and optimizes them in a shared graph learning space through a unified GNN (uGNN). By decoupling model parameters and guiding unified optimization, it enables parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across diverse architectures and datasets.

Result: Unified learning significantly improves robustness to unseen data with large distribution shifts, as demonstrated on MorphoMNIST and two MedMNIST benchmarks (PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST). It shows strong performance when models are trained on distinct distributions and tested on mixed datasets.

Conclusion: Unified learning effectively improves generalizability and adaptability of heterogeneous models in medical imaging, overcoming challenges caused by domain fractures and distribution shifts. The approach supports coherent training across diverse architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

*Xuanhao Mu,Gökhan Demirel,Yuzhe Zhang,Jianlei Liu,Thorsten Schlachter,Veit Hagenmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper tackles the challenges in upsampling energy system model time series and proposes using Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series upsampling methods for energy network design often result in information loss or noise, while advanced methods face challenges like the need for high-resolution ground truth data.

Method: The paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Transformer (GAT) model, which trains without requiring high-resolution ground-truth data and focuses on improving upsampling quality.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 9% reduction in RMSE for upsampling tasks and a 13% improvement in accuracy for model predictive control applications compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Generative Adversarial Transformers present a viable unsupervised approach for improving the fidelity and applicability of upsampling in energy system modeling.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreeGAD introduces a novel, training-free approach for Graph Anomaly Detection, utilizing an affinity-gated residual encoder and anchor-guided statistical deviations to effectively identify anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GAD approaches struggle with high deployment costs and scalability issues due to complex and resource-intensive training processes. There’s evidence suggesting training may not play as significant a role in anomaly detection performance as initially thought.

Method: FreeGAD employs an affinity-gated residual encoder for generating anomaly-aware representations and uses anchor nodes for pseudo-normal and anomalous guides to compute anomaly scores through statistical deviations.

Result: Extensive experiments show FreeGAD’s superior performance, efficiency, and scalability across multiple benchmark datasets from varied domains without requiring any training or iterative optimization.

Conclusion: FreeGAD offers an effective and scalable alternative to traditional GAD methods by eliminating the need for training, which addresses deployment cost and scalability challenges while maintaining high detection accuracy.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trust in the predictions of deep networks by addressing reliability issues in their explanation methods.

Method: Introduced a probabilistic and spectral analysis framework, proposed remedies like standard perturbation scales and aggregation via SpectralLens.

Result: Spectral bias in gradient-based methods was identified, and theoretical results were validated with quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Proposed solutions provide more consistent and reliable explanations in deep network analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and address the security challenges in Split Learning, identifying vulnerabilities, attack types, and gaps in current defenses.

Method: Systematic review of attacks on Split Learning, classification based on attack roles and risks, and evaluation of cryptographic, data modification, and hybrid defenses.

Result: The study identifies security gaps in Split Learning methods, evaluating their strengths and limitations in handling privacy concerns.

Conclusion: This research highlights open challenges and proposes future directions to enhance the security and privacy of Split Learning systems.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses sample inefficiency in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) when using policy gradient methods, using variance-reduction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decision-making in scenarios with conflicting goals and enhance efficiency by overcoming sample inefficiency in policy gradients for MORL.

Method: Implementation of variance-reduction techniques in policy gradient methods for MORL under general assumptions.

Result: Proposed approach reduces sample complexity in MORL while retaining scalability for large state-action spaces.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the ability to optimize multiple objectives in MORL more effectively by addressing data inefficiency in policy gradient methods.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

*Lucas Cardoso,Vitor Santos,José Ribeiro Filho,Ricardo Prudêncio,Regiane Kawasaki,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Item Response Theory (IRT) for dataset partitioning in ML model validation, revealing diverse instance subgroups and improving bias-variance tradeoff evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data partitioning methods for ML validation often overlook the quality and heterogeneity of data instances. This paper aims to address this gap by integrating IRT for creating informed data splits.

Method: Item Response Theory (IRT) parameters were employed to assess instance quality and guide dataset partitioning. Several ML models were evaluated on four tabular datasets using IRT-based partitions.

Result: IRT-informed partitions unveiled instance heterogeneity and informative subgroups. Training ML models on high-guessing instances impaired accuracy (below 50%), while balanced partitions achieved over 70% accuracy on the same dataset.

Conclusion: IRT-based partitioning strategies enhance model validation by exposing biases and variance tradeoffs, highlighting informative subgroups, and improving prediction accuracy through better training data allocation.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) that integrates energy-based models and uses a decomposition approach for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the prediction of binding free energy changes ($\Delta\Delta G$), a critical task in protein and PPI engineering, which impacts drug discovery and optimization processes.

Method: The authors decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a sequence-based component (estimated via an inverse folding model) and a structure-based component (estimated via an energy-based model). Their method assumes equilibrium between bound and unbound states to simplify calculations.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods in predicting $\Delta\Delta G$ and optimizing antibodies, specifically demonstrated against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion: This study connects sequence-based approaches to binding energy prediction with physical energy-based models, showing that their framework not only incorporates a strong inductive bias but also achieves superior predictive performance.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Motivation: Multimodal sarcasm detection is complicated due to the need to identify complementary signals across modalities and avoid reliance on shortcut learning, which impairs generalization.

Method: The authors developed MUStARD++ by removing shortcut signals and introduced a Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model for efficient fusion of modalities in sarcasm detection.

Result: Experiments show that the MCIB model outperforms existing methods and generalizes better without relying on shortcuts.

Conclusion: Effective modality fusion is crucial for sarcasm detection, and the MCIB model enhances performance while addressing issues with shortcut learning.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

### [285] [SPHENIC: Topology-Informed Multi-View Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10646)
*Chenkai Guo,Yikai Zhu,Jing Yangum,Renxiang Guan,Por Lip Yee,Guangdun Peng,Dayu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHENIC, a novel machine learning approach for spatial-transcriptomics clustering, addresses issues in previously-used methods and achieves better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial-transcriptomics clustering requires improved strategies to handle noisy data and insufficient modeling of spatial neighborhoods.

Method: SPHENIC combines advanced topological embedding and a Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module for stable representation and refined spatial mappings.

Result: On 14 benchmark spatial transcriptomic datasets, SPHENIC outperforms previous methods by 3.31%-6.54% in clustering accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed SPHENIC method offers robust and accurate spatial clustering solutions, advancing state-of-the-art approaches in spatial-transcriptomics analysis.

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

### [286] [Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10649)
*Debvrat Varshney,Vibhas Vats,Bhartendu Pandey,Christa Brelsford,Philipe Dias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Generative AI-based approach for forecasting land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes, specifically impervious surfaces, using diffusion models, demonstrating better accuracy than a no-change baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes is critical for assessing risks to hydrologic systems and regional climate scenarios, yet current forecasting methods lack behind models for Earth system processes.

Method: The paper uses Generative AI, specifically diffusion models, to predict LULC changes as a data synthesis problem. Historical data across the U.S. and key generative model properties were utilized to forecast impervious surfaces over a decade.

Result: The diffusion-based method outperformed a no-change baseline across 12 metropolitan areas for resolutions $
\geq 0.7\times0.7km^2$, with lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE), showing it effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns from historical data.

Conclusion: Generative AI models, particularly diffusion models, hold promise for improving LULC change forecasting. Future directions involve leveraging auxiliary Earth data and enabling scenario-specific simulations using driver variables.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph classification method by converting graph data into tabular form using Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm variants and applying tabular methods for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve graph classification methods by leveraging tabular data techniques, seeking similar accuracy to existing methods but with higher efficiency in time or memory.

Method: The study involves exploring multiple Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm variants, theoretically analyzing their expressive power, testing them on 12 benchmark datasets, and comparing results to graph neural networks and graph kernels.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to graph neural networks and graph kernels, while being more efficient in either time or memory depending on the dataset.

Conclusion: Transforming graph data to tabular format through Weisfeiler-Leman variants offers a competitive and efficient alternative for graph classification.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing
graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying
methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of
Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical
framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their
expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

### [288] [REFN: A Reinforcement-Learning-From-Network Framework against 1-day/n-day Exploitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10701)
*Tianlong Yu,Lihong Liu,Ziyi Zhou,Fudu Xing,Kailong Wang,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFN (Reinforcement Learning From Network) leverages LLMs and RL techniques to autonomously generate network filters, aiming to prevent 1-day or n-day exploitations across devices with heightened scalability, compatibility, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses against vulnerabilities are inadequate due to scalability challenges with diverse devices, compatibility issues in legacy systems, and error-prone manual patching processes.

Method: REFN utilizes LLMs trained through a reinforcement learning framework to generate network filters. It incorporates Agentic RAG-based Knowledge Distillation, RL From VNF Pipeline, and Online Agentic Validation to enhance training efficiency and accuracy.

Result: REFN achieved a 21.1% higher accuracy than alternative methods and reduced the Mean Time To Patch to 3.65 hours. It demonstrated scalability by adapting to networks of up to 10,000 devices.

Conclusion: REFN represents a promising approach for deploying autonomous defense mechanisms against widespread vulnerabilities, ensuring improved efficiency, accuracy, and scalability compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

*Murat Temiz,Vemund Bakken*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-based simulation framework using open-source EM software for machine learning applications in antenna design, demonstrating significant speed improvements over CPUs and comparable accuracy to commercial software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges posed by the computational complexity of EM simulations for machine learning antenna design, which require large datasets for training algorithms.

Method: The researchers utilized GPU acceleration with open-source EM simulation software to generate extensive datasets and compared results with commercial EM software, also benchmarking GPU vs. CPU computational performance.

Result: Entry-level GPUs outperform high-end CPUs, and high-end gaming GPUs provide up to 18x better performance; open-source EM software achieves similar accuracy to commercial tools for microstrip antennas with sufficient spatial resolution.

Conclusion: GPU-based simulations significantly enhance computational efficiency for antenna design while maintaining accuracy, making it feasible for machine learning applications relying on large datasets.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

*Kejia Fan,Jianheng Tang,Zhirui Yang,Feijiang Han,Jiaxu Li,Run He,Yajiang Huang,Anfeng Liu,Houbing Herbert Song,Yunhuai Liu,Huiping Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL), a framework addressing non-IID data issues in personalized federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL methods struggle with handling non-IID data, limiting effectiveness in collective generalization and personalization.

Method: APFL employs a frozen foundation model for feature extraction and dual analytic streams—one for global generalization and another for local client personalization.

Result: APFL demonstrates heterogeneity invariance with theoretical guarantees and improves accuracy by 1.10%-15.45% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: APFL effectively tackles non-IID data issues in PFL, offering enhanced personalization and generalization capabilities validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

*Zhipeng Chen,Xiaobo Qin,Youbin Wu,Yue Ling,Qinghao Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) by proposing the use of Pass@k as a reward metric to balance exploration and exploitation, showing improvements in exploration and offering an innovative analytical solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning with the traditional Pass@1 reward struggles with balancing exploration and exploitation, often leading to conservative policies and local optima. The motivation is to identify better reward metrics like Pass@k that can improve exploration.

Method: The authors employed Pass@k as the reward metric to train policies, derived an analytical solution for its advantages, and explored designs for the advantage function in RLVR.

Result: Using Pass@k as the reward improves exploration capability, reveals the mutual enhancement between exploration and exploitation, and makes advantage function design directly feasible.

Conclusion: Pass@k rewards can address RLVR challenges, offering a promising direction for future work on advantage function design and effective reward metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improvement to transformers for large physical system datasets by combining the Erwin architecture with Native Sparse Attention (NSA), resolving challenges related to quadratic scaling of attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in the attention mechanism of transformers when applied to large physical systems, and to improve the computational efficiency and scalability.

Method: The authors adapted NSA for non-sequential data, implemented the Erwin NSA model, and tested it on datasets such as cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air pressure modeling.

Result: The updated model achieves performance matching or exceeding the original Erwin model, proving its effectiveness across three physical science datasets.

Conclusion: The Erwin NSA model provides a scalable and efficient solution for applying transformers to large-scale physical systems, validating its improvements through robust experiments and successful reproduction of prior results.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBEX is introduced as a coarse-to-fine pipeline to improve structure-based drug designs under data scarcity, enhancing model generalization and performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of publicly available protein-ligand complexes, which restricts structure-based drug discovery pipelines and leads to overfitting on scarce data.

Method: The paper employs the PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to optimize sample information density, guiding generalization through scaffold hopping rather than conventional tasks. It uses the TargetDiff model succeeded by physics-based optimization.

Result: IBEX achieves a 64% zero-shot docking success rate (vs 53%), improves mean Vina scores, boosts QED by 25%, and reduces extrapolation error while maintaining compatibility with binding pockets.

Conclusion: IBEX improves transfer performance, docking success, and various important metrics, establishing a robust framework for drug designs under limited data availability.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in non-stationary restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problems by developing an algorithm that adapts to dynamic transitions, achieving a novel regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RMAB models assume stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which don't hold for real-world applications like healthcare and recommendation systems due to non-stationary dynamics.

Method: The authors developed the \rmab\ algorithm, combining sliding window reinforcement learning with an upper confidence bound (UCB) framework to learn non-stationary transition dynamics and their variations.

Result: The \rmab\ algorithm achieves a theoretical regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$, validated using relaxed regret definitions.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational approach for tackling non-stationary RMAB problems, addressing core theoretical and practical challenges.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Motivation: Address the critical limitations of Transformer architectures in maintaining long-term memory and adaptability, inspired by memory principles in neuroscience.

Method: Propose a unified framework combining neuroscience-based memory mechanisms with engineering enhancements in Transformers, organized by functional objectives, memory representations, and integration mechanisms.

Result: Analyzes core memory operations while highlighting recent engineering methods, identifying challenges like scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions in memory integration.

Conclusion: The synthesis outlines advancements and challenges, offering guidance for developing Transformers inspired by cognitive memory systems for lifelong learning.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a structured framework for Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML) to unify and simplify the implementation and evaluation of data minimization principles in AI/ML applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address confusion among practitioners on implementing data minimization principles and navigating terminology across various research areas, especially for ML applications where DM is critical.

Method: The authors present a comprehensive DMML framework featuring components like a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of minimization. They systematically review the literature and methodologies related to DMML.

Result: A structured overview of DMML is provided, enabling clearer implementation and evaluation of DM principles by practitioners and researchers.

Conclusion: The work facilitates broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML by presenting a unified framework, bridging gaps in understanding across communities.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

### [297] [Efficiently Verifiable Proofs of Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10866)
*Ari Karchmer,Seth Neel,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interactive verification protocol allowing resource-constrained parties to efficiently verify data attributions calculated by computationally powerful entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the trust issue of verifying data attributions generated by computationally rich parties, ensuring resource-constrained parties can validate critical outputs with efficiency.

Method: An interactive proof protocol where a Prover calculates data attributions and a Verifier ensures correctness using Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) guarantees, requiring minimal computational effort.

Result: The protocol guarantees that Verifier can verify attributions close to optimal with efficiency scaling as O(1/ε), independent of dataset size.

Conclusion: The proposed approach reduces computational constraints and boosts trust in data attributions, making it broadly applicable across attribution tasks.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces \ourdataset, a literature-derived dataset of design priors to enhance AI-driven therapeutic development and discusses its effectiveness in improving safety and performance when designing novel molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance AI-driven therapeutic design models with stronger experimental priors to avoid risks such as mutagenic proposals and improve their utility and safety across design problems.

Method: The authors create \ourdataset using LLM pipelines to extract and summarize natural language facts about therapeutic compounds and represent them as pairs of facts and entities (e.g., SMILES IDs). The dataset is applied for training models and evaluated on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons.

Result: The dataset improves model performance on regression and classification tasks, outpacing larger models while using fewer parameters, and is also shown to produce safer molecule designs in GuacaMol optimization tasks.

Conclusion: \ourdataset effectively enhances AI-driven therapeutic design by introducing strong priors, reducing implicit constraint violations, and improving both safety and performance. It is made publicly available for further expansion and research.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

### [299] [Empirical Investigation into Configuring Echo State Networks for Representative Benchmark Problem Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10887)
*Brooke R. Weborg,Gursel Serpen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This work studies the performance of Echo State Networks (ESNs) through benchmark problems and provides practical heuristics for configuring their architecture and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and configuring Echo State Networks require domain expertise. Many newcomers face challenges in optimizing architectural parameters for desired outcomes.

Method: Using four benchmark tasks, this paper examines the effects of architectural changes and parameter adjustments on the performance of Echo State Networks.

Result: The study provides insights into how parameter tuning and architecture choices impact ESN performance across different problem areas.

Conclusion: Practical heuristics for ESN configuration are offered, enabling effective design and selection of parameters for differing applications within its domain.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

### [300] [Meta-Metrics and Best Practices for System-Level Inference Performance Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10251)
*Shweta Salaria,Zhuoran Liu,Nelson Mimura Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: This paper introduces FMwork, a benchmarking framework for evaluating Large Language Models' inference performance, achieving notable efficiency improvements while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating inference performance of Foundation Models is complex due to interactions between hardware and software, making complete experimental testing impractical.

Method: The authors propose FMwork, consisting of benchmarking best practices like meta-metrics, parameter selection, and strategic cost-performance evaluation.

Result: Experiments with FMwork yield up to 24x improvements in speed/resource efficiency and maintain a high accuracy rate (96.6%) with reduced computational output.

Conclusion: FMwork provides a structured and efficient way to benchmark Foundation Models, enabling performance gains without significant accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Benchmarking inference performance (speed) of Foundation Models such as Large
Language Models (LLM) involves navigating a vast experimental landscape to
understand the complex interactions between hardware and software components.
However, evaluating every possible test configuration is impractical,
unfeasible and unnecessary. To address this challenge, we introduce FMwork, a
comprehensive and methodical approach to creating a controlled testing
environment that accurately reflects and characterizes performance. FMwork
comprises a set of benchmkaring best practices with three key components: 1)
meta-metrics, 2) parameter selection, and 3) strategic cost-performance
evaluation. Meta-metrics account for time and resources spent on benchmarking
and the relative accuracy of the results compared to a larger body of
measurements, representing the complete experimental space. FMwork
operationalizes the meta-metrics and provides efficient strategies for
parameter selection and cost-performance analysis. Using the framework, we show
up to 24x improvement (speedup and/or resource savings) running sweeps of
experiments compared to the ground truth. Even already considering a subset of
experiments as reference point (using the power of two for batch sizes),
reducing experimental output size from 1024 to 128 tokens yields another 2.7x
gain while keeping 96.6% accuracy for an evaluation using Llama 3.1 8B model.

### [301] [Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781)
*Abtin Molavi,Amanda Xu,Ethan Cecchetti,Swamit Tannu,Aws Albarghouthi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an automatic generation approach for qubit mapping and routing (QMR) compilers tailored to different quantum architectures, ensuring broad compatibility and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing quantum computation by automatically generating QMR compilers that fit the diverse and evolving landscape of quantum hardware and architectures.

Method: A device state machine is used to formulate an abstract QMR problem, leading to the introduction of a domain-specific language (Marol), which simplifies QMR specification and enables the development of a parametric solver that can adapt to any quantum architecture.

Result: The approach yields competitive results, producing compilers that match the runtime and solution quality of specialized, manually-designed compilers. Multiple case studies of noisy and fault-tolerant architectures demonstrate its robustness.

Conclusion: The method streamlines the development of quantum compilers, offering a scalable and adaptable solution as quantum hardware rapidly evolves.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

*Xu Ma,Jiajie Zhang,Fujing Xie,Sören Schwertfeger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a WiFi-based localization system that utilizes OpenStreetMap Area Graph for improved indoor localization accuracy, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide accurate and scalable localization for robots in GPS-denied indoor environments by leveraging ubiquitous wireless infrastructure and geometric/topological priors.

Method: The framework employs signal propagation modeling and osmAG for localization. It uses optimization algorithms offline to localize WiFi APs and leverages an augmented map for online real-time robot localization.

Result: The approach achieves a mean error of 3.79m in AP localization (35.3% better than trilateration) and real-time localization errors of 3.12m (8.77% improvement) in fingerprinted and 3.83m (81.05% improvement) in non-fingerprinted areas.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates superior scalability, accuracy, and space efficiency, validated in a large, multi-floor environment, and effectively addresses the kidnapped robot problem.

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/XuMa369/osmag-wifi-localization.

*Matthew D. Osburn,Cameron K. Peterson,John L. Salmon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a method to find optimal, collision-free trajectories in dynamic environments using Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), avoiding the need for an initial solver guess.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in trajectory planning in dynamic environments, where spatial and temporal constraints complicate the problem of generating an initial guess for numerical solvers.

Method: The authors leverage the Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) framework to create optimal, collision-free trajectories without requiring an initial solver guess. They further derive GCS-compatible constraints and adapt them to the framework for general use.

Result: ST-GCS generates equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS in static environments and successfully computes minimum-distance collision-free paths in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets is presented as a viable method for trajectory optimization in both static and dynamic settings, offering a systematic way to handle complex constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Method: Utilizes a data-driven approach with a Hankel matrix-based representation for system dynamics and step-to-step transitions, integrating foot contact scheduling with continuous trajectory planning.

Result: Validated on the Atalante exoskeleton, the method demonstrates improved robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The HDDPC framework provides an efficient, unified solution for robust and reactive bipedal locomotion through online motion replanning.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically
react to changes in the environment in real time. This paper introduces the
hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the
data-enabled predictive control, that addresses these challenges by
simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain
trajectories. The proposed framework utilizes a Hankel matrix-based
representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,
unified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and
reactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the
Atalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper identifies shortcomings in Vision-Language-Action models regarding visual attention allocation and proposes ReconVLA, which uses an implicit grounding method to enhance visual attention with reconstruction techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle to allocate visual attention effectively, hindering precise robotic manipulation.

Method: The authors introduce ReconVLA, where a diffusion transformer conditioned on visual outputs reconstructs an object's gaze region to guide visual attention.

Result: Experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate improvement in manipulation precision and generalization through the implicit grounding method.

Conclusion: ReconVLA improves visual attention allocation in robotic agents, enabling precise manipulation and better generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BEASST, a novel adaptive robotic framework, enhances source seeking through behavioral entropy, combining exploration and exploitation for optimized navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robotic framework that improves source-seeking performance in complex and unknown environments by efficiently managing exploration and exploitation behaviors.

Method: BEASST uses normalized signal strength modeled as a surrogate probability of source location while employing Behavioral Entropy and Prelec's probability weighting function to dynamically adjust robot risk behavior.

Result: Experimental tests show BEASST reduces path length by 15% and speeds up source localization by 20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in DARPA SubT and multi-room setups.

Conclusion: BEASST successfully enhances robotic source-seeking tasks with theoretical convergence guarantees and practical stability, demonstrating reliable performance and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length
and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven
navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious
exploration.

*Wenqi Zheng,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal approach for human activity recognition using reinforcement learning to adapt large language models with limited data, improving both generalization and reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of human activity recognition (HAR) in scenarios with constrained fine-tuning data, leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Method: A multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates candidate responses with reasoning traces and answers for activity images, evaluated using reward functions. The model is optimized via the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.

Result: Experiments across four HAR datasets and five settings reveal the method's enhanced performance, demonstrating its ability to adapt effectively with few samples.

Conclusion: The proposed FAVOR framework successfully extends visual reinforcement learning to HAR domains, showing improved recognition, reasoning, and explainability in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

### [308] [A Semantic-Aware Framework for Safe and Intent-Integrative Assistance in Upper-Limb Exoskeletons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10378)
*Yu Chen,Shu Miao,Chunyu Wu,Jingsong Mu,Bo OuYang,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic-aware framework integrating large language models into task planning for upper-limb exoskeletons, enabling adaptive, safe, and intent-driven assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing upper-limb exoskeletons lack task semantic understanding and collaborative planning capabilities with users, limiting their adaptability and generalizability in home-care scenarios.

Method: The framework uses transparent mode to capture wearer intent, extracts semantic task information, configures assistive parameters, detects anomalies via a diffusion-based system, and employs online trajectory refinement and impedance control during execution.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the proposed system aligns with wearer cognition, adapts to varying task semantics, and reliably responds to anomalies.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic-awareness with advanced anomaly detection and online control methods enhances the adaptability, safety, and cognitive alignment of upper-limb exoskeletons for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to generate dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse data, specifically targeting low-cost non-repeating scanning LiDARs (NRS-LiDARs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost LiDARs produce sparse data, limiting their effectiveness in perception tasks. This work aims to overcome this challenge by densifying LiDAR data for broader applications.

Method: The authors create a framework that includes reflectance calibration, adapting to dynamic scenes, and leveraging specific attributes of NRS-LiDAR. They also propose a densification network and provide a related dataset.

Result: The authors successfully generate dense LiDAR reflectance images, demonstrating applications in loop closure and traffic lane detection.

Conclusion: This work extends the utility of low-cost LiDAR sensors by addressing sparsity issues, enabling their use in various real-world robotic perception tasks.

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

Result: Large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, feedback mechanisms, and learning approaches in embodied AI.

Conclusion: Significant progress has been made, but challenges remain; future directions for research are discussed in the survey.

Abstract: Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable
of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world
environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied
agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open
dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized
embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In
this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered
embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We
investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms,
detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution,
and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For
embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating
on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning
in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of
embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing
decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved,
challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey,
potentially as the further research directions.

*Zhuoyuan Yu,Yuxing Long,Zihan Yang,Chengyan Zeng,Hongwei Fan,Jiyao Zhang,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-correcting paradigm for vision-and-language navigation models called Self-correction Flywheel. It emphasizes using error trajectories for continuous improvement and improves navigation success rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-and-language navigation models struggle to recover from errors due to a lack of effective error correction mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose a post-training method called Self-correction Flywheel, which emphasizes leveraging the model's error trajectories as a data source. This method generates self-correction data to improve navigation through iterative flywheel updates.

Result: The proposed CorrectNav model achieved state-of-the-art success rates of 65.1% on R2R-CE and 69.3% on RxR-CE benchmarks, significantly surpassing previous models. Real-world tests also highlighted its advantages in error correction, obstacle avoidance, and long instruction adherence.

Conclusion: The Self-correction Flywheel paradigm demonstrates a compelling approach to enhancing vision-and-language navigation models by converting errors into opportunities for continuous improvement, paving the way for advancements in autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face challenges in implementing and maintaining robotic systems due to limited expertise, leading to external dependencies and vendor lock-in. Similar issues arise in academia when integrating robots into larger intelligent systems.

Method: The authors developed a software framework with an abstraction layer to streamline the interfaces of modern robotic systems, ensuring compatibility across different manufacturers and models. They implemented a prototype in Python.

Result: The framework was practically tested in a bin-picking cell setup using the Yaskawa Motoman GP4 robot.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully simplifies robotic system deployment, potentially reducing external dependency for SMEs and aiding researchers in integrating robots into broader systems.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a

*Qi Liu,Xiaopeng Zhang,Mingshan Tan,Shuaikang Ma,Jinliang Ding,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called MASH, where each limb of a humanoid robot is treated as an independent agent in a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to improve locomotion and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize humanoid robot locomotion using novel strategies that leverage cooperative and heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning, surpassing the limitations of existing single-agent methods.

Method: The proposed MASH framework treats each limb of a humanoid robot as an independent agent and applies cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning, sharing a global critic for collaborative decision-making.

Result: Experimental results showed that MASH accelerates training convergence and enhances whole-body cooperation, outperforming conventional single-agent reinforcement learning approaches.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new paradigm by integrating MARL into single humanoid locomotion control, advancing both training efficiency and cooperative abilities of humanoid robots.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

### [314] [KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511)
*Andrea Rosasco,Federico Ceola,Giulia Pasquale,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses a method to improve Diffusion Policy for robot behavior cloning by introducing KDPE (Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy) to filter out harmful outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving state-of-the-art robot behavior cloning policies like Diffusion Policy, which suffer from quality degradation during execution and outlier learning from training data.

Method: Proposing KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation framework, utilizing a manifold-aware kernel to detect and filter harmful trajectories in output, mitigating outliers and stochastic issues while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: KDPE outperforms the Diffusion Policy in both simulated single-arm robot tasks and real-world robot experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed KDPE improves the robustness and reliability of diffusion-based cloning policies in robotics by handling harmful trajectory outputs effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework, MLM, enabling a robotic quadruped with a 6-DoF arm to perform multi-task whole-body loco-manipulation autonomously or under teleoperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient, multi-task control for quadruped robots equipped with arms remains difficult, requiring a balance between locomotion and manipulation in real-world and simulated environments.

Method: The authors propose MLM, leveraging real-world and simulation data, alongside an adaptive sampling mechanism and Trajectory-Velocity Prediction network for effective policy learning and execution.

Result: The controller achieved whole-body behaviors, succeeded in zero-shot transfer to real-world scenarios, and displayed effective multi-task execution in experiments on a Go2 robot equipped with an Airbot robotic arm.

Conclusion: The MLM framework demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of combining adaptive reinforcement learning and predictive trajectory modeling for advanced, practical quadruped loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

*Agnes Axelsson,Merle Reimann,Ronald Cumbal,Hannah Pelikan,Divesh Lala*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes using ethnographic vignettes to document and highlight failures in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems that are often omitted in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-Robot Interactions (HRI) still face sub-optimal performance compared to human-human interactions, especially due to context-dependent and undocumented failures.

Method: The paper introduces ethnographic vignettes as a method and describes how they can be specifically designed to document contextual and rare failures in HRI.

Result: The proposed vignettes enable the communication of system failures from multi-disciplinary perspectives, enhance transparency regarding robot capabilities, and document unexpected behaviors.

Conclusion: Ethnographic vignettes serve as a complementary tool to traditional HRI evaluation methods, promoting deeper insights and documentation of failures.

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

### [317] [Synthesis of Deep Neural Networks with Safe Robust Adaptive Control for Reliable Operation of Wheeled Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10634)
*Mehdi Heydari Shahna,Jouni Mattila*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical control policy combining deep neural networks (DNNs) and model-free robust adaptive control (RAC) to ensure precise control and safety of heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) amid disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing control precision and system safety for heavy-duty WMRs, which face challenges like strict safety standards, faults, and external disturbances.

Method: Designed a hierarchical framework with DNN as the primary control policy for precision and responsiveness, backed by two safety layers using RAC and shutdown mechanisms to handle disturbances.

Result: The combined DNN-RAC approach enables uniform exponential stability and adheres to safety standards. Real-time experiments with a 6,000 kg WMR validated the system's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The integration of DNN and RAC ensures robust, high-precision control while maintaining safety, providing stability and compliance for heavy-duty WMRs in real-world operations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dedicated simulation tools for accurately modeling the deformation of magnetic soft robots under external magnetic fields.

Method: The authors developed a user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), allowing real-time observation of deformations and integration of material properties and magnetic fields.

Result: The tool demonstrates its functionality with four benchmark models: a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly, proving its usability and accessibility.

Conclusion: The software is accessible for both beginners and advanced researchers, with planned future improvements to enhance accuracy and validation against finite element solvers.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

*Matteo Luperto,Valerii Stakanov,Giacomo Boracchi,Nicola Basilico,Francesco Amigoni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using saliency maps derived from neural networks to prioritize exploration of significant areas by robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve autonomous robot exploration by addressing the gap in existing strategies that overlook prioritizing high-interest areas.

Method: The proposed method identifies 'saliency areas' via saliency maps generated from neural networks to guide exploration strategies.

Result: Experimental campaigns demonstrate that leveraging saliency areas significantly enhances robot exploration behavior.

Conclusion: Prioritizing salient regions can improve exploration speed and map comprehensiveness in unknown environments.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

*Alessandro Adami,Aris Synodinos,Matteo Iovino,Ruggero Carli,Pietro Falco*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops an automated framework for generating Stack of Tasks (SoT) configurations using Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming, enabling robots to dynamically manage redundancy and adapt to changing requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of manually designed Stack of Tasks frameworks in robotics, which restrict adaptability and require expert intervention.

Method: The paper combines Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming to automatically optimize the task hierarchy and parameters based on user-defined objectives and a cost function emphasizing precision, safety, and execution time.

Result: Experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform demonstrated that the learned SoTs allow dynamic adaptation to changing environments and competing objectives while ensuring reliable task execution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances redundancy management, making robot programming more adaptable and accessible, and reducing reliance on expert-designed systems.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

### [321] [The SET Perceptual Factors Framework: Towards Assured Perception for Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10798)
*Troi Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SET Perceptual Factors Framework to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous system perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need to ensure safe and trustworthy robot perception in autonomous systems, which are susceptible to failures due to environmental and sensor-related factors.

Method: The authors developed the SET (Self, Environment, and Target) Perceptual Factors Framework, including SET State Trees and SET Factor Trees, to identify and model perceptual risks for tasks like object detection and pose estimation.

Result: The framework systematically categorizes and quantifies how environmental and self-related factors impact perception in autonomous systems, allowing for better understanding and risk modeling.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates rigorous safety assurances, enhances transparent communication of perceptual risks, and promotes trust in autonomous systems by addressing reliability concerns.

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

*Henry Powell,Guy Laban,Emily S. Cross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a computational model that helps social robots understand human self-disclosure, achieving improved results using a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots need to understand human self-disclosure to establish relationships in varied social contexts, but current systems lack this capability.

Method: A custom multimodal attention network was trained on a self-disclosure video corpus using a novel scale-preserving cross entropy loss function.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.83, significantly outperforming the best baseline model by 0.48.

Conclusion: The study contributes to enabling social robots to recognize self-disclosures, advancing their social cognition capabilities.

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

*Yizhi Zhou,Ziwei Kang,Jiawei Xia,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a consistent visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system that improves localization accuracy by addressing calibration uncertainty and preserving system observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on resolving inconsistency issues in UWB-aided visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems, primarily caused by neglecting calibration uncertainty and failing to preserve system observability.

Method: A Lie group-based CVIRO system is proposed, which incorporates UWB anchor states into the estimation to jointly calculate robot and anchor positions while ensuring observability consistency using invariant error properties.

Result: The proposed CVIRO algorithm maintains the correct unobservable subspace by design and demonstrates superior localization accuracy and consistency in both simulations and experiments.

Conclusion: CVIRO provides a more reliable and consistent approach to UWB-aided VIO systems, resolving key issues of calibration and observability while enhancing localization performance.

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework using the A2C algorithm to optimize satellite orbital parameters for better Earth observation while handling LEO congestion and collision risks. A2C outperforms PPO in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges caused by growing LEO congestion, which complicates satellite deployment and increases the risk of collisions with space debris.

Method: The authors employ reinforcement learning (specifically the A2C algorithm) within a custom simulation environment to model satellite dynamics and optimize orbital parameters for precise terrestrial coverage.

Result: The A2C algorithm outperforms PPO, achieving 5.8x higher cumulative rewards and converging 31.5x faster, making it suitable for real-time mission planning.

Conclusion: This study validates reinforcement learning, particularly the A2C algorithm, as an effective, computationally efficient approach for adaptable and scalable LEO mission planning.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

TL;DR: FormalGrad introduces a framework to enhance LLM-generated code using formal methods for guaranteed robustness and efficiency, achieving significant benchmark improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel in code generation but often fail to meet strict requirements for correctness, robustness, and efficiency in constrained domains.

Method: FormalGrad employs structured feedback and formal constraints in an iterative LLM-enhanced loop, using a pseudo-gradient to refine solutions consistently.

Result: Evaluations on HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench show FormalGrad surpasses baselines, achieving up to 27% absolute improvement and 41% relative improvement.

Conclusion: FormalGrad ensures functional, robust, and efficient code generation, making it suitable for critical AI-assisted software development tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Saracoder, a hierarchical framework for improving repository-level code completion, focusing on fixing issues related to redundancy, ambiguity, and lack of diversity in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented code completion systems suffer from semantic misguidance, redundancy, and symbol ambiguity due to reliance on shallow text similarity.

Method: Saracoder employs a Hierarchical Feature Optimization module for refining code retrieval, removing duplicates, measuring structural similarity, and optimizing diversity. Additionally, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator addresses cross-file symbol ambiguities.

Result: Saracoder achieves significant performance improvements on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks across multiple programming languages.

Conclusion: Refining retrieval results holistically enhances the accuracy and robustness of repository-level code completion systems, presenting a new framework paradigm.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes the task of Next Edit Prediction to predict developers' next code edits by leveraging interaction history and presents a dataset, evaluation benchmarks, and model evaluations for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face a suboptimal experience with current AI coding tools, as code completion is limited to cursor-based suggestions and chat-based editing disrupts workflow through context-switching.

Method: The authors define the Next Edit Prediction task, curate a supervised fine-tuning dataset, establish an evaluation benchmark, and perform model fine-tuning and evaluations to improve edit suggestions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations of the fine-tuned and baseline models reveal novel insights and demonstrate the utility of the Next Edit Prediction task.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for a proactive and seamless interaction paradigm in code editing, anticipating developer actions instead of merely responding to explicit commands.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

*Ajibode Adekunle,Abdul Ali Bangash,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study analyzes the lack of synchronization and coordination issues in pretrained language model development across GitHub and Hugging Face platforms, highlighting risks like fragmented updates and structural disconnects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in coordinating PTLM development and release between GitHub repositories and Hugging Face distribution, and ensure consistency and traceability in the workflow.

Method: A mixed-method analysis of 325 PTLM families and their 904 Hugging Face variants to examine commit activities, synchronization aspects, and patterns across both platforms.

Result: Eight distinct synchronization patterns were identified, revealing structural disconnects. Examples include isolated changes, platform abandonment, and fragmented updates.

Conclusion: Recognizing and addressing synchronization patterns is essential to enhance oversight, traceability, and coordination in PTLM cross-platform release practices.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

### [329] [Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517)
*Likai Ye,Mengliang Li,Dehai Zhao,Jiamou Sun,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies challenges in Solidity version migration and introduces SMCFIXER, a framework combining expert knowledge and LLMs to significantly improve Solidity compilation error resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the challenges developers face while migrating Solidity code across versions due to compilation errors and maintenance issues.

Method: The authors evaluate the performance of various LLMs in resolving Solidity compilation errors during version migrations, analyze their limitations, and propose a new framework called SMCFIXER, which combines context-aware code slicing, expert knowledge retrieval, and iterative patch generation.

Result: SMCFIXER showed a 24.24% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline GPT-4o for Solidity version migration tasks, achieving a success rate of 96.97%.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation and integration of expert knowledge with LLMs are crucial for effectively resolving Solidity version migration errors. SMCFIXER provides a robust solution to overcome this challenge.

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on
real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

*Souhaila Serbout,Diana Carolina Muñoz Hurtado,Hassan Atwi,Edoardo Riggio,Cesare Pautasso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoScat is a visualization tool designed to help researchers analyze large software evolution datasets using interactive density scatterplots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in temporally scaling and visualizing large datasets from software projects' evolution.

Method: Proposes an interactive density scatterplot tool (EvoScat) for visualizing temporal data, enabling flexible history scaling, color-mapping, sorting, and alignment.

Result: EvoScat enables scalable analysis of evolution datasets, facilitating artifact comparisons and deep dives into histories of popular open-source projects.

Conclusion: EvoScat provides an effective means for characterizing and comparing the evolution of software artifacts over time, improving empirical software engineering research capabilities.

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the integration of diverse scientific methods and analyses by establishing equivalences across multiple domains, particularly in unsupervised learning, network science, imaging, and network neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle issues arising from fragmented scientific analyses such as circular reasoning and redundant explanations by achieving better integration of diverse datasets and methodologies.

Method: The authors describe equivalences across clustering and dimensionality reduction, network measures and dynamics, and propose integrative algorithms and vignettes for simplifying popular scientific methods.

Result: The study unified various analyses across unsupervised learning, network science, imaging neuroscience, and network neuroscience and introduced the 'abct' toolbox as a practical implementation tool.

Conclusion: By establishing connections among diverse methodologies, the work advances scientific integration, improving clarity and reducing redundancy across multiple research domains.

Abstract: Modern scientific fields face the challenge of integrating a wealth of data,
analyses, and results. We recently showed that a neglect of this integration
can lead to circular analyses and redundant explanations. Here, we help advance
scientific integration by describing equivalences that unify diverse analyses
of datasets and networks. We describe equivalences across analyses of
clustering and dimensionality reduction, network centrality and dynamics, and
popular models in imaging and network neuroscience. First, we equate
foundational objectives across unsupervised learning and network science (from
k means to modularity to UMAP), fuse classic algorithms for optimizing these
objectives, and extend these objectives to simplify interpretations of popular
dimensionality reduction methods. Second, we equate basic measures of
connectional magnitude and dispersion with six measures of communication,
control, and diversity in network science and network neuroscience. Third, we
describe three semi-analytical vignettes that clarify and simplify the
interpretation of structural and dynamical analyses in imaging and network
neuroscience. We illustrate our results on example brain-imaging data and
provide abct, an open multi-language toolbox that implements our analyses.
Together, our study unifies diverse analyses across unsupervised learning,
network science, imaging neuroscience, and network neuroscience.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper argues for transforming scientific infrastructure into a dynamic and AI-aligned ecosystem, using neuroscience as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current static and fragmented scientific infrastructures lead to inefficiencies, data silos, and hindered progress, especially given the growth of neuroscience data and its clinical relevance.

Method: Proposes operational guidelines for creating an intelligent, decentralized, self-learning infrastructure leveraging AI technologies, ensuring global coordination and addressing underfunding.

Result: A dynamic ecosystem that enables seamless human-AI collaboration, accelerates discovery, improves reproducibility, and translates scientific understanding into societal benefits.

Conclusion: Prioritizing intelligent infrastructure is crucial for overcoming current scientific limitations and setting a transformative example for other domains.

Abstract: Infrastructure shapes societies and scientific discovery. Traditional
scientific infrastructure, often static and fragmented, leads to issues like
data silos, lack of interoperability and reproducibility, and unsustainable
short-lived solutions. Our current technical inability and social reticence to
connect and coordinate scientific research and engineering leads to
inefficiencies and impedes progress. With AI technologies changing how we
interact with the world around us, there is an opportunity to transform
scientific processes. Neuroscience's exponential growth of multimodal and
multiscale data, and urgent clinical relevance demand an infrastructure itself
learns, coordinates, and improves. Using neuroscience as a stress test, this
perspective argues for a paradigm shift: infrastructure must evolve into a
dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to accelerate science. Building on several
existing principles for data, collective benefit, and digital repositories, I
recommend operational guidelines for implementing them to create this dynamic
ecosystem, aiming to foster a decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting
system where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly. Addressing the chronic
underfunding of scientific infrastructure, acknowledging diverse contributions
beyond publications, and coordinating global efforts are critical steps for
this transformation. By prioritizing an intelligent infrastructure as a central
scientific instrument for knowledge generation, we can overcome current
limitations, accelerate discovery, ensure reproducibility and ethical
practices, and ultimately translate neuroscientific understanding into tangible
societal benefits, setting a blueprint for other scientific domains.

### [333] [Large Language Models Show Signs of Alignment with Human Neurocognition During Abstract Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10057)
*Christopher Pinier,Sonia Acuña Vargas,Mariia Steeghs-Turchina,Dora Matzke,Claire E. Stevenson,Michael D. Nunez*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study examines whether large language models (LLMs) reflect human cognitive processes during abstract reasoning, using performance comparisons and neural representation analyses via EEG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore if LLMs possess cognitive mechanisms akin to human neurocognition in tasks involving abstract reasoning, laying groundwork for connecting biological and artificial intelligence.

Method: The study compared human participants' performance with that of eight open-source LLMs on an abstract pattern completion task, analyzing task accuracy and fixation-related potentials (FRPs) recorded via EEG. Representational clustering and correlations between human and LLM neural patterns were also investigated.

Result: Only LLMs with ~70 billion parameters matched human accuracy, with some (Qwen-2.5-72B, DeepSeek-R1-70B) showing similarities in difficulty profiles. Representations of abstract pattern categories clustered distinctively in LLMs' intermediate layers, and these clusters aligned better with human frontal FRPs as task performance improved.

Conclusion: LLMs appear to share some neurocognitive principles with humans during abstract reasoning, suggesting potential parallels between artificial and biological intelligence mechanisms.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

### [334] [Excessive Screen Time is Associated with Mental Health Problems and ADHD in US Children and Adolescents: Physical Activity and Sleep as Parallel Mediators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10062)
*Ying Dai,Na Ouyang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigated the impact of excessive screen time on mental health issues and ADHD in children and adolescents during the pandemic, highlighting the role of physical activity, bedtime regularity, and sleep duration as mediating factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aimed to address concerns about increased screen time among children and adolescents during the pandemic and its association with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD.

Method: The study analyzed data from over 50,000 U.S. children and adolescents, utilizing natural effect models and structural equation modeling to examine relationships between screen time, physical activity, sleep patterns, and mental health outcomes.

Result: Daily screen time of 4 hours or more significantly increased the risks of anxiety, depression, behavior issues, and ADHD, with physical activity, irregular bedtime, and short sleep duration accounting for portions of these associations.

Conclusion: Excessive screen time during the pandemic is linked to poorer mental health and ADHD among children and adolescents, partly mediated by lifestyle factors. Interventions prioritizing physical activity and regular sleep routines could help mitigate these effects.

Abstract: To examine associations between screen time and anxiety, depression, behavior
or conduct problems, and ADHD among children and adolescents during the
pandemic, and to assess whether physical activity, sleep duration, and bedtime
regularity mediate these associations. Data from 50231 US children and
adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in the 2020 to 2021 National Survey of Childrens
Health were analyzed. Exact natural effect models and structural equation
modeling assessed mediation by physical activity, short sleep duration, and
irregular bedtime. We found that daily screen time equal or more than 4 hours
was linked to higher risks of anxiety (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.32, 1.58),
depression (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.41, 1.93), behavior or conduct problems (aOR =
1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.30), and ADHD (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11, 1.33). Physical
activity accounted for 30.2% to 39.3% of the association, irregular bedtime for
18.2% to 25.7%, and short sleep duration for 2.77% to 7.34%. Excessive screen
time was associated with poorer mental health and ADHD, partly explained by
reduced physical activity, irregular bedtime, and insufficient sleep.
Interventions should promote physical activity, regular sleep routines, and
adequate sleep duration to effectively mitigate mental health issues and ADHD
among children and adolescents.

### [335] [Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10064)
*Xia Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces 'Dynamical Alignment,' showing that fixed neural network structures can shift computational modes based on input dynamics, enhancing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform compared to artificial neural networks, and to suggest a new paradigm for neural computation that moves beyond static architectures.

Method: The paper explores how encoding static input into controllable dynamic trajectories enables different computational modes, revealing a bimodal optimization landscape governed by phase space dynamics.

Result: They identify two operational modes in SNNs—'dissipative' for energy efficiency and 'expansive' for computational power—that explain and overcome the performance gap with artificial neural networks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adaptive temporal dynamics, rather than fixed structure, drive computational capabilities, suggesting a shift from static architecture design to mastering dynamic computation principles in AI.

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be
determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by
establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally
different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal
dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing
paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By
encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a
bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by
phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting
dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In
contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the
representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their
artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including
classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment
between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,
offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in
neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration
dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial
systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing
toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex
static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation
principles.

### [336] [Linking GFAP Levels to Speech Anomalies in Acute Brain Injury: A Simulation Based Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10130)
*Shamaley Aravinthan,Bin Hu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This research explores the association between elevated GFAP levels and speech anomalies following brain injuries. Simulation results suggest that a fusion of biochemical markers and speech diagnostics could enhance early injury assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether GFAP, a known biomarker for brain injuries, is linked to acute speech disruptions and to evaluate the potential of combining biochemical and speech diagnostics for rapid triage.

Method: A simulated cohort of 200 virtual patients was analyzed, with GFAP kinetics modeled from published data and speech anomalies derived from lesion-specific mappings. Machine learning models were employed to assess GFAP, speech, and lesion data, while causal inference methods estimated the relationship between GFAP elevation and speech severity.

Result: GFAP levels correlated significantly with simulated speech anomaly severity, particularly in cortical lesions. Speech anomalies emerged before GFAP elevation by a median of 42 minutes for cortical injuries. A multimodal diagnostic model outperformed single-modality models, demonstrating an AUC of 0.86. Causal analysis showed GFAP elevation was linked to a 32–35% increase in moderate-to-severe speech anomalies.

Conclusion: The study suggests a promising link between GFAP levels and acute speech anomalies post-brain injury, highlighting the potential for integrated diagnostics to enhance early triage. However, the findings need clinical validation.

Abstract: Background: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a biomarker for
intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, but its link to acute
speech disruption is untested. Speech anomalies often emerge early after
injury, enabling rapid triage.
  Methods: We simulated a cohort of 200 virtual patients stratified by lesion
location, onset time, and severity. GFAP kinetics followed published
trajectories; speech anomalies were generated from lesion-specific
neurophysiological mappings. Ensemble machine-learning models used GFAP,
speech, and lesion features; robustness was tested under noise, delays, and
label dropout. Causal inference (inverse probability of treatment weighting and
targeted maximum likelihood estimation) estimated directional associations
between GFAP elevation and speech severity.
  Findings: GFAP correlated with simulated speech anomaly severity (Spearman
rho = 0.48), strongest for cortical lesions (rho = 0.55). Voice anomalies
preceded detectable GFAP rise by a median of 42 minutes in cortical injury.
Classifier area under the curve values were 0.74 (GFAP only), 0.78 (voice
only), and 0.86 for the fused multimodal model, which showed higher sensitivity
in mild or ambiguous cases. Causal estimates indicated higher GFAP increased
the modeled probability of moderate-to-severe speech anomalies by 32 to 35
percent, independent of lesion site and onset time.
  Conclusion: These results support a link between GFAP elevation and speech
anomalies in acute brain injury and suggest integrated biochemical-voice
diagnostics could improve early triage, especially for cortical injury.
Findings are simulation-based and require validation in prospective clinical
studies with synchronized GFAP assays and speech recordings.

TL;DR: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge involved predicting fMRI brain responses from 80 hours of multimodal movie stimuli, with winners determined by performance on held-out data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance computational neuroscience by pushing brain activity prediction models to handle complex multimodal stimuli.

Method: Teams used fMRI brain responses from 1,000 brain parcels collected while participants watched movies, leveraging training and validation datasets.

Result: Winning teams achieved enhanced prediction accuracy, particularly for novel held-out movies, highlighting model advancements.

Conclusion: The challenge demonstrated improved brain encoding capabilities and set the stage for future developments in predicting human brain activity.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper extends the prediction-powered inference framework to handle scenarios with varying labeling probabilities by incorporating an inverse probability weighted adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of conducting valid statistical inference when labeling probabilities in data can vary across units, which is common in partially labeled datasets.

Method: The authors replace the unweighted bias-correction term in prediction-powered inference with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) version, utilizing Horvitz–Thompson or Hájek estimators, and examine performance when inclusion probabilities are estimated from a model.

Result: IPW-adjusted PPI demonstrates strong performance in simulations, maintaining nominal coverage and variance-reduction benefits even with estimated propensities.

Conclusion: By connecting survey sampling ideas with prediction-powered inference, this approach enables valid estimators for cases with informative labeling, broadening the applicability of the framework.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

*Kennon Stewart*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper adapts machine unlearning concepts to dynamic online settings, introduces improvements to regret bounds and optimization methods for continuous data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning approaches assume impractical static training environments, ignoring the need for dynamic learning and unlearning in real-world ML pipelines.

Method: The authors apply notions of regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity to online settings, improve regret bounds to logarithmic scale, and replace computationally expensive Hessian inversions with L-BFGS optimization.

Result: The improvements enhance computational efficiency, reduce memory footprint over time, and extend model usability without frequent retraining.

Conclusion: The paper proposes strategies for efficient machine unlearning in online environments, making it viable for continuous data-driven contexts.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study provides tight finite-sample bounds for generalized first-order iterative algorithms, including gradient-based optimization and AMP methods, using a novel coupling technique with Gaussian processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the finite-sample behavior and improve existing proofs of generalized first-order iterative algorithms, especially for Gaussian matrices and non-separable nonlinearities.

Method: The authors use an explicit coupling mechanism between algorithm iterates and a Gaussian process via state evolution recursion, departing from classical AMP inductive methods.

Result: They derive dimension-independent bounds under mild conditions, introducing a unified AMP theory for Gaussian matrices, along with a complementary lower bound on Wasserstein distance to validate the sharpness.

Conclusion: The paper advances the theoretical understanding of generalized first-order algorithms and provides more effective tools for analyzing their behavior in finite-sample settings.

Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of
generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based
optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian
data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result
constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized
first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance
evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion.
This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and
moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP
proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order
method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach
provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without
relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the
Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.

### [341] [An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879)
*Johanna Düngler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents an algorithm for estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors in Differentially Private Stochastic PCA, achieving improved utility even when $n$ scales linearly with dimension $d$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Differentially Private Stochastic PCA require either super-linear scaling of sample size $n$ with dimension $d$ or introduce excessive noise, making them less practical. Previous efforts were limited to estimating the top eigenvector ($k=1$), leaving the general case unaddressed.

Method: The paper introduces a new algorithm capable of estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for any $k \leq d$. It achieves near-optimal utility guarantees for $k=1$ and provides matching upper and lower bounds for $k > 1$ up to a factor of $k$.

Result: This algorithm matches the statistical error guarantees of existing methods for $k=1$ but generalizes to arbitrary $k$. It achieves utility improvements even when the sample size $n$ scales linearly with dimension $d$. Experimental results show superior performance compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully generalizes DP-PCA for multi-dimensional subspaces ($k > 1$), maintaining privacy and achieving near-optimal error bounds. It advances Differentially Private Stochastic PCA for broader applicability and higher utility.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

*Mary Chriselda Antony Oliver,Emmanuel Hartman,Tom Needham*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance, extending its application for advanced data structures, and presenting improved computational methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of the standard Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric, such as sensitivity to outliers, restricted mass comparison, and narrow applicability to network/hypernetwork structures.

Method: The paper reformulates the CGW distance using semi-couplings, expands its application beyond metric measure spaces, and devises a block coordinate ascent algorithm for its computation.

Result: The authors established key properties of the CGW metric, including its scaling, convergence, and robustness to perturbations, and demonstrated computational efficiency via experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The paper advances the CGW distance, both theoretically and computationally, providing a robust and scalable tool for analyzing diverse and high-dimensional data structures.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare
probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an
important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as
ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as
the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to
outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW
distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned
with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by
S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in
terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure
space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures.
With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the
CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational
convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds
with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative
bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in
the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple
and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation,
and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our
approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and
structured datasets.

### [343] [Estimating Covariance for Global Minimum Variance Portfolio: A Decision-Focused Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10776)
*Juchan Kim,Inwoo Tae,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper introduces decision-focused learning (DFL) for portfolio optimization, demonstrating its superiority over traditional statistical estimators minimizing prediction error like MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional portfolio optimization methods often rely on minimizing prediction error and can lead to suboptimal investment decisions due to their inability to accurately assess the risk-return trade-off under future uncertainty.

Method: The authors utilize decision-focused learning (DFL) to derive the global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP) by optimizing decision quality directly, using theoretical gradient derivations and properties associated with the GMVP's principal components.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that DFL-based methods outperform prediction-focused methods by delivering superior decision performance and optimal portfolio allocations in practice.

Conclusion: DFL provides better portfolio optimization, reducing volatility and improving decision-driving features compared to conventional estimation methods, thus offering significant advantages for effective portfolio construction.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by
quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate
parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of
appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction.
However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning
algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a
criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we
adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes
decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive
the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its
properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may
fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods
consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its
volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation
characteristics.

TL;DR: The paper presents a cloud detection method using infrared radiances analyzed through Support Vector Machines (SVM), achieving 88.30% agreement with reference labels and demonstrating robustness for operational use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cloud detection is crucial for atmospheric studies, climate research, and weather predictions.

Method: The study applies SVMs combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and selective channel analysis for cloud detection using infrared radiances.

Result: The method achieves 88.30% alignment with reference data, shows consistency with MODIS cloud masks, but faces discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.

Conclusion: CISVM is an effective and adaptable tool for cloud classification, demonstrating operational potential and compatibility with future satellite missions like FORUM.

Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and
weather forecasting. We analyze infrared radiances from the Infrared
Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard Meteorological Operational
(MetOp) satellites to classify scenes as clear or cloudy.
  We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, based on kernel methods
for non-separable data. In this study, the method is implemented for Cloud
Identification (CISVM) to classify the test set using radiances or brightness
temperatures, with dimensionality reduction through Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most
informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement
with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest
discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.
  These results demonstrate that CISVM is a robust, flexible, and efficient
method for automated cloud classification from infrared radiances, suitable for
operational retrievals and future missions such as Far infrared Outgoing
Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), the ninth European Space Agency
Earth Explorer Mission.

TL;DR: The paper presents a graduate-level introduction to deep learning (DL) for quantum science, addressing its potential and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the transformative impact of deep learning in quantum science, exploring its potential to tackle the field's intrinsic complexity and its associated risks.

Method: The paper uses lecture notes combining conceptual explanations and hands-on examples, organized in a progressive sequence to guide the application of DL in quantum science.

Result: It equips readers with the knowledge to decide when and how to apply deep learning, considering practical constraints and limitations.

Conclusion: Deep learning is a powerful yet nuanced tool for quantum science, demanding thoughtful integration to ensure scientific rigor and effectiveness.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods
responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

### [346] [Mitigating Exponential Mixed Frequency Growth through Frequency Selection and Dimensional Separation in Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10533)
*Michael Poppel,David Bucher,Maximilian Zorn,Nico Kraus,Jonas Stein,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper addresses regression failures in quantum machine learning models due to insufficient trainable parameters despite relevant frequencies being present. It proposes frequency selection and dimensional separation techniques to improve model approximation and trainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to optimize quantum computing's potential in quantum machine learning by addressing regression failures caused by inefficient parameter management in quantum models.

Method: Two white-box experiments were conducted to demonstrate how frequency selection and dimensional separation methods mitigate double-exponential parameter growth, enabling models to focus on essential frequencies and dimensional interdependencies.

Result: The proposed techniques successfully reduced parameter requirements in quantum machine learning models, allowing fitting of complex functions that default methods failed to handle. Training on noisy quantum simulators and inference on real quantum hardware were also demonstrated.

Conclusion: Frequency selection and dimensional separation enhanced trainability in quantum machine learning by managing parameter growth efficiently, paving the way for better problem-solving on current hardware.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a native three-qubit entangling gate using engineered interactions to enable efficient single-step multi-qubit operations, emphasizing applications in quantum error correction and surface-code stabilizer measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of conventional multi-qubit operations that decompose into multiple two-qubit gates, the paper aims to optimize and amplify desired interactions for robust performance.

Method: The authors employed a hybrid optimization strategy to selectively engineer interactions, suppress unwanted couplings, and classify the gate as a cross-resonance gate capable of multiple quantum operations.

Result: The gate demonstrated robust functionality in applications like GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class logic demonstrations, and optimized controlled-ZZ operations for improved stabilizer measurements.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for integrating native three-qubit gates into superconducting quantum processors, improving circuit architectures for next-generation quantum technologies.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

*Vítor N. Lourenço,Aline Paes,and Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an explainable fact-checking framework that uses multimodal data to improve misinformation detection on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global spread of misinformation amplified by social media dynamics and the need for interpretable mechanisms in fact-checking systems.

Method: The framework combines content, social media, and graph-based features alongside a misinformation classifier equipped with explainability techniques, tested across multiple languages.

Result: Experiments show multimodal data improves performance compared to single modalities, and the framework generates trustworthy, interpretable, and robust explanations for its predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating multimodal data and explainability into fact-checking enhances the effectiveness and trustworthiness of misinformation detection systems.

Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content
trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems.
Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes"
and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond
content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling
content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation
and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that
combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance
fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability
techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting
classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information
improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on
datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's
explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates
human-understandable justifications for its predictions.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SABIA, a hybrid deep learning model combining BERT, BiLSTM, and CNN, designed to detect opioid-related behaviors on social media more accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting opioid misuse on social media, complicated by slang, informal expressions, and coded language.

Method: Developed a hybrid deep learning model (SABIA) using the integration of BERT, BiLSTM, and CNN, combined with data preprocessing, fine-tuning, and classification into 5 categories.

Result: SABIA outperformed baseline models, achieving a 9.30% improvement in accuracy. It was validated using Reddit data annotated by opioid-related behavior categories and exhibited robust, benchmark performance.

Conclusion: The study shows the effectiveness of hybrid models like SABIA in analyzing complex online behaviors to aid public health initiatives in monitoring and intervening in opioid misuse trends.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public
health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use,
and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to
the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can
obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of
opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions,
slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and
developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create
a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target
dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing
semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data
preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning
phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new
dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors
across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users,
Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines.
Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA
achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic
Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven
previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study
demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex
opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring
and intervention efforts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network model SCMS-PINN v35 to predict band structures of graphene with high accuracy while enforcing crystallographic symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting electronic band structures in 2D materials is challenging due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and physical accuracy.

Method: The SCMS-PINN v35 model uses a multi-head ResNet-6 architecture with pathways (K-head, M-head, General head) and enforces crystallographic symmetry via systematic averaging across 31 physics-informed features.

Result: The model achieves 99.99% reduction in training loss, predicts Dirac point gaps close to zero, and ensures symmetry preservation across the Brillouin zone with small average errors for valence and conduction bands.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates a highly accurate and symmetry-enforced methodology to learn graphene band structures, laying the foundation for broader applications in 2D material discovery.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional
materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to
balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the
Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN)
v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing
crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach
introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics,
M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation --
operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive
Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from
5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local
critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\%
reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085.
The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and
achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across
the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through
systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework
establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader
two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

TL;DR: The study investigates adversarial attacks on ASR models, improving attack imperceptibility, and explores low-pass filtering as a potential defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand the robustness of ASR models against adversarial attacks and address the imperceptibility of such attacks to ensure model reliability.

Method: The authors study existing adversarial attacks, relax optimization objectives for partial suppression, and propose a low-pass filter as a defense strategy.

Result: The relaxed objective increases attack imperceptibility, and the low-pass filter demonstrates potential as an effective defense.

Conclusion: Improving imperceptibility and deploying robust defenses like low-pass filters can strengthen ASR models against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks 11 deep learning models in bioacoustics tasks, emphasizing the limitations of fine-tuned and non-fine-tuned audio-pretrained models in different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of audio-pretrained deep learning models in bioacoustics tasks, particularly their embeddings' capability for clustering.

Method: The authors benchmarked 11 deep learning models on bioacoustics tasks by reducing embeddings' dimensionality and evaluating clustering performance under various fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: The study found that 1) non-fine-tuned audio-pretrained models underperformed fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) most models failed to separate background and labeled sounds except ResNet, and 3) fine-tuned models performed better with fewer background sounds during training.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of fine-tuning audio-pretrained models for bioacoustic applications and recommends verifying embeddings after fine-tuning.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network named PuttNet to reduce distortions (artifacts) created by speech enhancement models. Alternating between a speech enhancement model and PuttNet improves audio quality significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech enhancement models often produce artifacts that lower audio quality, and this paper aims to address this issue.

Method: The authors propose PuttNet, a post-processing neural network, and advocate for an alternating application of PuttNet and the speech enhancement model.

Result: Improved perceptual speech quality (PESQ), intelligibility (STOI), and noise reduction (CBAK) scores were achieved using the proposed technique.

Conclusion: Alternating between speech enhancement and PuttNet outperforms repeated use of isolated models, offering a practical approach to enhancing audio quality while minimizing distortions.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Motivation: The study aims to improve deepfake audio detection, emphasizing the need for benchmarking performance in real-world cross-domain scenarios.

Method: They developed a novel Fake Speech Wild dataset with diverse real and fake audio from multiple social media platforms, applied self-supervised learning methodologies, and tested data augmentation strategies to enhance countermeasures.

Result: Augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW dataset led to detection performance improvements, achieving a low average equal error rate of 3.54% across evaluation sets.

Conclusion: The research significantly progresses deepfake detection on social media, demonstrating the value of the FSW dataset and data augmentation for robust countermeasures.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake

from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,

*Birgit Nierula,Mustafa Tevfik Lafci,Anna Melnik,Mert Akgül,Farelle Toumaleu Siewe,Sebastian Bosse*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper investigates how personal space violations and threatening facial expressions by virtual avatars impact physiological and subjective responses during different interaction phases in VR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand phase-specific physiological responses and the influence of threatening facial expressions during personal space violations in virtual environments, due to the increasing relevance of proxemics in VR applications.

Method: The study used a 2x2 factorial design to manipulate Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression (neutral vs. angry) with 16 participants. Physiological (SCR, HRV) and subjective (discomfort) responses were recorded during approach and standing phases, with personal space boundaries individually calibrated.

Result: Participants showed higher SCR during the standing phase of personal space violations, indicating increased arousal. Angry facial expressions reduced HRV and increased discomfort ratings but did not amplify SCR responses.

Conclusion: Distinct physiological modalities capture different proxemic response aspects, with SCR reflecting spatial boundary violations and HRV responding to facial threat cues. These insights enhance understanding of social behavior in VR and the design of realistic avatar interactions.

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social
interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.
While previous research has established that users respond to personal space
violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific
physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain
understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to
personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening
facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence
these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design
manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression
(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart
rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were
individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR
responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the
approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged
proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing
than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,
reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort
ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that
different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic
responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV
responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing
comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual
environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.

Motivation: To address the communication barriers posed by domain-specific jargon during interdisciplinary workplace interactions, which are inadequately managed by existing strategies.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by

current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to

against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time

Motivation: To develop generalized neural decoding methods that do not rely on patient-specific training, enabling more effective closed-loop neuromodulation therapy.

Method: Trained a foundation model on 24 days of deep brain stimulation data with a specialized pre-training loss function addressing frequency bias.

Result: Demonstrated effective Parkinson's disease symptom decoding using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, without requiring patient-specific training.

Conclusion: Foundation models can generalize across patients for neural decoding of pathological states, potentially advancing neuromodulation therapies.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable
patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in
pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized
state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a
foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation
recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom
fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We
present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological
data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss
functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation without patient-individual training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of text prompts (low precision) and knob/slider controls (high complexity) in controlling intricate tasks, leveraging human-friendly natural language interfaces.

Method: The paper integrates an MCP2OSC server with Claude (a Large Language Model) to enable natural language generation, interpretation, and management of OSC messages. It demonstrates practical applications via 14 QA examples and establishes generalized prompt templates.

Result: The integration effectively handles various OSC development tasks like message generation, debugging, visualization, and managing address patterns, enhancing human-machine collaboration.

Conclusion: The study proposes a new paradigm for using LLMs at the protocol level, showcasing the potential for language-based universal control mechanisms for multimedia devices, improving human creativity and operational precision.

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly

TL;DR: The study identifies reproducible physiological features associated with arousal levels using systematic feature selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reliability in linking subjective emotional states to objective physiological markers, addressing the reproducibility issue in Affective Computing.

Method: Continuous arousal annotations paired with 164 features extracted from cardiac and electrodermal signals were analyzed using T-Rex, controlling the False Discovery Rate.

Result: Only two electrodermal-derived features demonstrated reproducible and significant associations with arousal, confirmed at a 100% rate.

Conclusion: Rigorous reproducibility assessments are essential in physiological feature selection for applications in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAT bond pricing models have difficulty capturing complex relational data, necessitating more advanced methods to incorporate market structure insights.

Method: The study models the CAT bond market as a graph leveraging R-GCN. It analyzed the scale-free network properties of this market and utilized topological centrality features for predicting bond spreads.

Result: CATNet showed outstanding predictive accuracy, exceeding a Random Forest benchmark. Network features like centrality metrics enhanced predictability and provided interpretable insights.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that network connectivity is critical for CAT bond pricing, demonstrating that graph-based models like CATNet yield both high accuracy and new market understandings.

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture
the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper
introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning
architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the
CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure
for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits
the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few
highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive
performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The
inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further,
significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these
network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative
proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation,
underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence
that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new
paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver
both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

Motivation: To address challenges in optimizing personalized product search rankings while integrating various data types and reducing reliance on human annotation for relevance labeling.

Method: The approach utilizes a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings, a novel sampling technique for diverse behaviors, and a scalable labeling mechanism based on click data for multi-task learning. Comparisons were made with existing models like XGBoost and FT-Transformer.

Result: The proposed model outperformed baseline approaches in terms of handling mixed data types and improving search rankings. Incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT, and embedding interactions proved beneficial.

Conclusion: The integration of non-tabular data, advanced embeddings, and multi-task techniques is highly effective for personalized product search ranking, demonstrating scalability and superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,

personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced

*Michael Weiss,Robert Rosenbach,Christian Eggenberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates optimizing e-commerce product rankings for different objectives like CTR, ACR, or OSR and finds that optimizing for OSR yields significantly higher GMV without compromising product discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether optimizing for objectives directly related to business goals (OSR) yields better results than generalist metrics like CTR in e-commerce platforms.

Method: The authors conducted an online A/B test to compare the impact of different ranking objectives, such as CTR and OSR, on metrics like GMV and product discovery.

Result: Optimizing for OSR produced a GMV uplift more than five times greater than optimizing for CTR while maintaining effective new product discovery.

Conclusion: Focusing on OSR for ranking recommendations in e-commerce aligns better with business goals and offers significant advantages over CTR optimization.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

*Ze Liu,Xianquan Wang,Shuochen Liu,Jie Ma,Huibo Xu,Yupeng Han,Zhe Yang,Kai Zhang,Longfei Li,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrossDenoise, a lightweight framework for reducing noise in recommender systems' implicit feedback, showing significant performance improvements with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems struggle with noisy implicit feedback affecting their accuracy, and existing denoising methods either lack entity-awareness, are computationally expensive, or demand complex hyperparameter tuning.

Method: CrossDenoise disentangles noise into user-, item-, and interaction-specific factors, computes reputation factors via average training losses, and incorporates interaction-level weights using an empirical CDF. It is model-agnostic, efficient, and uses only two hyperparameters.

Result: CrossDenoise significantly improves NDCG@50, with up to a 27.01% gain on Yelp using NeuMF, across multiple datasets and models, without adding significant computational or memory overhead.

Conclusion: CrossDenoise is a practical and scalable denoising solution for recommender systems, effectively separating noisy data while being robust and lightweight to implement.

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) for ROS 2 DDS communication to model reliable transmission and optimize reliability, latency, and performance in lossy wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of tuning heartbeat periods, IP fragmentation, and retransmission intervals in lossy wireless networks, which obscure end-to-end latency behavior and provide limited guidance for practitioners.

Method: A probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) analytically models ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach, analyzing middleware and transport-level events to compute the probability distribution of unacknowledged messages and retransmission latency.

Result: PLA was validated across 270 scenarios, including variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and publishing and retransmission intervals, showing close alignment between analytical predictions and experimental results.

Conclusion: The findings offer a theoretical foundation to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and performance for wireless industrial robotics.

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, addressing temporal dependencies in time series data through spike-and-slab priors and a two-stage MCMC algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving model accuracy and robustness in time series contexts with autocorrelated noise, which is highly relevant to fields like finance, hydrology, and meteorology.

Method: The paper employs hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors, combined with a two-stage MCMC algorithm, to address challenges in variable selection for high-dimensional, autoregressive time series models.

Result: The proposed framework shows superior variable selection accuracy, lower MSPE, and better true model identification under autocorrelated conditions in both simulation studies and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and practical solution for variable selection and forecasting in autoregressive time series models, enhancing both interpretability and predictive performance.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression
with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive
structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses
depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent
stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and
meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our
methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to
simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an
efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion
indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational
challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency
under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with
sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables.
Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P
500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable
selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods,
our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component
identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring
practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for tissue motion tracking in radiotherapy struggle with large misalignments and lack interpretability, limiting their clinical utility.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes DINOv2 with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers to detect landmarks for interpretable image registration, reducing trainable parameters and improving efficiency. It directly computes registration at test time without iterative optimization.

Result: DINOMotion achieves high Dice scores (92.07% for kidney, 90.90% for liver, 95.23% for lung) and low Hausdorff distances, processing scans in ~30ms while outperforming state-of-the-art methods, particularly for large misalignments.

Conclusion: DINOMotion demonstrates significant potential as a robust, interpretable, and efficient solution for real-time motion tracking in radiotherapy, promising better treatment outcomes and safety.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods with integrated transparency offer reliable, interpretable solutions for lung cancer screening, especially valuable for under-resourced healthcare environments.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence
contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate
that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,

Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment, focusing on improving surgical phase, action, and event recognition.

Method: The study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural network architectures and proposes novel frameworks like DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE. Semi-supervised learning techniques, dynamic pseudo-labeling, and large datasets (GynSurg, Cataract-1K) are employed to improve performance.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for developing robust, data-efficient, and clinically impactful AI systems for surgical video analysis, enabling advancements in surgical care and training.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the

TL;DR: The paper proposes Haar-tSVD, a computationally simple and effective image denoising algorithm based on PCA, Haar transform, and t-SVD projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ever-growing volume of image data necessitates efficient and effective denoising methods to handle nonlocal self-similarity in images while maintaining computational simplicity.

Method: Haar-tSVD combines the PCA and Haar transform under a circulant framework, uses t-SVD for unified patch correlation analysis, and incorporates an adaptive CNN noise estimation scheme.

Result: Experiments confirm Haar-tSVD is effective in noise removal and detail preservation across real-world denoising tasks.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD offers a fast, parallelizable, and robust image denoising solution, balancing performance and computational efficiency. It is publicly available for further validation and application.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIVA-VQA, a novel method for no-reference video quality assessments, excelling in both accuracy and runtime efficiency on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the increased demand for scalable methods to measure perceptual video quality in social media and streaming applications without a pristine reference.

Method: A spatio-temporal fragmentation approach leveraging inter-frame variations is used, analyzing quality-sensitive regions across frames, patches, and more. It also combines 2D and 3D features for capturing variations.

Result: Experiments on five datasets showed DIVA-VQA ranking among the top 2 in terms of rank correlation while being computationally efficient compared to other methods.

Conclusion: DIVA-VQA is demonstrated to be both effective and resource-efficient, making it suitable for large-scale video quality applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: FROGENT is a new AI framework integrating multiple tools and databases for seamless drug discovery workflows, outperforming existing models and agents in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drug discovery tools are fragmented across various platforms, leading to inefficiencies in managing workflows and using disparate technologies.

Method: FROGENT employs a Large Language Model, Model Context Protocol, biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and customized AI models to integrate and dynamically execute complex drug discovery tasks.

Result: FROGENT outperformed six advanced ReAct-style agents, tripling hit-finding performance and doubling interaction profiling results compared to baseline and other reputable models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Integrated frameworks like FROGENT greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of drug discovery processes, proving its viability through benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how Wav2Vec2 self-supervised learning models encode speaker traits in children's speech, focusing on age and gender classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores the potential of self-supervised learning models for understanding children's speaker traits, a less-explored area with high variability in speech characteristics like pitch and articulation.

Method: The authors perform a layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using PCA and datasets like PFSTAR and CMU Kids to assess their capability in extracting speaker-specific and linguistic information.

Result: Early layers of Wav2Vec2 models are better at capturing speaker-specific cues. Classification accuracy reaches up to 97.14% for age and 98.20% for gender on CMU Kids, and up to 86.05% for age and 95.00% for gender on PFSTAR.

Conclusion: Speaker traits in children's speech are organized differently across SSL model layers, and focused strategies can enhance child-aware speech interfaces.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

TL;DR: The paper presents BKP, an R package for efficient spatial modeling of binomial probabilities using the Beta Kernel Process (BKP) with closed-form inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a computationally efficient and user-friendly tool for modeling spatially varying binomial probabilities, which is a gap in current statistical and machine learning methods.

Method: The authors introduced BKP, which uses kernel-weighted likelihoods combined with conjugate beta priors for closed-form posterior inference. The method avoids intensive computational techniques like MCMC, supports different kernel functions, and extends to multinomial data through DKP.

Result: The package demonstrated interpretability, accuracy, and scalability through synthetic and real-world datasets, emphasizing its capability in statistical and machine learning tasks involving spatial models.

Conclusion: BKP is the first public R package implementing BKP-based methods, offering a foundation for practical applications and future advancements in beta modeling for spatial data.

Abstract: We present BKP, a user-friendly and extensible R package that implements the
Beta Kernel Process (BKP) -- a fully nonparametric and computationally
efficient framework for modeling spatially varying binomial probabilities. The
BKP model combines localized kernel-weighted likelihoods with conjugate beta
priors, resulting in closed-form posterior inference without requiring latent
variable augmentation or intensive MCMC sampling. The package supports binary
and aggregated binomial responses, allows flexible choices of kernel functions
and prior specification, and provides loss-based kernel hyperparameter tuning
procedures. In addition, BKP extends naturally to the Dirichlet Kernel Process
(DKP) for modeling spatially varying multinomial or compositional data. To our
knowledge, this is the first publicly available R package for implementing
BKP-based methods. We illustrate the use of BKP through several synthetic and
real-world datasets, highlighting its interpretability, accuracy, and
scalability. The package aims to facilitate practical application and future
methodological development of kernel-based beta modeling in statistics and
machine learning.

TL;DR: Bayesian optimization is being increasingly explored in bioprocess engineering but requires adaptations for experimental uncertainties. This review introduces Bayesian optimization practically and identifies challenges and opportunities for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization is becoming widely used in experimental sciences but remains underdeveloped for complex biological systems with high uncertainties. Additionally, accessibility is limited for those lacking a strong statistical background.

Method: The paper serves as a review, combining an introduction to Bayesian optimization with a discussion on its applications in bioprocess engineering and outlining key research challenges.

Result: The review identifies extensions needed for classical Bayesian optimization to make it effective for biological systems and makes the methodology more accessible to practitioners.

Conclusion: This review elucidates the potential of Bayesian optimization in bioprocess engineering and highlights both its practical applications and its open challenges, thus motivating further interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has become widely popular across various experimental
sciences due to its favorable attributes: it can handle noisy data, perform
well with relatively small datasets, and provide adaptive suggestions for
sequential experimentation. While still in its infancy, Bayesian optimization
has recently gained traction in bioprocess engineering. However,
experimentation with biological systems is highly complex and the resulting
experimental uncertainty requires specific extensions to classical Bayesian
optimization. Moreover, current literature often targets readers with a strong
statistical background, limiting its accessibility for practitioners.
  In light of these developments, this review has two aims: first, to provide
an intuitive and practical introduction to Bayesian optimization; and second,
to outline promising application areas and open algorithmic challenges, thereby
highlighting opportunities for future research in machine learning.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper extends the ACI algorithm into a new method called OnlineSCI, enabling uncertainty quantification when predictions are selectively made, with theoretical and practical validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability to make selective predictions and control error rates in supervised online learning scenarios.

Method: They propose the OnlineSCI algorithm, extending ACI to allow selective inference times, adaptive updates to point-prediction algorithms, and control over error measures like the instantaneous error rate.

Result: Theoretical results demonstrate error control guarantees (average missed coverage and IER), adaptability, and convergence to optimal solutions; experiments confirm practical utility.

Conclusion: OnlineSCI is a robust, adaptive framework for online selective tasks, showing both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness for tasks like extreme outcome prediction and classification with abstention.

Abstract: In a supervised online setting, quantifying uncertainty has been proposed in
the seminal work of \cite{gibbs2021adaptive}. For any given point-prediction
algorithm, their method (ACI) produces a conformal prediction set with an
average missed coverage getting close to a pre-specified level $\alpha$ for a
long time horizon. We introduce an extended version of this algorithm, called
OnlineSCI, allowing the user to additionally select times where such an
inference should be made. OnlineSCI encompasses several prominent online
selective tasks, such as building prediction intervals for extreme outcomes,
classification with abstention, and online testing. While OnlineSCI controls
the average missed coverage on the selected in an adversarial setting, our
theoretical results also show that it controls the instantaneous error rate
(IER) at the selected times, up to a non-asymptotical remainder term.
Importantly, our theory covers the case where OnlineSCI updates the
point-prediction algorithm at each time step, a property which we refer to as
{\it adaptive} capability. We show that the adaptive versions of OnlineSCI can
convergence to an optimal solution and provide an explicit convergence rate in
each of the aforementioned application cases, under specific mild conditions.
Finally, the favorable behavior of OnlineSCI in practice is illustrated by
numerical experiments.

*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASPEN+, a system enhancing entity resolution by enabling local merges and optimality criteria, showing improved performance on datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of ASPEN in handling scenarios that require local merges and optimal criteria for entity resolution.

Method: The paper introduces local merges through computational modeling and evaluates different optimality criteria. It uses formalization and experimental analysis for validation.

Result: ASPEN+ supports local merges and offers optimality criteria, showing enhanced accuracy and reduced runtime in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: ASPEN+ improves upon ASPEN by addressing key limitations, demonstrating its effectiveness in entity resolution tasks through experimental validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

*Wei Tian,Jieming Shi,Man Lung Yiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper addresses sparse and misaligned trajectory data issues by proposing methods TRMMA and MMA for trajectory recovery and map matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse GPS trajectory data with low sampling rates and misalignment with road networks disrupt the quality of applications relying on precise location data, necessitating solutions to enhance data quality.

Method: The paper introduces MMA to map GPS points to road segments using classification over a smaller candidate set, leveraging effective embeddings. TRMMA extends this by applying a dual-transformer encoder and decoding for efficient prediction of missing points.

Result: Experiments on four large real-world datasets demonstrate that TRMMA and MMA outperform existing methods in trajectory recovery and map matching. They consistently deliver superior results.

Conclusion: The proposed TRMMA and MMA methods significantly enhance trajectory recovery and map matching quality, providing reliable solutions for dealing with sparse and misaligned trajectory data.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new model, COMIND, to better predict neurodegeneration dynamics using structural brain connectivity while maintaining scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current connectome-informed models for neuroimaging biomarkers are limited by scalability issues and complexities arising from heterogeneous disease trajectories and excessive parameters.

Method: The authors present a hybrid model, COMIND, combining diffusion and logistic approaches with structural brain connectivity to ensure monotonic disease trajectories with fewer parameters.

Result: The model was tested on both simulated data and Parkinson's Progressive Markers Initiative (PPMI) data, demonstrating its ability to generalize to standard brain atlas imaging without reducing the number of biomarkers.

Conclusion: COMIND is a scalable, effective approach to studying neurodegenerative dynamics, making it suitable for clinical and research applications.

Abstract: Mechanistic models of progressive neurodegeneration offer great potential
utility for clinical use and novel treatment development. Toward this end,
several connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been
proposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small
number of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories
and a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the
Connectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND).
The model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural
brain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while
maintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate
our model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers
Initiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging
representations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce
biomarker number.

*Jozef Skakala*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study introduces a neural network ensemble to estimate shelf sea carbon pools using physics-biogeochemistry models, potentially reducing reliance on expensive reanalysis methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carbon pools in shelf seas are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle and their data availability is either sparse or uncertain. Reanalyses are too costly, thus prompting alternatives.

Method: An ensemble of neural networks was trained on data from a coupled physics-biogeochemistry model to predict carbon pools based on observable variables. Validation was conducted using the NWES reanalysis.

Result: The neural network ensemble successfully reproduced NWES reanalysis outputs for carbon pools and provided uncertainty estimates, unlike the existing reanalysis models.

Conclusion: Model-informed machine learning is a promising, cost-effective alternative to traditional carbon pool reanalysis methods, enhancing analysis in data-limited situations and aiding future climate scenarios.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

TL;DR: This paper develops machine learning models to predict 3D atmospheric structures of tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets, reducing reliance on computationally expensive general circulation models (GCMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of telescopes observing exoplanet atmospheres demands enhanced 3D climate modeling, but GCMs are computationally intensive, necessitating faster alternatives.

Method: The study introduces a 3D GCM grid of 60 hot Jupiters and employs dense neural networks (DNN) and decision tree algorithms (XGBoost) to predict their 3D temperature and wind structures.

Result: The ML models, especially DNN, reliably predict 3D atmospheric fields for warm-to-ultra-hot Jupiters with minor spectral deviations when compared to traditional GCMs.

Conclusion: ML tools like DNN can complement GCMs, enabling efficient exoplanet ensemble studies without significant loss of accuracy in atmospheric and spectral predictions.

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing cancer prevalence and explore alternative treatments using bioactive compounds from traditional medicinal plants.

Method: Network pharmacology analysis was utilized to identify bioactive compounds and their protein targets. Additionally, a Graph Attention Network algorithm was employed for predicting pIC50 values, complemented by molecular docking to examine interactions with cancer-related proteins.

Result: Key bioactive compounds with protein targets were identified (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, MTOR), and the Graph Attention Network achieved high predictive accuracy (R2=0.98, RMSE=0.02). Molecular docking pinpointed MTOR as a significant target for cytotoxic effects on HeLa cancer cells.

Conclusion: Bioactive xanthone compounds from Garcinia cowa demonstrate strong anti-cancer potential via targeted molecular mechanisms, with advanced computational methods providing accurate predictive insights.

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the
highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward
affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis
to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough,
indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone
compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological
activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents.
Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds
Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside
their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing
critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer
effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive
performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data
augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone

TL;DR: The paper presents an ensemble of two neural networks to classify jets from the JetNet dataset into various categories. It achieves superior results by using 2D histograms for representation and combining the strengths of the networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle to classify jets due to their complex and multidimensional structures. Advanced machine learning techniques are needed for better jet classification.

Method: The authors use an ensemble of two neural networks that classify jets by converting their data into two-dimensional histograms instead of high-dimensional points.

Result: The ensemble model effectively classifies jets into categories such as Top Quarks, Light Quarks, and W/Z bosons, exhibiting superior performance compared to individual networks.

Conclusion: The Ensemble Model shows a highly effective approach for jet classification, leveraging the strengths of neural network ensembles and demonstrating high performance in both binary and multi-class settings.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for
understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the
Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of
quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their
complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often
fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine
learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks
simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data
to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a
higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter
referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet
dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z
bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model
can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble
approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent
network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

### [386] [Memorisation and forgetting in a learning Hopfield neural network: bifurcation mechanisms, attractors and basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10765)
*Adam E. Essex,Natalia B. Janson,Rachel A. Norris,Alexander G. Balanov*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper analyzes memory formation and forgetting in Hopfield neural networks undergoing Hebbian learning, revealing bifurcation mechanisms that create attractors for true and spurious memories, while enabling a universal strategy for studying high-dimensional recurrent neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of understanding how artificial neural networks (ANNs) form memories, develop unwanted features, and experience catastrophic forgetting, due to their complex high-dimensional and non-linear nature.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of an 81-neuron Hopfield network undergoing Hebbian learning by examining bifurcation mechanisms that shape connection weights and create attractors and basin boundaries.

Result: The analysis reveals that pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations lead to the creation of new attractor basins representing true or spurious memories while also showing the abrupt disappearance of old memories, hence illustrating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that memory formation and forgetting are manifestations of the same mechanism and propose a universal analytical strategy applicable to recurrent ANNs, aiding in mitigating flaws such as catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial
neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear
how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features,
including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is
available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high
dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a
challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in
attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we
comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield
network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to
formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show
that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce
a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new
attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an
abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful
learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point
attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With
this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same
mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal
and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of
memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of
a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to
mitigate their flaws.

### [387] [A Robust Pipeline for Differentially Private Federated Learning on Imbalanced Clinical Data using SMOTETomek and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10017)
*Rodrigo Tertulino*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores Federated Learning integrated with Differential Privacy for cardiovascular risk prediction while addressing data imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and data imbalance in Federated Learning models for healthcare applications.

Method: Implemented FL framework with SMOTETomek and tuned FedProx algorithm to enhance model performance amidst imbalanced and decentralized medical data.

Result: Identified non-linear trade-off between privacy (epsilon 9.0) and utility (recall > 77%), with FedProx outperforming FedAvg.

Conclusion: A practical methodology for secure and effective diagnostic models in heterogeneous healthcare data was demonstrated.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Context Filtering model to enhance LLM safety against jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance, achieving an 88% reduction in attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancements in LLMs are accompanied by safety and ethical risks due to jailbreak attacks. There is a need for solutions that protect against these attacks while preserving the usability of LLMs.

Method: The proposed method is a Context Filtering model that pre-processes input to remove unsafe context and identify user intent without requiring fine-tuning, making it applicable across LLMs.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate a significant reduction in attack success rates by up to 88%, while the LLMs' original helpful performance remains preserved.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play Context Filtering model effectively enhances safety and minimizes ethical risks for LLMs without compromising benign user experience, offering broad applications to both white-box and black-box models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

*Yuksel Aydin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper establishes a taxonomy of seven cognitive security vulnerabilities in language models, shows the effectiveness of human-focused cognitive security training, and highlights the variability in risk across different language model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cognitive vulnerabilities in language models that parallel human cognitive security issues and to explore effective interventions.

Method: The study introduces CCS-7, a taxonomy of vulnerabilities, and evaluates a cognitive security lesson (TFVA) through a human trial and tests its guardrails across experiments on seven language model architectures.

Result: Human participants showed a +7.9% improvement in cognitive security after training, but language model response varied: some vulnerabilities were mitigated while others backfired with error rates increasing by up to 135%, depending on the model.

Conclusion: Cognitive safety interventions need to be tailored to specific model architectures, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution; this calls for refined, architecture-aware testing before deployment.

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework, ERDALT, for robust malware detection using a novel model architecture and decomposition approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware detection accuracy using machine learning is hindered by adversarial examples that can evade detection without altering the malware’s functionality.

Method: A novel model architecture and decomposition-based structure are introduced to develop both certifiably and empirically robust malware detectors. The ERDALT framework implements this approach.

Result: The proposed framework enables robust malware detection with minimal performance trade-offs and is validated against existing machine learning-based methods.

Conclusion: ERDALT allows scalable and robust malware detection, showcasing an effective defense against adversarial evasion in static analysis.

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CEMA, a multi-task text adversarial attack method capable of handling black-box scenarios with limited queries and multiple tasks. It exploits text transferability across tasks, enabling attacks on APIs, LLMs, and image-generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task adversarial text attacks struggle in practical scenarios due to reliance on internal model features, extensive queries, and single task focus.

Method: CEMA utilizes a deep-level substitute model in a plug-and-play manner, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and generating adversarial text candidates for substitute models.

Result: CEMA achieves high attack success rates across multi-task models (including classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image tasks) with as few as 100 queries, effectively targeting commercial APIs and advanced models.

Conclusion: The study confirms CEMA's adaptability and robustness in varied real-world applications, addressing limitations of current adversarial methods.

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a blockchain-enabled framework for detecting data poisoning in federated learning, decentralizing the global server role and utilizing a consensus-based judge model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability in federated learning models against data poisoning attacks and the lack of standardized, trustworthy detection methods.

Method: The proposed system uses blockchain technology to decentralize the server role across clients and introduces a consensus-based judge model for detecting poisoned data in model updates.

Result: The implementation demonstrated robustness against data poisoning attacks and scalability in creating the judge model.

Conclusion: The study verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the blockchain-enabled framework in improving the integrity and performance of federated learning systems.

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

TL;DR: The study addresses security threats in combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, demonstrating vulnerabilities and proposing a defense-in-depth approach using the MAESTRO framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and mitigate security vulnerabilities in autonomous agent systems integrating LLMs, which are increasingly used in network monitoring and decision-making systems.

Method: The authors used the MAESTRO framework with a seven-layer threat modeling architecture to analyze and mitigate vulnerabilities. A prototype system was built using Python, LangChain, and WebSockets, including modules for inference, memory, parameter tuning, and anomaly detection.

Result: Two key threats were demonstrated: resource denial of service from traffic replay and memory poisoning through log tampering. These led to measurable performance degradation, including delayed telemetry updates and increased computational loads.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of the MAESTRO framework for threat mapping and suggests using a multilayered defense-in-depth approach focusing on memory integrity, adaptation logic monitoring, and secure cross-layer communication to ensure AI agent reliability in adversarial settings.

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

TL;DR: This paper presents a security framework for energy management systems (EMSs) that tackles vulnerabilities using a novel multi-point attack model and generative AI-based anomaly detection systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cybersecurity vulnerabilities and system problems in energy management systems, acknowledging interconnected attack vectors.

Method: Propose a multi-point attack model, employ generative AI-based anomaly detection, and integrate visual markers with rules in a SoM-GI framework.

Result: Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system demonstrated effectiveness across scenarios, with visual analysis enhancing anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Combining numerical analysis with visual and linguistic methods enhances EMS security against cyber threats and system errors.

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network security requires scalable, efficient methods to detect and respond to threats under resource constraints.

Method: The framework employs a two-tier design: autonomous micro-agents for local traffic analysis and a central controller for system-wide situational awareness.

Result: Testing on a micro-testbed and simulations showed scalability under resource constraints, reduced redundancy, faster response time, and maintained accuracy.

Conclusion: NetMoniAI effectively integrates decentralized and centralized mechanisms for network security, and its open-source release supports wider adoption and innovation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic
network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with
lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers:
autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the
complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and
practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network

*Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a search-based framework using LLMs to simulate and analyze attack and defense strategies in privacy-critical interactions, highlighting the escalating sophistication of tactics and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing deployment of LLM-based agents poses privacy risks due to malicious multi-turn interactions designed to extract sensitive information, demanding sophisticated approaches to safeguard privacy.

Method: The authors use a simulation framework involving three roles (data subject, data sender, and data recipient) and optimize interactions through LLM-driven parallel search algorithms to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses.

Result: Their research reveals how attack strategies evolve from direct requests to complex tactics like impersonation, while defenses improve from simple rules to robust identity-verification mechanisms, demonstrating practical applicability across diverse models.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for advanced mechanisms to detect and counter sophisticated privacy threats, while showing that the framework's methodology provides effective tools for designing privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework for detecting and classifying False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids using residential energy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Home Area Networks (HANs) in smart grids to False Data Injection Attacks, which manipulate energy usage data and compromise grid operations.

Method: The study uses a lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for real-time attack detection and a Bidirectional LSTM for classifying attack types. A synthetic time-series dataset is utilized for model training and testing.

Result: The proposed ANN and Bidirectional LSTM models effectively identify and classify FDIAs, demonstrating scalability and utility in enhancing grid security.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, data-driven defense mechanism to bolster cybersecurity in smart grids, particularly through protecting residential endpoints from data manipulation attacks.

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

*Yuhao Sun,Yihua Zhang,Gaowen Liu,Hongtao Xie,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Water4MU, a watermarking-based framework to improve machine unlearning (MU) by embedding data-level adjustments for precise and effective data removal from ML models, while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing need for machine unlearning (MU) to remove the influence of sensitive data from machine learning models to enhance trust and regulatory compliance. Current MU methods focus primarily on adjusting model weights, neglecting potential benefits of data-level modifications.

Method: The authors propose Water4MU, a framework leveraging digital watermarking for MU. The approach uses a bi-level optimization (BLO) framework to strategically modify data and minimize unlearning difficulty. The upper level optimizes the watermarking network for MU effectiveness, while the lower level independently trains the model.

Result: Experiments reveal that Water4MU successfully enhances the unlearning process across image classification and image generation tasks. It performs particularly well in challenging unlearning scenarios, where current methods struggle.

Conclusion: Water4MU demonstrates that integrating digital watermarking with a BLO framework is a promising strategy to address challenging machine unlearning tasks, offering both precision in data removal and preservation of model utility.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate and improve incident response (IR) by dynamically retrieving and utilizing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security teams face challenges such as alert fatigue, high false-positive rates, and the overwhelming volume of fragmented CTI documents. Efficient integration of CTI can significantly improve security operations.

Method: The framework employs a hybrid retrieval mechanism combining NLP-based searches in a CTI vector database and external CTI platforms. It integrates this enriched intelligence into an LLM-powered response generator, systematically evaluated through both automated tools and expert validation.

Result: Empirical validation demonstrates improved accuracy, enriched contextual details, and enhanced efficiency in incident response tasks. It reduces analyst workloads and response delays.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of LLM-driven CTI integration in advancing automation within security operations. It offers a foundation for more intelligent and adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

### [400] [Legal Zero-Days: A Novel Risk Vector for Advanced AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10050)
*Greg Sadler,Nathan Sherburn*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Legal Zero-Days refer to overlooked vulnerabilities in legal systems that AI systems may exploit, causing societal disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore unexamined risks posed by advanced AI systems exploiting legal framework vulnerabilities.

Method: Developed a risk model, analyzed a case study, and created legal puzzles to evaluate AI capabilities in identifying such vulnerabilities.

Result: Current AI models are not adept at identifying impactful Legal Zero-Days, but future systems may pose both risks and opportunities.

Conclusion: Emerging AI capabilities necessitate addressing overlooked risks in legal systems to ensure societal resilience

Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Legal Zero-Days" as a novel risk vector for
advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered
vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate
and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other
processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating
these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or
impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual
citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal
oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a
methodology for creating "legal puzzles" as evaluation instruments for
assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our
findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful
Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both
risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes
to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks
from frontier AI systems.

### [401] [Advancing Data Equity: Practitioner Responsibility and Accountability in NLP Data Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10071)
*Jay L. Cunningham,Kevin Zhongyang Shao,Rock Yuren Pang,Nathaniel Mengist*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how NLP practitioners perceive issues of data equity, using practitioner insights to propose governance reforms for fair and accountable NLP practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how NLP practitioners approach fairness, equity, and governance constraints in their work, addressing gaps in the focus on both technical and community perspectives.

Method: The researchers conducted a 2024 questionnaire and focus group with U.S.-based NLP practitioners to examine their views on fairness and governance constraints.

Result: Practitioners reported tensions between commercial goals and equity, calls for participatory workflows, and concerns about diversity-washing, emphasizing the need for effective structural governance.

Conclusion: Structural governance reforms are needed to enhance NLP equity, emphasizing stronger support for practitioner agency and community consent in data workflows.

Abstract: While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to
ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners -
those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment -
perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first
to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a
multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory
recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing
on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data
practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic
constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of
Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and
equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data
workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity
washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance
reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

### [402] [Performance of universal machine-learned potentials with explicit long-range interactions in biomolecular simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10841)
*Viktor Zaverkin,Matheus Ferraz,Francesco Alesiani,Mathias Niepert*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper assesses the effectiveness of universal machine-learned potentials applied to biomolecular simulations using systematic evaluations of model architectures, training dataset compositions, and long-range dispersion treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by the underexplored application of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations and the need to assess their ability to transfer accuracy across compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom.

Method: The authors used equivariant message-passing architectures and tested these models across benchmark datasets and molecular simulations, analyzing the impact of model sizes, data composition, and electrostatics.

Result: Larger models improved benchmark accuracy but not simulation property consistency. Training dataset composition influenced predictions, while long-range electrostatics only had situational benefits like increased variability for the Trp-cage protein.

Conclusion: Current challenges like imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices limit the application of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations despite their theoretical promise.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve filtering approaches by employing advanced mathematical techniques and neural networks for efficient offline training and real-time application.

Method: This involves a novel filter using backward stochastic differential equations, nonlinear Feynman-Kac representation, and neural networks. It is trained offline through the deep BSDE method.

Result: An error bound is established under an elliptic condition, and numerical examples confirm the theoretical convergence rate of the method.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines advanced mathematical models and neural networks, providing a theoretically validated and practically efficient filtering methodology.

Abstract: A novel approximate Bayesian filter based on backward stochastic differential
equations is introduced. It uses a nonlinear Feynman--Kac representation of the
filtering problem and the approximation of an unnormalized filtering density
using the well-known deep BSDE method and neural networks. The method is
trained offline, which means that it can be applied online with new
observations. A mixed a priori-a posteriori error bound is proved under an
elliptic condition. The theoretical convergence rate is confirmed in two
numerical examples.

Motivation: To address the problem of finding lower bounds on the minimal batch regret in universal prediction, especially with access to batches of training data.

Method: The authors derive a conditional version of the regret-capacity theorem and generalize it to Rènyi information measures, connecting conditional Rènyi divergence with Sibson's mutual information.

Result: The derived theorem provides lower bounds for minimal batch regret, demonstrated through application to binary memoryless sources, and insights between conditional Rènyi divergence and Sibson's mutual information.

Conclusion: The paper establishes deeper theoretical connections in information theory and provides practical tools for universal prediction involving batch data processing.

Abstract: We derive a conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem.
This result can be used in universal prediction to find lower bounds on the
minimal batch regret, which is a recently introduced generalization of the
average regret, when batches of training data are available to the predictor.
As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources.
Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a
deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional

*Andrea Urgolo,Monika Stipsitz,Helios Sanchis-Alepuz*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores using machine learning-based virtual sensing to estimate the degradation of IGBT modules and reconstruct temperature maps with minimal sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure the reliability of power electronic systems by addressing challenges in monitoring internal degradation indicators of IGBT modules under inaccessible or harsh environments.

Method: The paper used synthetic data to train a machine learning model for estimating degraded solder areas and generating full temperature maps based on limited physical sensor inputs.

Result: The approach achieved a mean absolute error of 1.17% in estimating solder layer degradation and a maximum relative error of 4.56% in reconstructing temperature maps.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of machine learning-based virtual sensing to effectively monitor IGBT module degradation and enhance system reliability through accurate predictions.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

*Haoran Sun,Daoqi Liu,Hongyu Zhou,Maokun Li,Shenheng Xu,Fan Yang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces "DeepCSI," a physics-informed deep learning approach for solving nonlinear inverse scattering problems in mediums, providing faster and more accurate results than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in solving nonlinear inverse scattering problems, which are computationally expensive and complex due to diverse measurement scenarios in applications like electromagnetic imaging and medical diagnostics.

Method: The proposed DeepCSI employs a residual multilayer perceptron (ResMLP) to model current distributions and linearize the problem. Medium parameters are treated as learnable tensors within a fully differentiable framework that uses a hybrid loss function to jointly optimize network parameters and medium properties.

Result: Simulations and experiments demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high precision and robust reconstruction under various conditions, including full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency scenarios, outperforming traditional Contrast Source Inversion (CSI) methods.

Conclusion: DeepCSI provides a versatile, efficient, and accurate solution for complex inverse scattering problems, simplifying traditional approaches while enhancing performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with
conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and
universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including
phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under
full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming
traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for
complex inverse scattering problems.
