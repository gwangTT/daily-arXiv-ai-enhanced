To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an\nindustrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation\nmaintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized\ntool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying\nspecific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these\ndeficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement\nefforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized\nprompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent\nsolutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant\ngap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and\ncoding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,\nwe leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding\nmodels and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental\nexploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in\nassessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this\nevaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and\ndevelopment:https://github.com/CamBenchmark/cambenchmark", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces an industrial-grade benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored for civil aviation maintenance, addressing domain-specific deficiencies and enabling targeted improvements.", "motivation": "The authors sought to address the absence of specialized evaluation methods for LLMs in the critical domain of civil aviation maintenance, focusing on tasks requiring advanced reasoning and domain knowledge.", "method": "The paper develops a domain-specific benchmark to evaluate LLM capabilities in civil aviation maintenance, uses it to identify gaps in knowledge, and assesses existing vector embedding models and LLMs through experimental exploration.", "result": "The benchmark effectively highlights specific limitations in the performance of LLMs and vector embedding models in civil aviation scenarios, demonstrating its utility as an evaluation tool.", "conclusion": "The study successfully establishes and validates a robust framework for evaluating LLMs in the civil aviation maintenance domain, providing researchers and practitioners with open-source tools to drive further improvements in the field."}}

Companies\nsuch as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly\nwithin SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,\nopen-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor\nperformance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source\nsystems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to\nexpose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked\nLLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,\noptimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning.

These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is\nthe key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores integration of large language models (LLMs) into relational database management systems for enhancing SQL queries but identifies limitations in current implementations regarding output structure, resource optimization, and query planning.", "motivation": "To address the challenges and limitations of SQL-invoked LLM integrations found in both open-source and enterprise-level systems.", "method": "The authors analyzed two open-source systems and one enterprise platform using five representative SQL queries to identify functional, performance, and scalability limitations.", "result": "Three key issues were found: lack of structured output enforcement, suboptimal resource utilization, and inadequate query planning.

For the\nCognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate\nwhether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying\non other heuristics.
