### [1] [CALM: Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14936)
*Maxwell J. Jacobson,Corey J. Maley,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM introduces an integration of symbolic reasoning and neural generation for multi-modal data, outperforming traditional methods in reasoning and decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional logic systems lack nuance and robustness in real-world scenarios, while neural networks, despite their richness, lack interpretability. CALM addresses this gap by combining both systems.

Method: CALM uses a domain tree to iteratively refine predicate truth values. Neural networks process multi-modal data, and symbolic modules filter results to ensure constraints.

Result: CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy in object-placement tasks, surpassing classical logic and LLM methods.

Conclusion: CALM demonstrates efficient reasoning over multi-modal inputs, marking progress toward integrated AI systems that balance precision and contextual processing.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM). CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural networks.

### [2] [MEAL: A Benchmark for Continual Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14990)
*Tristan Tomilin,Luka van den Boogaard,Samuel Garcin,Bram Grooten,Meng Fang,Mykola Pechenizkiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEAL, a benchmark for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), introduces GPU acceleration using JAX to enable efficient learning across 100 task sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of exploratory benchmarks combining continual learning and cooperative multi-agent settings, hindering scalability and computational efficiency in RL research.

Method: MEAL employs JAX for GPU-based computation, addressing bottlenecks in CPU-based CL benchmarks. It evaluates combinations of CL and MARL methods and performs ablation studies to identify key design features.

Result: Naive integration of CL and MARL methods works for simple environments but fails in complex scenarios. MEAL demonstrated the importance of specific architecture and algorithmic components for scaling CMARL.

Conclusion: MEAL is an essential new benchmark for CMARL, highlighting the need for sustained coordination and adaptation in complex multi-agent environments.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation. Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical for CMARL on MEAL.

*Tiantian Fan,Lingjun Liu,Yu Yue,Jiaze Chen,Chengyi Wang,Qiying Yu,Chi Zhang,Zhiqi Lin,Ruofei Zhu,Yufeng Yuan,Xiaochen Zuo,Bole Ma,Mofan Zhang,Gaohong Liu,Ru Zhang,Haotian Zhou,Cong Xie,Ruidong Zhu,Zhi Zhang,Xin Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Lin Yan,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO, improving training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by leveraging incomplete responses and independent policy/value optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to enhance reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models during training by addressing inefficiencies in existing reinforcement learning approaches like PPO, especially when generating long responses.

Method: The paper proposes Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), incorporating Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) to utilize incomplete responses and introducing a mechanism to independently optimize policy and value models, streamlining computations.

Result: Experimental results on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model demonstrate that T-PPO accelerates training efficiency by up to 2.5x while outperforming existing competitors in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: T-PPO effectively improves the training efficiency and performance of reasoning LLMs by reducing redundant computations, utilizing truncated responses, and introducing an optimized learning framework, demonstrating competitive advantages in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and outperforms its existing competitors.

### [4] [HeurAgenix: Leveraging LLMs for Solving Complex Combinatorial Optimization Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15196)
*Xianliang Yang,Ling Zhang,Haolong Qian,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HeurAgenix is a large language model (LLM)-powered hyper-heuristic framework that evolves and selects heuristics to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional heuristic algorithms require manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse CO problem instances.

Method: HeurAgenix operates in two stages: heuristic evolution, where reusable strategies are extracted using LLMs; and heuristic selection, where the most promising strategies are dynamically chosen using an LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model.

Result: The framework outperformed existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics and matched/exceeded specialized solvers in canonical benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix represents a significant advancement in overcoming limitations of traditional heuristic designs, offering improved performance while reducing manual input reliance.

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce \textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

### [5] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207)
*Mohamad A. Hady,Siyi Hu,Mahardhika Pratama,Jimmy Cao,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for autonomous coordination in multi-satellite Earth Observation (EO) missions and evaluates various MARL algorithms to improve mission planning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-time decision-making, energy and data constraints, and decentralised coordination in dynamic EO missions, which current optimisation methods cannot handle effectively.

Method: RL and MARL frameworks were employed to model single and multi-satellite operations. The performance and stability of MARL algorithms, such as PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO, were assessed through simulations in a near-realistic satellite environment.

Result: The study shows that MARL methods can efficiently balance imaging and resource management in multi-satellite EO scenarios, despite challenges like non-stationarity and reward interdependence.

Conclusion: MARL has significant potential to enhance autonomous satellite operations in EO missions, providing insights and guidelines for improving decentralised mission planning.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.

### [6] [Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15225)
*Jiahao You,Ziye Jia,Chao Dong,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a cooperative MEC framework leveraging UAVs, vessels, and MIoT devices for computation offloading and resource allocation under uncertain maritime tasks, utilizing techniques like Lyapunov optimization and a Markov game approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid increase in maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) demands creates significant computational challenges, especially with uncertain task arrivals and varying resource availability. Existing methods face inefficiencies in computation offloading and resource allocation in such scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a cooperative multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework, leveraging UAVs and vessels to handle uncertain MIoT tasks. They use Lyapunov optimization to manage long-term uncertainties by converting them into short-term constraints. They further reformulate the problem into a Markov game and develop a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic algorithm for optimization.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that the proposed cooperative MEC framework is effective in computation offloading and resource allocation for uncertain MIoT tasks, reducing total execution time and optimizing resource usage.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a cooperative MEC framework, integrating UAVs, vessels, and advanced optimization methods, can effectively tackle computation and resource allocation challenges in dynamic maritime environments.

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements. However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. 
By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. 
Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation.

### [7] [Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377)
*Ruoyu Wang,Xinshu Li,Chen Wang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a causal framework for improving Visual Navigation tasks and proposes a method called Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which enhances agent performance by leveraging causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigation tasks require modeling sequential data, but existing methods fail to account for the internal association structure of historical data, possibly hindering performance improvements.

Method: The paper proposes CAN, a method embedding a Causal Understanding Module that enhances comprehension of environments through causality.

Result: CAN outperforms baseline methods in various tasks and environments with consistent gains, reinforced by extensive ablation studies validating its generalization.

Conclusion: The causal approach of CAN improves navigation performance effectively across Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without added computational demand.

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Large Language Model-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist Failure Analysis (FA) engineers by automating and enhancing workflows in FA labs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of orchestrating numerous AI components into unified workflows that align with FA processes, aiming to improve operational efficiency.

Method: The paper designs and implements the LPA, which combines LLMs with planning capabilities and external tool use to autonomously process complex queries, fetch relevant data, and generate readable outputs.

Result: Evaluation shows the LPA is effective and reliable in supporting FA tasks, such as data retrieval, automation, and report generation.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with planning tools presents a viable solution to the challenges in FA workflows, offering significant assistance and operational improvement for FA engineers.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

### [9] [The Effect of State Representation on LLM Agent Behavior in Dynamic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15624)
*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for systematically constructing natural language state representations to better design Large Language Model (LLM) agents in repeated multi-agent games, finding that specific summarizations and information types align closer with game-theoretic predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the ad hoc nature of encoding game history in multi-agent games with LLMs, which limits understanding the impact of state representation on agent behavior and the comparability of studies.

Method: The authors propose a framework that categorizes state representations based on action informativeness, reward informativeness, and prompting style, which they evaluate in a selfish routing game.

Result: Using the framework, they find that summarizing history, including regret-based information, and providing limited insight into others' actions leads to LLM agents' behaviors aligning more closely with equilibrium predictions and stable gameplay.

Conclusion: Careful design of natural language state representations can significantly influence the behavior of LLM agents in games. Optimal representations focus on summarization, regret information, and limited action exposure, achieving stability and theoretical alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.

### [10] [The AI Policy Module: Developing Computer Science Student Competency in AI Ethics and Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15639)
*James Weichert,Daniel Dunlap,Mohammed Farghally,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper focuses on incorporating AI policy discussions into computer science curricula to better prepare students for ethical and regulatory challenges in AI. It reports positive attitude changes and educational outcomes from a pilot module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in current computing curricula which fails to adequately prepare AI practitioners in translating abstract ethical principles and policy into actionable design and development practices.

Method: The researchers developed an AI Policy Module, piloted it, and conducted pre- and post-module surveys to evaluate changes in student attitudes. An assignment on "AI regulation" was included to deepen understanding.

Result: Students showed increased concern about ethical issues in AI and improved confidence in discussing AI regulation after the module.

Conclusion: Integrating discussions on AI policy through assignments and modules enhances students' understanding of ethical impacts and their preparedness to handle policy-related challenges in AI development.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys. Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing ethical challenges.

### [11] [Exploring and Exploiting the Inherent Efficiency within Large Reasoning Models for Self-Guided Efficiency Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15647)
*Weixiang Zhao,Jiahe Guo,Yang Deng,Xingyu Sui,Yulin Hu,Yanyan Zhao,Wanxiang Che,Bing Qin,Tat-Seng Chua,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in large reasoning models (LRMs) due to overthinking, proposing methods to make reasoning more concise without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency in LRMs due to overthinking impacts computational efficiency and increases inference costs, requiring solutions to optimize these systems.

Method: The paper introduces 'Efficiency Steering,' a training-free activation steering technique, and 'Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL,' a reinforcement learning method to balance brevity and accuracy.

Result: The proposed methods were tested across seven LRMs on mathematical reasoning tasks, demonstrating reduced reasoning length while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning efficiency can be significantly enhanced by leveraging intrinsic capabilities in LRMs through self-guided optimization methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work, we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency, revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning. Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automating agentic system generation capable of creating and optimizing from-scratch agents through language-driven exploration. Evaluations on exploratory and real-world tasks showed superior performance compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing frameworks, such as lack of full autonomy, constrained adaptation, and scalability in agentic systems.

Method: SwarmAgentic constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration using language-driven exploration. It employs a population-based search inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Result: SwarmAgentic outperformed all baselines across six real-world tasks, achieving a +261.8% improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark. This demonstrates its ability to handle structurally unconstrained tasks effectively.

Conclusion: The framework showcases the potential to scale autonomous multi-agent system generation by combining swarm intelligence and full automation. It represents a major advancement in agentic system design.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation.

*Yining Hong,Rui Sun,Bingxuan Li,Xingcheng Yao,Maxine Wu,Alexander Chien,Da Yin,Ying Nian Wu,Zhecan James Wang,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of Embodied Web Agents, which integrate physical embodiment with web-scale reasoning for tasks requiring blended physical and digital intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are traditionally siloed into either physical interaction or digital knowledge reasoning, limiting their capability to tackle integrated physical-digital tasks. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose a unified simulation platform merging realistic 3D environments and functional web interfaces, and introduce the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark to test cross-domain intelligence.

Result: Experimental results highlight significant performance gaps between AI systems and humans across tasks like navigation, cooking, and geolocation, pointing out both challenges and potential improvements.

Conclusion: The work establishes Embodied Web Agents as a novel and critical paradigm, emphasizing the need for integrated systems to advance capabilities across physical and digital domains.

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and web-scale knowledge access.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8 trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses integration and reliability challenges, enabling enhanced performance and compatibility for large-scale adoption in end-to-end AI systems, including further advancements in computing architectures.

Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is becoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks on hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there has been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures aimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle the massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal CIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory (eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several integration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption into end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and eNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize end-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still more efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of reliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to computation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC, fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source programming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability are enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration, allowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to reach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our proof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor technologies for enhanced computing performance.

*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a manually annotated corpus tailored for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from elderly patient discharge summaries, emphasizing rare events and nuanced clinical language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting the limited representation of the elderly population in clinical NLP datasets, the paper aims to create a resource for extracting clinically significant AEs using reliable methods.

Method: A dataset of annotated discharge summaries was developed with support for discontinuous and overlapping entities, evaluated across different annotation granularities using models like FlairNLP and transformer-based tools.

Result: Transformer models achieved high-level coarse-grained accuracy (F1 = 0.943) but struggled with fine-grained tasks (F1 = 0.675), especially for rare events and complex attributes.

Conclusion: The dataset bridges an important gap in clinical NLP, but challenges persist in capturing nuanced language. It serves as a benchmark for refining AE extraction and enabling future generalizations.

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE) extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [22] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD)', a method that combines constrained and unconstrained decoding phases to enhance structured NLP task performance, addressing shortcomings from solely constrained decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in structured NLP where constrained decoding during inference leads to lower-quality outputs.

Method: BoostCD uses a two-phase approach: (1) generating weak predictions with constrained and unconstrained decoding, and (2) combining these predictions via a boosted model for a final output.

Result: Demonstrated superiority of BoostCD on closed information extraction tasks, showing better performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: BoostCD successfully mitigates the limitations of constrained decoding by leveraging complementary errors from constrained and unconstrained predictions, improving the accuracy of structured NLP tasks.

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrEst, a framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during large language models (LLMs) inference without manual annotations, leading to improved task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods integrating contextual information into LLMs often overlook the importance of document credibility, risking the spread of unreliable information.

Method: CrEst estimates document credibility using weak supervision based on inter-document semantic coherence, offering both black-box and white-box integration strategies for LLMs.

Result: CrEst outperforms baselines on three model architectures and five datasets, improving accuracy by up to 26.86% and F1 scores by 3.49%, even under high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: Incorporating credibility assessment enhances LLM inference, with CrEst providing an effective, scalable, and robust solution for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes MDBench, a novel dataset for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in multi-document reasoning tasks, created via a synthetic generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for new benchmarks to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, specifically in the challenging and underexplored area of multi-document reasoning.

Method: The authors developed MDBench using a synthetic generation technique that starts with condensed structured knowledge, applies LLM-assisted edits to introduce multi-document reasoning challenges, and converts it into a natural text format to produce QA examples.

Result: Analysis shows that popular LLMs struggle significantly with MDBench, even on moderately short document sets. The dataset enables targeted MD-specific reasoning analysis and can be quickly adapted for evolving challenges.

Conclusion: MDBench is a valuable tool for evaluating and understanding LLM capabilities in multi-document reasoning and can adapt to future improvements in NLP modeling.

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetes prediction is an important healthcare task traditionally tackled using ML and DL techniques, but the application of LLMs for structured numerical data remains underexplored, motivating their assessment in this domain.

Method: The paper evaluates six LLMs—four open-source and two proprietary—using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods on the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are analyzed, alongside comparison with traditional ML models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B) outperformed open-source LLMs and some traditional ML models, especially in few-shot settings, achieving high accuracy and F1-scores.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for medical prediction tasks, though challenges like performance variability and the need for fine-tuning persist. The study advocates further research into prompt engineering and hybrid approaches for improved healthcare applications.

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score. However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

Motivation: To explore the possibility of reversible sentence embeddings that could enable exact text reconstruction by LLMs.

Method: The approach uses a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence, allowing LLMs to flawlessly reconstruct the sequence when prompted.

Result: Experiments showed successful reconstruction of sequences up to 240 tokens in English and Spanish datasets across various LLMs, including the Llama 3.1 8B model achieving flawless reconstruction.

Conclusion: The study reveals an intriguing capability of LLMs, opening prospects for applications such as memory-based retrieval, text compression, and controlled text generation.

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

TL;DR: The study utilizes natural language processing to detect social isolation and loneliness in suicide narratives, identifying chronic social isolation in particular demographics and events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured variables for social isolation and loneliness in the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and improve understanding and prevention of their contributions to suicide.

Method: The study used natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including topic modeling for lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, to analyze law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives over 300,000 suicide cases from 2002 to 2020.

Result: High-quality classifiers (average F1 score: .86, accuracy: .82) were developed. Chronic social isolation was identified in 1,198 cases, with higher odds observed among men, gay individuals, and divorced people. Predictive social isolation factors included events like divorce, child custody loss, eviction, and breakups.

Conclusion: These NLP methods provide effective tools for identifying and understanding social isolation, enabling better surveillance and potentially informing preventative measures for suicide in the United States.

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over 300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR = 3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001). We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up. Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and loneliness in the United States.

Motivation: The challenge in evaluating long-form text generation lies in capturing nuanced aspects like coherence, style, and relevance, as current metrics are insufficient and biased by pretraining data.

Method: The authors developed PrefBERT, a scoring model trained on datasets with Likert-rated quality to provide semantic reward feedback and guide GRPO training with differentiated rewards.

Result: PrefBERT outperforms traditional metrics in evaluations involving large language models, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, and aids in training models that generate outputs better aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: PrefBERT proves reliable for evaluating varied long passages, successfully training models that yield more human-preferred outputs than traditional metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding affect the post-hoc unlearning effectiveness in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a rising need for LLMs to effectively unlearn specific pieces of knowledge after training, due to legal, ethical, and practical concerns like privacy regulations and outdated information.

Method: The study involves empirical experiments to examine the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge under varying learning-time conditions such as using paraphrased descriptions.

Result: Two key findings: (1) Learning with paraphrased descriptions enhances unlearning performance, and (2) Unlearning individual knowledge pieces from larger text chunks is difficult.

Conclusion: The encoding of knowledge during training is crucial for enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning of information in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world, the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc, has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2) unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging. Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) and Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to address ambiguities in dialogue discourse parsing and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in dialogues caused by linguistic features like omission and idiom challenge existing discourse parsers.

Method: Develop DCM with clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning, along with CPO to optimize clarifications and prevent cascading errors.

Result: Experiments on STAC and Molweni datasets show the approach resolves ambiguities and achieves higher performance compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology significantly improves dialogue discourse parsing by addressing ambiguities and optimizing clarifications.

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the CKD-EHR framework for disease risk prediction using EHRs, leveraging knowledge distillation from a large language model to a lightweight model, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve disease risk prediction models by addressing the limitations of existing large language models: insufficient medical knowledge representation and low deployment efficiency.

Method: The CKD-EHR framework involves fine-tuning a large language model (Qwen2.5-7B) with enhanced medical data, generating interpretable soft labels using a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism, and transferring the distilled knowledge to a lightweight BERT student model.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the MIMIC-III dataset shows a 9% improvement in diagnostic accuracy, a 27% improvement in F1-score, and a 22.2 times increase in inference speed compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: CKD-EHR provides an effective technical solution to optimize resource utilization by improving prediction accuracy and efficiency in clinical settings.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

### [32] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the one-to-many (o2m) nature of Open-domain Dialogue (OD) by introducing a two-step framework: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most dialogue models ignore the inherent one-to-many property of OD, which limits response diversity and quality.

Method: The researchers proposed o2mDial, a dataset with multiple responses per dialogue context, and developed strategies combining in-context learning and instruction-tuning. They also designed new evaluation metrics for MRG and a model-based PS approach.

Result: The two-stage approach significantly boosted response diversity and coherence, enhancing the quality of responses by up to 90%, particularly in smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating the o2m property into OD models via the proposed framework improves response performance, making smaller models nearly comparable to larger ones.

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a Korean tokenizer, reducing token count by 10% without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a tokenizer that decreases token fertility in Korean text while maintaining model efficiency and performance.

Method: The method involves pre-tokenization based on Korean linguistics, a seed vocabulary for linguistic units, and a branching entropy-based selection algorithm.

Result: Thunder-Tok reduces token count and improves inference speed by 10% compared to BPE, with no drop in performance.

Conclusion: A linguistically informed tokenizer like Thunder-Tok can enhance processing efficiency for Korean language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes memory in state-space language models, focusing on how information retention and forgetting manifest through primacy and recency effects. Results show U-shaped accuracy profiles, revealing mechanisms of long- and short-term memory and memory allocation influenced by semantic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how state-space language models manage memory retention and forgetting through primacy and recency effects.

Method: Behavioral structured recall tasks applied on the Mamba architecture to analyze memory mechanisms, supported by ablations and perturbations on large models.

Result: Revealed three memory mechanisms: sparse channels for long-term memory, delta-modulated recurrence for short-term memory, and dynamic semantic modulation affecting memory allocation.

Conclusion: Memory retention in state-space models is determined by distinct mechanisms, illuminating challenges of balancing long- and short-term memory and adaptation to semantic patterns.

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) for classifying texts related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), exploring various adaptation techniques for performance optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking progress toward SDGs requires analyzing extensive, complex data, making automated text classification essential.

Method: The study evaluates proprietary and open-source LLMs for multi-class text classification and tests adaptation techniques like Zero-Shot, Few-Shot Learning, and Fine-Tuning.

Result: Smaller LLMs optimized through prompt engineering can match the performance of larger models such as OpenAI's GPT in the SDG context.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering enhances smaller LLMs' utility for text classification tasks, achieving results comparable to larger models, aiding SDG-related data analysis.

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning enhances large language models by using abstract reasoning prototypes and achieves significant improvements in logical, planning, general reasoning, and mathematics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the mechanisms underpinning cross-domain generalization in large reasoning models and improve their reasoning capabilities through shared abstract patterns.

Method: Proposed the ProtoReasoning framework, which uses scalable prototypical representations like Prolog and PDDL for reasoning. Includes prototype construction, a verification system, and scalable problem synthesis.

Result: ProtoReasoning achieves improvements of 4.7% on logical reasoning, 6.3% on planning tasks, 4.0% on general reasoning, and 1.0% on mathematics tasks compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Reasoning prototypes enable enhanced cross-domain generalization in large language models by grounding diverse tasks in shared reasoning structures, validating their importance for scalable reasoning frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

### [37] [MinosEval: Distinguishing Factoid and Non-Factoid for Tailored Open-Ended QA Evaluation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15215)
*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval is proposed as a novel evaluation method for open-ended QA to address challenges like nuanced reasoning, semantic diversity, and lack of interpretability in existing approaches, achieving better alignment with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended QA evaluation demands nuanced reasoning, diverse answer expressions, and interpretability, yet existing metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and LLM-based approaches fail to account for semantic diversity and intuitive interpretability, notably ignoring distinctions between factoid and non-factoid questions.

Method: MinosEval distinguishes between factoid and non-factoid questions, applying an adaptive key-point scoring for factoid and instance-aware listwise ranking for non-factoid questions.

Result: MinosEval outperforms existing metrics and methods, aligning better with human annotations and providing more interpretable evaluation results across diverse QA datasets.

Conclusion: MinosEval offers an improved and interpretable approach to evaluating open-ended QA, addressing limitations in current methods through tailored strategies for different question types.

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.

TL;DR: This paper examines the ability of current language models to understand linguistic variations in Basque and Spanish using a novel NLI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well current language technologies cope with linguistic variation in Basque and Spanish, which is critical for building inclusive and robust NLP models.

Method: The authors introduced a manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish with their varieties and tested encoder-only and decoder-based LLMs using crosslingual and in-context learning experiments.

Result: The study found a performance drop in handling linguistic variations, particularly noticeable in Basque, with encoder-only models struggling with Western Basque due to its distance from the standard form.

Conclusion: Performance degradation in handling linguistic variations is influenced by the linguistic distance of dialects from the standard form. This highlights the need for refinement in models to address language diversity effectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants. Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available.

Result: The domain-specific Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B model achieves F1=0.68 in relation extraction. DeepSeek with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% on open-domain datasets, bettering alternative methods.

Conclusion: Graph RAG provides a low-cost, efficient solution for extracting and aligning historical knowledge, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability for humanities research.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction, reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B, with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12), effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and humanities research.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Thunder-DeID, a de-identification framework to balance open justice and personal data protection in South Korea, achieving state-of-the-art performance for court judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The balance between transparency in judicial disclosures and personal data protection is compromised due to inadequacies in the current court judgment de-identification process and vague legal definitions of personal identifiers.

Method: The authors introduced the Thunder-DeID framework, providing a Korean legal dataset with annotated judgments, categorizing personal identifiers, and developing a DNN-based de-identification pipeline.

Result: Their proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in de-identifying personally identifiable information from South Korean court judgments.

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID offers a scalable and legally compliant solution for de-identifying court judgments, addressing privacy concerns while enabling open judicial access.

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the de-identification of court judgments.

TL;DR: The survey explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for matching clinical trials with patients, highlighting challenges, existing approaches, and suggesting future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trial recruitment is a complex and underoptimized process, as it requires matching trials written in natural language with patient data, which can be fragmented and presented across structured and unstructured formats. LLMs offer potential to fill this gap by leveraging their knowledge aggregation and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study critically examines benchmarks, existing approaches, and evaluation frameworks for applying LLMs to trial-patient matching. It surveys current practices, highlights their limitations, and contextualizes emerging LLM-based methods.

Result: LLMs present opportunities for more generalized solutions to trial-patient matching compared to traditional trial-specific methods. However, proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks remain obstacles.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in revolutionizing clinical trial recruitment, overcoming model accessibility issues and refining evaluation benchmarks are necessary steps for broader adoption and efficacy in clinical research.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LID for low-resource languages performs poorly due to class imbalance and domain bias, as such languages often have limited training data, usually restricted to single-domain sources like the Bible.

Method: The paper proposes a supervised contrastive learning (SCL) method to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages, aiming to address class imbalance and bias issues.

Result: The SCL method improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, emphasizing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed SCL approach enhances LID models for low-resource languages, effectively reducing class imbalance and bias, and demonstrating measurable performance gains.

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Method: The study uses ICU discharge notes from the MIMIC-IV dataset to construct a controlled testing framework with real-world and synthetic counterfactuals. Five LLMs are evaluated in zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations for sensitivity and downstream reasoning.

Result: Zero-shot models exhibited better counterfactual reasoning, while fine-tuned models showed stability but weaker responses to clinical changes. The study also found consistent demographic biases across outputs, highlighting fairness issues.

Conclusion: Behavioral testing can effectively uncover reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs, enabling the development of safer and more transparent AI systems for medical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often struggle to adapt to local socio-cultural contexts despite being globally effective, highlighting a need for tools to evaluate cultural understanding.

Method: SANSKRITI provides a dataset focusing on 16 cultural attributes of India, with evaluations conducted on various LMs including leading LLMs, ILMs, and SLMs.

Result: Significant disparities are observed in models' abilities to address culturally nuanced queries, especially region-specific ones.

Conclusion: SANSKRITI advances cultural understanding assessments in language models and sets a benchmark for future improvements.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity. Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive, culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

*Raghvendra Kumar,S. A. Mohammed Salman,Aryan Sahu,Tridib Nandi,Pragathi Y. P.,Sriparna Saha,Jose G. Moreno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces COSMMIC, a novel multimodal, multilingual dataset designed for summarization tasks in nine Indian languages by utilizing articles, images, and reader comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research on comment-aware summarization for Indian languages and create a dataset that incorporates diverse modalities like text, images, and user comments.

Method: The study involves developing the COSMMIC dataset, which integrates article-text, images, and comments. Summarization is done using configurations with text-only, text+comments, text+images, and text+images+comments. Models like LLama3 and GPT-4 are used, along with comment classifiers and multilingual image insight tools.

Result: State-of-the-art language models and classifiers effectively process the dataset, showing enhanced summarization capabilities when text, comments, and images are combined.

Conclusion: COSMMIC fills a vital resource gap in NLP for Indian languages, advancing research in multimodal and comment-sensitive summarization.

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

*Stanley Ngugi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a fine-tuning method for improving cross-lingual lexical alignment in low-resource languages like Swahili using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap in low-resource languages (LRLs) due to data scarcity and poor cross-lingual lexical alignment, which hampers tasks like translation and information retrieval.

Method: TLI leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and contrastive learning to fine-tune the model's embeddings, specifically targeting those from an early internal layer with demonstrated strong lexical alignment.

Result: TLI improves lexical alignment for trained Swahili-English word pairs, boosting cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%) and showing strong generalization to unseen pairs with a similar improvement.

Conclusion: TLI provides an efficient strategy for enhancing cross-lingual lexical alignment in low-resource languages, leveraging early-layer knowledge in LLMs without extensive parameter changes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating multimodal large language models in GUI interactions, highlighting nuanced failure modes, and improving reliability with novel metrics and techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models exhibit systematic localization errors during GUI interactions, necessitating a robust evaluation and improvement framework.

Method: The authors propose a fine-grained evaluation category, introduce the Peak Sharpness Score to measure model uncertainty, and develop Context-Aware Cropping as a training-free enhancement technique.

Result: Experimental results showcase the efficacy of the proposed methods, yielding more interpretative and robust GUI agent behaviors.

Conclusion: The study advances the reliability and interpretability of multimodal GUI agents through targeted evaluation and optimization methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in designing large language model multi-agent systems, including architecture inefficiencies, issues with cross-domain generalizability, and performance lapses as tasks and agent complexities scale.

Method: AgentGroupChat-V2 introduces three innovations: parallel processing through hierarchical task decomposition, dynamic LLM collaborations tailored to task types, and optimized agent frameworks using divide-and-conquer tactics.

Result: The framework showed significant improvements in experimental benchmarks, achieving notable accuracy in GSM8K, AIME, and HumanEval tasks, often surpassing state-of-the-art methods, especially for high-difficulty scenarios.

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2 offers a robust, scalable solution for general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems and demonstrates substantial benefits in tackling complex reasoning tasks across domains.

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show good results in reasoning benchmarks, yet their true reasoning capabilities versus reliance on memorization remain unclear. RE-IMAGINE is introduced to generate problem variations for assessing reasoning hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether the reasoning ability shown by LLMs comes from true reasoning or training data recall, and provide methods to systematically evaluate reasoning capabilities.

Method: A framework called RE-IMAGINE generates problems by altering symbolic representations to test levels of reasoning hierarchy, avoiding reliance on mere memorization.

Result: Evaluations using RE-IMAGINE show reduced accuracy in LLMs on varied benchmark problems, suggesting reliance on statistical recall instead of genuine reasoning.

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE shows LLMs might rely on memorization rather than deep reasoning, promoting further study into reasoning across domains and causal reasoning hierarchies.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations, interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new post-training approach called Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS) to improve grounding in LLMs using external context, reducing hallucinations and enhancing factual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supplementing LLMs with external knowledge often fails to ensure accurate grounding during response generation, leading to hallucinations. A better approach is needed to ensure external context is effectively integrated.

Method: The method, CINGS, involves training LLMs with the relevant context prepended to the response but calculates the loss only on the response tokens, masking the context during loss computation.

Result: CINGS improves grounding for LLMs in both textual and visual domains, reduces hallucinations, and enhances factual consistency across multiple datasets and benchmarks without compromising downstream performance.

Conclusion: CINGS changes the model's behavior to rely more on external context, offering a complementary approach to inference-time techniques for better grounded, factually consistent generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARE, a framework for efficient annotations of multi-step reasoning tasks, achieving improvements in model performance and efficiency across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and high-quality automated process annotation for LLMs is challenging but essential for advancing step-wise reasoning capabilities of these models.

Method: SPARE enables single-pass step annotation by aligning solution steps to reference solutions, with reasoning-based evaluation applied to four datasets across mathematical, question-answering, and spatial reasoning domains.

Result: SPARE improves reasoning performance for fine-tuning with offline RL and training reward models, achieving competitive mathematical performance at 2.6 times greater efficiency compared to tree search-based annotation.

Conclusion: SPARE enhances multi-step reasoning in LLMs, advances offline RL fine-tuning methods, and offers efficient, high-quality annotations for research. Public access to SPARE's codebase promotes reproducibility and continued study.

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EmoBi, a framework utilizing emotion-guided bidirectional dynamic interaction for detecting hyperbole and metaphor, showing significantly improved performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting hyperbole and metaphor arising from their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, and to explore the emotional associations behind these rhetorical devices.

Method: EmoBi incorporates an emotion analysis module to explore emotional connotations, an emotion-based domain mapping module for deeper semantic understanding, and a bidirectional dynamic interaction module to enhance mutual detection of hyperbole and metaphor.

Result: EmoBi achieves significant improvements in hyperbole detection on TroFi (+28.1% F1 score) and metaphor detection on HYPO-L (+23.1% F1 score), surpassing all baseline methods across four datasets.

Conclusion: EmoBi demonstrates the effectiveness of emotion-guided dynamic interaction for enhancing hyperbole and metaphor detection, offering substantial advances in these NLP tasks.

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection.

TL;DR: The paper explores how reinforcement learning and internal reasoning can enhance answer grounding in large language models, achieving better performance on queries and citations compared to instruction-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of instruction-tuned language models in generating accurate and well-cited responses, particularly when dealing with unanswerable questions or citation challenges.

Method: The authors use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method, guided by verifiable rewards like answer correctness and citation sufficiency, and implement a two-stage training process to optimize answer generation followed by refusal behavior.

Result: Experiments on ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA datasets demonstrate that reasoning-augmented models outperform existing instruction-tuned models in accuracy, citation quality, and handling unanswerable queries.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of reasoning, stage-wise training, and outcome-focused reinforcement learning in improving the grounding, reliability, and verifiability of large language models.

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RATTENTION, a variant of local attention, combines local and linear attention mechanisms to balance performance and efficiency in short-context regimes, achieving comparable results to full-attention models with smaller window sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and performance tradeoff of local-global attention models, particularly in short-context tasks, by addressing the limitation of local attention ignoring out-of-window tokens.

Method: Introduce RATTENTION, which integrates local attention and a specialized linear attention mechanism. The model uses a reduced window size and a recurrent linear attention component while employing a specialized kernel implementation to maintain efficiency.

Result: RATTENTION demonstrates superior performance-efficiency tradeoff across pretraining experiments at 3B and 12B scales, matches full-attention models' performance with a window size of 512, and achieves enhanced long-context performance on the RULER benchmark.

Conclusion: RATTENTION shifts the Pareto frontier in local-global models, enabling efficiency gains and high performance without sacrificing training speed.

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*John X. Morris,Junjie Oscar Yin,Woojeong Kim,Vitaly Shmatikov,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on approximating training data for language models using their weights, presenting a gradient-based approach that retrieves high-matching public data, achieving close-to-original model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the fact that, although many language models have open weights, their training datasets are often inaccessible, limiting reproducibility and study.

Method: The researchers developed a gradient-based method to recover high-matching training data from a public corpus by comparing model weights and finetuned versions. Metrics and baselines were also proposed.

Result: The method showed significant improvements in model performance, recovering high-quality public training data that allowed models to approach expert performance benchmarks on tasks like classification and supervised-finetuning.

Conclusion: Approximating missing training data using model weights can enable high-performing models even when direct access to original training data is unavailable, enhancing reproducibility and utility in NLP research.

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task, our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%, approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3, compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

*Shufan Li,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive Generation (PredGen), a framework to reduce latency in audio responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) during real-time voice chat by speculatively decoding user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in voice chat applications suffer from latency issues, particularly on consumer-grade hardware, due to the time needed to generate the first sentence for text-to-speech (TTS) systems.

Method: The PredGen framework employs speculative decoding to generate candidate responses while the user is still speaking, reducing the delay in starting TTS processing.

Result: Experiments show that PredGen reduces audio response latency by approximately 2x across varied datasets while adding minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: PredGen offers an effective solution for optimizing user experiences in real-time voice chat systems by reducing response latency without significant computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models struggle with verifying scientific claims in multimodal contexts; SciVer aims to fill this evaluation gap.

Method: The SciVer benchmark includes 3,000 expert-annotated examples from 1,113 papers and evaluates four core reasoning types in multimodal claim verification.

Result: Tests with 21 state-of-the-art models revealed significant underperformance compared to human experts, along with identified model limitations.

Conclusion: This work highlights the need for improved comprehension and reasoning capabilities in multimodal foundation models, driven by insights from SciVer.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over 1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific literature tasks.

### [60] [DiscoSG: Towards Discourse-Level Text Scene Graph Parsing through Iterative Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15583)
*Shaoqing Lin,Chong Teng,Fei Li,Donghong Ji,Lizhen Qu,Zhuang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new task, DiscoSG, to address challenges in discourse-level visual description parsing by using the DiscoSG-DS dataset and proposing the DiscoSG-Refiner method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text scene graph parsers struggle with multi-sentence discourse visual descriptions, leading to fragmented outputs and weaker performance in Vision-Language Model tasks.

Method: The authors developed DiscoSG-Refiner, a two-step parsing method using small PLMs where one drafts base graphs and another iteratively edits them for improved efficiency and performance.

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner achieves a 30% SPICE improvement over baselines and 86x faster inference compared to GPT-4, enhancing downstream tasks like caption evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations in discourse-level parsing, facilitates efficient inference, and improves the use of visual-language models for complex captions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/ShaoqLin/DiscoSG

*Negar Foroutan,Angelika Romanou,Matin Ansaripour,Julian Martin Eisenschlos,Karl Aberer,Rémi Lebret*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of vision-language models in tackling complex, multi-modal reasoning across long-context documents. The evaluation reveals significant performance gaps, especially for open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of automatic document understanding in scenarios requiring complex reasoning over multi-modal long-context inputs.

Method: The authors designed WikiMixQA, a benchmark with 1,000 MCQs derived from tables and charts across 4,000 Wikipedia pages, and evaluated the performance of 12 vision-language models on this dataset.

Result: Proprietary models achieved around 70% accuracy with direct context but struggled with long-document retrieval. The best-performing proprietary model (GPT-4-o) exceeded 50% accuracy, while open-source models performed substantially worse, maxing out at 27%.

Conclusion: WikiMixQA serves as a critical resource for understanding limitations in document processing by highlighting the difficulties of multi-modal and long-context reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context, multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for advancing document understanding research.

*Bernardo Leite,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pedro Pinto,Abel Ferreira,Luís Abreu,Isabel Rangel,Sandra Monteiro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI's ability to generate Portuguese MCQs, finding them comparable to human-authored ones but identifying issues with clarity, answerability, and distractor design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of efficient and high-quality Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) generation for languages other than English, targeting reading comprehension and curriculum alignment.

Method: The study generates MCQs using generative AI models, evaluates them via expert reviews, and analyzes psychometric properties based on student responses, focusing on Portuguese narratives for elementary education.

Result: AI-generated MCQs match human-authored quality overall but face issues in semantic clarity, answerability, and creating engaging distractors.

Conclusion: While generative models show promise in automating MCQ creation, advancements are needed for improving semantic clarity and distractor quality, especially for practical applications.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention -- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

### [63] [The Compositional Architecture of Regret in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15617)
*Xiangxiang Cui,Shu Yang,Tianjin Huang,Wanyu Lin,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops methods to analyze regret mechanisms in large language models to improve reliability, proposing new datasets and metrics to identify regret layers and neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how regret expressions are encoded in large language models is key to improving reliability and unraveling neural cognition.

Method: Proposes three key contributions: constructing a regret dataset, a metric called S-CDI to locate regret layers, and the RDS metric to classify neurons and analyze patterns.

Result: Identified an optimal regret layer using S-CDI, observed an M-shaped coupling-decoupling pattern, and categorized neurons into regret, non-regret, and dual types with the RDS metric.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework to analyze and classify regret mechanisms in language models, aiding in enhancing their reliability and understanding neuron functions.

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

*Yuka Machino,Matthias Hofer,Max Siegel,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the cross-cultural misunderstandings around English intensifiers like "quite" and "very" by using a computational cognitive model, finding that differences arise from both literal meanings and perceptions of utterance cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear origins of cross-cultural miscommunication in English intensifiers, aiming to whether the issue stems from literal meanings or pragmatic factors like politeness norms.

Method: The authors conducted three experiments and developed a computational cognitive model to analyze how British and American English speakers interpret intensifiers, balancing informativity, politeness, and utterance costs.

Result: The study found cross-cultural differences arise from both distinct literal word meanings and differing weights placed on utterance cost, providing insight into the interplay of semantic and pragmatic factors.

Conclusion: Cross-cultural differences in interpreting intensifiers are complex, involving an intricate interaction between literal meanings and pragmatic factors like cost, challenging oversimplified semantic or politeness-based explanations.

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper, we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity, politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

### [65] [Revisiting Compositional Generalization Capability of Large Language Models Considering Instruction Following Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15629)
*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can generate sentences following specified concept orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address LLM limitations in adhering to specific concept orders when generating text, which is important for both compositional generalization and instruction-following capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark (Ordered CommonGen) to assess ordered coverage in generated text and evaluate 36 LLMs for their performance in this area.

Result: The study shows that LLMs often exhibit biases toward specific concept order patterns, resulting in low-diversity outputs and inconsistent adherence to specified orders. The best-performing model achieved 75% ordered coverage.

Conclusion: LLMs need significant improvements in instruction-following and compositional generalization abilities, as demonstrated by the benchmark evaluation.

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts. However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance authorship attribution accuracy for the Romanian language, leveraging simple yet effective stylometric features, especially in resource-constrained or less-explored linguistic contexts.

Method: Six machine learning models (SVM, LR, k-NN, DT, RF, ANN) were evaluated using the ROST corpus, employing character n-gram features, specifically 5-gram features for classification.

Result: ANN achieved the highest accuracy, including perfect classification in some runs, showcasing the efficiency of interpretable character n-gram approaches.

Conclusion: Lightweight and interpretable character n-gram methods are efficient and suitable for the Romanian authorship attribution task, rivaling more complex techniques.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight, interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource, constrained or under-studied language settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a novel reinforcement learning framework to enhance reasoning consistency in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models exhibit limitations in consistent and robust reasoning, creating a need for methods to improve reliability and consistency.

Method: The authors propose CC-Learn, which optimizes cohorts of similar questions using reinforcement learning with a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, retrieval bonuses, and rejection penalties.

Result: Experiments on reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn improves accuracy and reasoning stability compared to pretrained and supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Conclusion: Cohort-level RL improves reasoning consistency and reliability in LLMs, validating CC-Learn as an effective solution to this challenge.

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent, robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs.

*Tommaso Green,Martin Gubri,Haritz Puerto,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy risks in reasoning traces of large language models (LLMs) used as personal agents, finding that increased reasoning steps amplify sensitive data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the assumption that reasoning traces of LLMs are safe from privacy leakage and to analyze the inherent risks associated with internal model processes.

Method: Conducted probing and agentic evaluations on LLMs to study test-time compute approaches, focusing on increased reasoning steps and their impact on data leakage.

Result: Demonstrated that increased reasoning steps in models lead to more verbose reasoning traces, thereby expanding the privacy attack surface, while also making the models' final outputs more cautious.

Conclusion: Privacy concerns in AI must address internal reasoning processes, as improving reasoning utility comes with an increased risk of sensitive data being exposed.

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

*Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Chi-kiu Lo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if machine translation (MT) systems preserve gender neutrality when translating gender-ambiguous English text into languages with grammatical gender, finding most systems fall short.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address representational harms caused by misgendering in machine translation, particularly when translating from gender-ambiguous languages like English to grammatical gender languages.

Method: 21 machine translation systems are tested for their sensitivity to gender ambiguity in translations across three language pairs. Gender-neutral strategies applied by these systems are observed and categorized. The analysis includes exploring the impact of gender stereotypes.

Result: Most machine translation systems fail to provide gender-neutral translations. Only a small number manage to use specific strategies to achieve gender neutrality, depending on the target language.

Conclusion: Current machine translation models inadequately address gender ambiguity, highlighting the need for improved approaches to ensure gender inclusivity in translations.

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English, maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific strategies, depending on the target language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenRecal, a novel distillation framework for transferring knowledge between diverse vision-language models (VLMs), achieving superior performance over large-scale open and closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to address the computational inefficiency of large vision-language models (VLMs), which hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Existing architectures differ widely, making knowledge distillation across VLMs challenging.

Method: The proposed method, GenRecal, incorporates a 'Recalibrator' to align and adapt feature representations between different types of VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer between them.

Result: Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GenRecal significantly improves the performance of smaller VLMs, surpassing even large-scale open- and closed-source systems.

Conclusion: GenRecal demonstrates an effective and general-purpose solution for heterogeneous knowledge distillation in VLMs, paving the way for deploying efficient models in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios, particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhantomHunter, a detector for identifying text generated by privately-tuned LLMs, achieving F1 scores over 96%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting LLM-generated text from privately-tuned models, which existing methods struggle to handle, leading to issues like misinformation and academic misconduct.

Method: The method involves a family-aware learning framework that captures shared family-level traits of base models and their derivatives, rather than memorizing individual characteristics.

Result: PhantomHunter demonstrates superior performance over seven baseline methods and three industrial services, achieving F1 scores exceeding 96%.

Conclusion: PhantomHunter effectively detects LLM-generated text from unseen, privately-tuned models, addressing a critical issue in combating misuse of LLMs.

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance. Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora, resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice. To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores of over 96%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal irony detection models struggle to identify complex graphical-textual implicit correlations accurately.

Method: SemIRNet uses ConceptNet for common-sense reasoning, implements semantic similarity detection modules at word and sample levels, and employs contrastive learning loss for feature optimization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improvements of 1.64% in accuracy and 2.88% in F1 scores on a benchmark dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Knowledge fusion, semantic similarity detection, and contrastive learning are pivotal in enhancing multimodal irony detection performance.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples. Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64% and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model performance.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However, challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function, enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based reasoning tasks.

*Harsha Koduri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLLa is a neuro-symbolic system for monitoring animals through a modular approach combining visual identification, natural language processing, and logical reasoning, offering interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for monitoring animal populations in natural environments with systems capable of interpreting visual data and responding to human language queries in a transparent manner.

Method: ViLLa combines three components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations, a language parser for understanding questions, and a symbolic reasoning layer for logic-based inference, enabling answers to questions about the content in images.

Result: ViLLa successfully answers queries about animal imagery by grounding visual detections into symbolic facts and applying predefined logical rules, demonstrating modularity and transparency.

Conclusion: ViLLa provides an interpretable and modular approach to animal monitoring systems, bridging visual data with structured language understanding and reasoning, differentiating itself from black-box models.

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured, human-interpretable queries.

*Ke Song,Yunhe Wu,Chunchit Siu,Huiyuan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphGSOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy predictions for autonomous driving by incorporating fine-grained semantic and geometric graph attention into the 3D Gaussian Splating framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splating methods neglect semantic correlations and lack geometric constraints, leading to boundary ambiguities and inefficient feature aggregation.

Method: The GraphGSOcc model introduces a Dual Gaussians Graph Attention mechanism using dual graph structures (geometric and semantic graphs) and a Multi-scale Graph Attention framework for effective feature extraction.

Result: GraphGSOcc achieves a 24.10% mIoU on the SurroundOcc dataset, improves mIoU by 1.97%, and reduces memory usage by 13.7% compared to GaussianWorld.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses limitations in existing methods, enhancing prediction accuracy and memory efficiency for 3D semantic occupancy tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAVID-X, a dataset pairing AI-generated videos with annotations and rationales, and DAVID-XR1, a model for explainable AI video detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need to identify and explain AI-generated videos, as they are increasingly pervasive and challenging to verify.

Method: The researchers created DAVID-X, a dataset with defect annotations, and designed DAVID-XR1, a video-language model offering interpretable reasoning.

Result: The model, fine-tuned on the dataset, effectively generalizes across various video generators and presents explainable video detection.

Conclusion: This study advances transparent, explainable methods for detecting AI-generated videos, emphasizing their importance for accountability and trustworthiness.

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms, the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However, the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in directly applying DETR-like architectures for monocular 3D object detection.

Method: The method introduces a Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism for denoising integration, Variational Query Denoising to prevent gradient vanishing, and a self-distillation strategy for iterative query refinement.

Result: MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the KITTI benchmark and delivers significant improvements in multi-view detection on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: MonoVQD effectively advances DETR-based monocular 3D detection and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Precisely localizing 3D objects from a single image constitutes a central challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartIR, an iterative refinement method based on structured instructions, to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in chart-to-code generation tasks, achieving superior performance compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at visual tasks but underperform in chart-to-code generation, requiring innovative solutions for accurate visual-to-code translation.

Method: The paper proposes a two-part iterative refinement approach: (1) using description and difference structured instructions to transform visual chart features into language representations, and (2) decomposing the process into initial code generation and iterative refinement stages.

Result: Experimental evidence indicates that ChartIR outperforms competing methods on open-source (Qwen2-VL) and closed-source (GPT-4o) models in chart-to-code tasks.

Conclusion: ChartIR demonstrates that structured instructions and an iterative refinement approach can significantly boost MLLMs' capabilities in complex visual-to-code translation tasks, addressing shortcomings in current methods.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities. While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

TL;DR: PictSure is an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework that optimizes image embeddings to improve few-shot image classification (FSIC) performance, particularly in out-of-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot image classification faces challenges in data-scarce domains due to difficulty in collecting large labeled datasets. This work investigates how embedding models impact the success of ICL-based FSIC.

Method: PictSure focuses on systematic analysis of embedding model components such as architecture, pretraining methods, and fine-tuning strategies to understand their effect on FSIC performance.

Result: Experiments reveal that embedding model pretraining significantly influences FSIC outcomes. PictSure surpasses existing models in out-of-domain benchmarks while achieving comparable in-domain performance.

Conclusion: Embedding models are crucial for few-shot classification tasks in ICL settings, and optimizing their pretraining can yield improved outcomes, as demonstrated by PictSure.

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings. In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook kernel size selection in CNNs, which greatly impacts computational efficiency, feature extraction, and model performance.

Method: The paper introduces BKSEF, integrating information theory, signal processing, and learning theory to determine optimal kernel sizes for CNN layers.

Result: BKSEF improved accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduced FLOPs by 42.8% on multiple datasets. Real-world applications validated its effectiveness in medical imaging and edge device scenarios.

Conclusion: Kernel size can be optimized rather than fixed, and BKSEF offers a theoretical and practical solution for more efficient and application-specific CNN designs.

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based approach to automate video annotation in retail, achieving high accuracy and significant cost and time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation methods in retail video labeling are time-consuming, costly, and non-robust, calling for an efficient automated solution.

Method: The approach integrates deep neural networks with object detection tailored for retail videos to automate key-frame identification and annotation of products and customers.

Result: The model achieves human-like accuracy, reduces operational costs by an average of 2 times, and minimizes human intervention to under 5% of frames.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances the efficiency of retail video annotation, making it highly practical for applications like customer behavior analysis and in-store security.

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications, including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

*Zhengquan Zhang,Feng Xu,Mengmi Zhang*

TL;DR: The paper introduces UPNet, a neural network for Active View Selection (AVS) in 3D reconstruction, using uncertainty maps to efficiently select the most informative viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current AVS methods for 3D object reconstruction and reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.

Method: UPNet predicts neural uncertainty maps for candidate viewpoints using a single input image, then selects optimal viewpoints by suppressing redundancy and leveraging these maps.

Result: The method uses half the required viewpoints, reduces computational overhead by up to 400 times, and achieves over 50% hardware resource savings while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: UPNet generalizes well to novel object categories without additional training, providing an efficient and scalable AVS solution.

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of aligning text-to-image models to ensure they accurately capture user intent while also maintaining safety and fairness.

Method: The paper proposes DPO-Kernels with three improvements: Hybrid Loss combining embedding-based and probability-based goals, Kernelized Representations utilizing advanced kernels for feature transformation, and Divergence Selection introducing alternatives like Wasserstein divergence for better stability. The DETONATE benchmark and the Alignment Quality Index (AQI) are also introduced to evaluate performance.

Result: DPO-Kernels demonstrate strong generalization, safety, and fairness, and the DETONATE benchmark highlights vulnerabilities in current T2I models.

Conclusion: DPO-Kernels enhance alignment in text-to-image models while addressing social biases, offering a comprehensive framework for evaluation via the DETONATE benchmark and AQI.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically, we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches struggle to handle complex scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, which is critical to understand relationships across images.

Method: PeRL employs permuted image sequences for diverse positional exploration and incorporates a rollout filtering mechanism to refine learning trajectories for optimal behavior.

Result: PeRL outperforms other R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-image benchmarks and comparable results on single-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: PeRL improves reasoning in multimodal tasks, particularly in scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, making it a significant advancement in VLM reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Conclusion: FCRE effectively mitigates privacy risks by accurately identifying membership in high-risk contexts like medical imaging, offering an improvement over prior methods.

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns. Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Motivation: The study aims to enhance jet tagging accuracy, a crucial task in high-energy physics for advancing new physics searches and precision measurements.

Method: ViT and ViT-CNN hybrid models are evaluated for jet classification. Multi-channel images based on calorimeter energy deposits and reconstructed tracks are used for end-to-end learning.

Conclusion: ViTs offer significant advancement over CNNs for calorimeter image-based jet classification, providing a robust benchmark framework and dataset for future research.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for compliance detection lack portability, scalability, and accuracy, especially in robotic applications.

Method: Two compliance prediction models leveraging LRCNs and Transformer architectures were developed and tested with data from GelSight vision-based tactile sensors.

Result: The proposed models significantly outperform baseline methods in compliance estimation, with findings linking sensor hardness to estimation difficulty.

Conclusion: The research advances compliance detection accuracy and highlights challenges related to sensor-object hardness differences, making it promising for diverse applications.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering, agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for text extraction from historical maps, which outperforms existing methods using a novel hyper-local sampling module and a synthetic dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting text from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of effective methods and training data, with current approaches being limited by ad-hoc designs or ineffective feature extraction in complex maps.

Method: PALETTE introduces hyper-local sampling and positional embeddings to extract precise image features for text instances, along with SynthMap+ for generating synthetic training data.

Result: PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms the state-of-the-art on two benchmark datasets, especially for long and angled text. It has been used to process 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey collection, generating 100 million text labels.

Conclusion: PALETTE and SynthMap+ address key challenges in historical map text extraction, offering a significant improvement in performance and scalability for supporting map-related tasks.

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer is a unified framework for style transfer and text-driven stylization that ensures artist-level quality and maintains original image content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional style transfer methods face issues such as inefficiencies and lack of unification across tasks. This study seeks to resolve these problems while achieving high-quality and artist-level results.

Method: The proposed approach includes semantic-based style injection using BLIP and CLIP, a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, and a training-free triple diffusion process to fine-tune model features and maintain text control.

Result: StyleWallfacer achieves high-quality image-driven style transfer, text-driven stylization, and introduces image color editing, all while preserving the original content.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms traditional methods by addressing inefficiencies, offering scalable solutions, and achieving artist-level style transfer and text-driven stylization.

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer process for the first time.

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses two issues in vector quantization for autoregressive models: training instability and codebook collapse, using Wasserstein distance for improved alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models rely on vector quantization, which faces problems such as training instability due to quantization errors and codebook collapse from poor utilization of code vectors.

Method: The authors use the Wasserstein distance to better align the distributions of features and code vectors, improving codebook utilization and reducing quantization errors.

Result: Near 100% codebook utilization is achieved, along with significant reduction in quantization error, validated through both empirical and theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed approach resolves key challenges in vector quantization, enhancing stability and efficiency for autoregressive model training.

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free methods leveraging Large Vision Models (LVMs) struggle with low-contrast medical images due to ineffective use of negative prompts.

Method: The paper introduces a Confidence Map Synergy Module that integrates DINOv2 and SAM for generating high-quality confidence maps. From these maps, positive and negative point sets are selected, followed by K-means clustering, and then used as prompts for SAM segmentation.

Result: SynPo shows effective segmentation results on low-contrast medical images and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SynPo method improves upon existing training-free segmentation techniques by addressing the weakness of negative prompts and effectively utilizes LVMs for robust medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Motivation: To address irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap issues in local coordinate-based point cloud aggregation, and to overcome high computational overhead and noise sensitivity in geometric structure encoding enhancement methods.

Method: Proposes PDSA, which uses high-dimensional correlation and lightweight cross-stage structural descriptors to correct feature distribution during aggregation, reduce variance, and separate classes with long-distance modeling; introduces a key point mechanism to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Experimental results on semantic segmentation and classification tasks using different baselines validate the method's generalization, demonstrating significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. Ablation and visualization results reinforce effectiveness and rationality.

Conclusion: PDSA substantially enhances point cloud analysis by improving efficiency and robustness while lowering computational costs, offering a generalizable solution validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data. While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiograms is crucial, but ultrasound images are noisy and present low contrast, making this task challenging.

Method: Echo-DND combines Gaussian and Bernoulli noises with a multi-scale fusion conditioning module and spatial coherence calibration to improve segmentation precision and maintain spatial integrity.

Result: The model scored high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Echo-DND sets a new standard for echocardiogram segmentation and shows potential for broader applications in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.

*Ziling Huang,Yidan Zhang,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task called Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis) that combines corpus-level image retrieval and pixel-level object localization, addressing limitations of existing techniques. The authors also curate a benchmark and provide a baseline model for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual search methods either focus on image retrieval at a high level or achieve fine-grained localization but assume the object is present in all images, making these systems unsuitable for web-scale datasets.

Method: The authors propose ReSeDis as a unified task combining both retrieval and localization, curate a benchmark with unique object-instance mappings to eliminate unintended matches, design a task-specific metric, and provide a zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model.

Result: A curated benchmark and task-specific metric were developed to study the ReSeDis task, while a baseline zero-shot model revealed a significant performance gap, showcasing room for improvement in multimodal search systems.

Conclusion: ReSeDis provides an innovative, realistic framework for developing scalable, robust multimodal visual search engines, blending object retrieval and pixel-level localization.

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision. Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Motivation: Currently, highly specialized models in medical imaging struggle with limited adaptability and require expert resources for task-specific development. The authors aim to overcome these challenges by exploring generalist models.

Method: The study uses visual in-context learning (VICL) to train a generalist model for retinal OCT analysis, providing task adaptability based on a few examples at inference time. A comprehensive evaluation protocol is also proposed.

Result: The authors establish a baseline for VICL in retinal OCT analysis by rigorously evaluating a state-of-the-art VICL method on multiple datasets. They reveal both the potential and limitations of this approach.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of VICL for generalist modeling in medical imaging while advocating for further research, enabled by the open release of their code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast, generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and practical adoption, we openly release our code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns arising from the exploitation of publicly posted images by search engines and similar tools leveraging advanced vision-language models.

Method: The PSIC method incorporates Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) to guide image decoding and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) function for optimization. It also uses adaptive multi-objective optimization strategies integrated into Learned Image Compression models.

Result: The method effectively prevents semantic interpretation of compressed images by VLP models while maintaining perceptual quality and flexibility in reconstructing images under customizable conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed PSIC method is a plug-and-play solution integrated into most LIC models, balancing perceptual quality with privacy protection while demonstrating effectiveness in extensive experiments.

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP) models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DM-FNet, a two-stage diffusion model for multimodal medical image fusion, significantly improving image quality by addressing limitations in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods struggle with capturing detailed features and achieving sufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to subpar image quality.

Method: The study proposes a two-stage framework. Stage I uses a diffusion-based UNet for feature-rich image reconstruction. Stage II improves feature recognition with a fusion network and integrates specialized fusion modules to manage different modalities.

Result: Experimental results indicate DM-FNet outperforms other methods in various medical imaging types, delivering images with balanced brightness, color, contrast, and details.

Conclusion: DM-FNet offers a robust network structure and hybrid loss function, achieving superior fusion, retaining critical image features and ensuring high-quality fused images for medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.

Conclusion: The proposed video-SALMONN 2 model sets a new standard in accurate and efficient video captioning, delivering improvements with a relatively smaller 7-billion parameter model.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by 28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar size.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing. Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges, including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale feature fusion and can adaptively focus on critical feature regions. The experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets, robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

*Qingsong Yan,Qiang Wang,Kaiyong Zhao,Jie Chen,Bo Li,Xiaowen Chu,Fei Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RA-NeRF, a method to improve camera pose accuracy for 3D reconstruction using NeRF, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks struggle with accurate camera pose estimation, especially under complex trajectories.

Method: RA-NeRF combines NeRF scene reconstruction, flow-driven pose regulation for initialization, and an implicit pose filter to manage camera movement patterns and reduce noise.

Result: RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation and visual quality on the Tanks & Temple and NeRFBuster datasets.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF effectively handles complex camera trajectories, enhancing robustness and accuracy in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

*Chenxi Zhang,Jiayun Wu,Qing Zhang,Yazhe Zhai,Youwei Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RetroMem, a novel architecture for camouflaged object detection (COD) that incorporates historical knowledge to improve pattern inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current COD techniques lack mechanisms to utilize historical context, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenes.

Method: RetroMem utilizes a two-stage training approach: (1) Learning stage with a Dense Multi-scale Adapter (DMA) to capture multi-scale visual information, and (2) Recall stage with Dynamic Memory Mechanism (DMM) and Inference Pattern Reconstruction (IPR) for integrating historical knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show RetroMem significantly outperforms existing COD methods on widely-used datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating historical knowledge through RetroMem enhances camouflage scene understanding, marking a leap forward in COD research.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Validation on real-world data shows the proposed DA methods, particularly DBACS, improve performance in semiconductor defect classification, proving their efficacy.

Conclusion: Domain Adaptation, enhanced with the proposed DBACS model, is effective in reducing manual effort and improving defect classification in semiconductor applications, enabling advancements in Industry 4.0 and 5.0 contexts.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for the semiconductor field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSNeRV, a new framework addressing the shortcomings of implicit neural representations (INRs) for video compression by enabling better handling of detail-intensive and fast-changing video content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INR-based video compression methods struggle with highly detailed and rapidly changing video content due to underutilization of network features and lack of video-specific design considerations.

Method: The paper proposes MSNeRV, which enhances temporal consistency using temporal windows, employs Group of Pictures (GoPs) for background, integrates multi-resolution information via a spatial decoder, and introduces a multi-scale feature block to leverage hidden features.

Result: MSNeRV demonstrates superior representation capability compared to other INR-based methods and improves compression efficiency, surpassing the state-of-the-art VTM-23.7 codec in dynamic scenarios on the HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets.

Conclusion: MSNeRV effectively addresses the challenges of INR-based video compression methods, establishing itself as a robust framework with superior performance for dynamic video scenarios.

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7 (Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BCRNet, a framework designed to improve curvilinear anatomical landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery via Bezier curve refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of identifying anatomical landmarks during laparoscopic liver surgeries to enhance AR-based surgical navigation.

Method: BCRNet employs multi-modal feature extraction, adaptive Bezier curve initialization, and hierarchical curve refinement to achieve precise detection of anatomical landmarks.

Result: BCRNet outperformed state-of-the-art methods in evaluations on L3D and P2ILF datasets, showing significant improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed BCRNet framework offers a robust and effective solution for Bezier curve refinement, making it valuable for AR-based laparoscopic surgeries.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations on the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code will be available.

*Xingrui Qin,Wentao Zhao,Chuan Cao,Yihe Niu,Houcheng Jiang,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaCalNet introduces a novel framework for metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar. It reduces the need for dense LiDAR supervision to approximately 1%, achieving superior performance with sparse LiDAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce the high cost and data intensity associated with dense LiDAR supervision in metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar.

Method: RaCalNet refines sparse radar points into accurate depth priors for anchoring monocular depth prediction. This eliminates reliance on dense LiDAR labels and emphasizes structural consistency and detailed preservation.

Result: RaCalNet outperforms state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, achieving an RMSE reduction of 35.30% and 34.89% on benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: RaCalNet offers an efficient and effective alternative to dense LiDAR supervision, enabling high-quality depth estimation with sparse supervision and notable performance improvements.

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-4DRadarCam dataset and real-world deployment scenarios demonstrate its effectiveness, reducing RMSE by 35.30% and 34.89%, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper develops a benchmark in the Habitat simulator to test memory and reasoning in embodied tasks over long periods, addressing limitations of current large vision-language models in memory and action-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of large vision-language models in handling long-term memory and fine-grained reasoning in embodied robotic tasks, such as navigation and object manipulation.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark in the Habitat simulator focusing on 60 memory-based embodied tasks, which can be procedurally extended. They evaluate baseline methods combining vision-language models with low-level navigation policies.

Result: The baseline models revealed weaknesses in integrating long-term memory with real-time action, providing insights into enhancing memory and reasoning efficiency in embodied agents.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for more robust models capable of leveraging historical information for reasoning and action, demonstrating the benchmark's importance for future research on long-term control in robotics.

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement.

Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in traditional micro-expression (ME) analysis, which often treats spotting and recognition as separate tasks, and to explore the potential of leveraging multimodal reasoning abilities of large language and vision-language models.

Method: Two tasks are introduced: ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR) for a unified sequential pipeline for ME analysis, and ME visual question answering (ME-VQA) for understanding MEs through visual question-answering using multimodal large models.

Result: The MEGC 2025 establishes a leaderboard for algorithm evaluation based on the test set, allowing participants to showcase the effectiveness of their techniques.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities into ME analysis could significantly enhance the precision and utility of spotting and understanding micro-expressions.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

TL;DR: OpenPath proposes an advanced active learning technique for pathology image classification, addressing open-set scenarios with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve active learning in pathology image classification under real-world open-set scenarios with abundant unlabeled data, including Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples.

Method: The OpenPath approach integrates a Vision-Language Model for task-specific prompts during the first query and employs Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) methods, such as Prototype-based ID Selection and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling, to refine subsequent query selections.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate enhanced model performance and superiority of OpenPath over state-of-the-art open-set active learning methods due to better purity in sample selection.

Conclusion: OpenPath effectively reduces annotation costs and improves pathology image classification accuracy, showcasing its capability to handle practical open-set challenges.

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional re-identification methods struggle with the geometric distortions caused by animals' body movements and posture changes, especially for species with unique, highly deformable fur patterns.

Method: The authors propose a novel texture mapping approach that unwarps fur patterns into a canonical UV space using surface normal estimation to preserve geometric consistency between 3D surfaces and 2D texture space. This approach is self-supervised and does not require ground truth UV annotations.

Result: The framework showed up to 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy for datasets of Saimaa ringed seals and leopards across various poses and angles.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware method enhances the robustness of re-identification techniques for animals with complex fur or skin patterns, proving its utility for diverse and challenging datasets.

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space, enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDIS, which uses a diffusion model with domain alignment and class alignment to improve image synthesis in data-free contexts, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) methods fail to accurately mimic training data distributions due to the absence of prior knowledge about natural images.

Method: The proposed DDIS method employs a text-to-image diffusion model, guided by Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) and a Class Alignment Token (CAT), to generate images that closely align with the training data distribution.

Result: Experiments on PACS and ImageNet datasets show that DDIS surpasses prior DFIS approaches by achieving higher fidelity in synthetic images that align better with training data distribution.

Conclusion: DDIS demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging diffusion models and alignment strategies for data-free image synthesis, setting a new standard in quality and application potential.

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications, but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications.

Motivation: The primary motivation is to improve reliability in deep learning for medical imaging by enhancing the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which is crucial for diagnostic accuracy and anomaly identification.

Method: The approach, NERO, clusters neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution class to form centroids, introduces a relevance distance metric, scales the relevance in the bias term, and incorporates feature norms for better OOD detection.

Result: NERO outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, showing improved reliability and explainability on the gastrointestinal imaging datasets Kvasir and GastroVision.

Conclusion: NERO offers a novel, explainable, and effective approach to OOD detection, addressing gaps in feature and logit space representation methods, and holds significant promise for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods.

Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in text-driven 4D human-object interaction synthesis caused by the scarcity of large-scale HOI datasets.

Method: The two-stage framework involves Object-AnchorNet for sparse keyframe reconstruction and Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) for generating dense 4D HOI sequences with human-object interaction patterns.

Result: Experimental evaluations show state-of-the-art performance on OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong capabilities in generalizing to unseen objects and producing high-quality 4D HOI sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed GenHOI framework effectively addresses the challenges in 4D HOI synthesis by utilizing sparse keyframes and introducing human-object contact patterns into diffusion models.

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models. Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAIM, a framework for myocardial scar segmentation in cardiac MRI using realistic and diverse synthetic scar images generated via clinical knowledge-guided diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve myocardial scar segmentation models in LGE cardiac MRI by addressing the challenges of limited availability and variability of high-quality labeled data.

Method: CLAIM combines a diffusion-based generator conditioned by clinical knowledge to generate realistic scar patterns, and a joint training approach to optimize both scar generation and segmentation.

Result: CLAIM generates anatomically consistent scar patterns and achieves superior segmentation accuracy (e.g., higher Dice similarity compared to baselines).

Conclusion: CLAIM demonstrates significant potential for enhancing myocardial scar segmentation and can facilitate downstream cardiac imaging tasks through controllable and realistic scar synthesis.

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this, we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE \textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module (Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WinWinLay, a novel training-free method that addresses issues of imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts in Layout-to-Image generation using pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Layout-to-Image generation with pre-trained models suffer from imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts, warranting an innovative approach to improve control precision and realism.

Method: The paper proposes two strategies: (1) Non-local Attention Energy Function to redistribute attention scores and conform objects to spatial constraints and (2) Adaptive Update using Langevin dynamics for in-domain updates while respecting layout constraints.

Result: Experiments show WinWinLay surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of element placement control and photorealistic visual fidelity.

Conclusion: WinWinLay offers significant improvements in precision and realism for Layout-to-Image generation, making it a robust alternative to current approaches.

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m resolution imagery that performs better with less reliance on annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of high-resolution land cover classification while reducing dependency on costly pixel-level annotations.

Method: Developed a semi-supervised segmentation framework with SAM2 and FreqWeaver Adapter, focusing on parameter efficiency and leveraging unlabeled data.

Result: Achieved a 1.78% improvement over parameter-efficient strategies and 3.44% over state-of-the-art remote sensing segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The framework achieves fine-grained segmentation with minimal parameters, significantly outperforming alternatives while reducing annotation dependency.

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on 1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery, which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing segmentation approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable, graph-based approach for estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) using large-scale point clouds, overcoming limitations of current methods that require high-quality data or extensive preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of non-destructive AGB estimation, particularly the limitations of existing Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) methods which are labor-intensive, designed for single trees, and require high-quality terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data.

Method: The proposed method uses a novel graph-based pipeline to integrate tree segmentation, leaf-wood separation, and 3D skeletal reconstruction. The approach is designed for end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds with minimal preprocessing.

Result: The framework performed well even under challenging conditions, with a ~20% error rate in leaf-on conditions and ~30% in low-density UAV-based laser scanning (ULS) datasets. It demonstrates robustness and feasibility for operational-scale AGB estimation.

Conclusion: The study establishes a scalable, end-to-end solution for QSM-based AGB estimation, significantly reducing preprocessing dependencies while validating ULS as a practical alternative to TLS for forest inventory and climate change research.

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DLoRAL, a method integrating Dual LoRA Learning with stable diffusion for real-world video super-resolution, improving both spatial details and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of achieving rich spatial details and consistent temporal coherence in video super-resolution by leveraging pre-trained generative models like stable diffusion.

Method: The proposed method, DLoRAL, includes a Dual LoRA Learning paradigm with two key components: a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module for aggregating cross-frame information and two LoRA branches (Consistency-LoRA and Detail-LoRA) trained alternately for optimal performance.

Result: DLoRAL demonstrates strong performance in restoring videos with enhanced spatial details, improved temporal consistency, and efficient processing speed, as validated by experiments.

Conclusion: The DLoRAL framework overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by iteratively aligning spatial and temporal features, making it effective for high-quality and real-time video super-resolution.

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes M2M-Reg, a novel framework for multi-modal image registration (DIR), targeting modalities like PET and MRI that are difficult for traditional approaches to align.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional unsupervised DIR methods face challenges due to the extreme heterogeneity of multi-modal medical imaging modalities, often leading to unreliable mappings and image distortions.

Method: M2M-Reg uses mono-modal similarity metrics to train multi-modal DIR models and incorporates a new regularizer, GradCyCon, for diffeomorphism preservation. It also supports a semi-supervised extension that doesn't require ground-truth transformations.

Result: The proposed M2M-Reg framework achieves up to 2x higher DSC compared to previous methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration on the ADNI dataset.

Conclusion: M2M-Reg is an effective and adaptable framework for handling challenging multi-modal DIR tasks, offering superior performance and compatibility with existing architectures.

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a memory-efficient, real-time framework for open-vocabulary 3D object detection using RGB-D video without relying on dense point cloud reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for open-vocabulary 3D object detection are computationally heavy due to their dependence on dense point cloud reconstruction, limiting real-time deployment.

Method: The framework uses Cubify Anything (a visual foundation model) with CLIP for open-vocabulary 3D object detection from RGB-D video. Multi-view bounding boxes are fused using modules for 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), correspondence matching, and optimization via particle filtering.

Result: Experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets show state-of-the-art performance among online detection methods, with great generalization across large-scale environments.

Conclusion: The proposed reconstruction-free framework is memory-efficient, scalable for large environments, and enables real-time 3D object detection with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi is a framework for synthesizing realistic human-object interactions using a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating human-object interactions that balance realism and physical accuracy.

Method: The paper introduces Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO) to optimize a pretrained diffusion model in a two-phase approach: object-centric for hand-object contact and human-centric for motion refinement.

Result: HOIDiNi surpasses prior approaches on the GRAB dataset in contact accuracy, physical correctness, and overall quality.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates HOIDiNi's ability to produce complex, text-driven interactions through a structured, effective method.

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint.

### [132] [Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645)
*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reveals that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) sometimes perform better with degraded or stylistically shifted visual inputs and proposes a novel adaptation method (VQ-TTT) to enhance performance by dynamically adjusting image inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the paradox of how higher perceptual quality of images does not always lead to better performance in MLLMs, challenging the assumption that clearer visual inputs benefit these models.

Method: The authors systematically degrade and alter images across benchmarks and introduce VQ-TTT, a lightweight adaptation module that dynamically adjusts visual inputs to better align with MLLM preferences through a low-rank kernel insertion and shallow vision-encoder layer fine-tuning.

Result: The study found that MLLM performance on tasks and datasets improved with visual inputs adjusted using VQ-TTT, achieving higher accuracy without additional training data or external models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adaptive adjustments to visual inputs are crucial for optimizing MLLM performance, shifting the focus from static high-quality visuals to task-specific image optimization.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ViMaR, a two-stage framework that enhances efficiency and output quality in vision-language models by refining weak segments and applying a margin-based penalty. It achieves over 4x speedup and improved accuracy across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language model inference methods are both computationally expensive and prone to low-confidence errors, leading to hallucinations.

Method: ViMaR uses a two-stage inference strategy: selecting high-value captions in the first stage and refining weakly grounded segments in the second. A margin-based penalty reduces low-confidence outputs.

Result: ViMaR boosts caption reliability, accuracy, and explanation quality, while achieving over 4x speedup. Its cross-model generalization is demonstrated through unseen model applications, highlighting its flexibility.

Conclusion: ViMaR is an efficient, scalable, and transferable inference framework that improves caption quality and enables better vision-language model performance, paving the way for self-improving pipelines.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving VLM pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a video diffusion model-based method for single pass joint albedo estimation and relighting, overcoming limitations of data scarcity and error accumulation in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data in relighting tasks and overcoming issues with error accumulation in two-stage pipelines.

Method: Developing a generative video diffusion model that simultaneously estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass.

Result: The model trained on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates strong generalization across various domains, surpassing previous methods in visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The approach improves implicit scene understanding and facilitates realistic lighting and material effects, paving the way for advancements in image/video relighting.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation datasets have limitations such as short durations, limited locations, static scenes, and lack of exploration annotations, which hinder progress in interactive world exploration.

Method: The authors created Sekai, a worldwide video dataset consisting of 5,000+ hours of annotated FPV and UAV videos, collected through an efficient toolbox for processing and tagging with details like location and weather.

Result: Experiments validate the dataset's high quality. A subset of Sekai was used to train an interactive exploration model called YUME, showcasing its application potential.

Conclusion: Sekai is positioned to advance video generation and world exploration research, encouraging diverse applications in related fields.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes, and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location, scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECAD, a genetic algorithm designed to optimize inference speedups for diffusion-based image generation models while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow and computationally intensive inference in diffusion-based image generation models and overcome the limitations of heuristic-based feature reuse methods.

Method: The authors propose ECAD, a genetic algorithm that learns optimized caching schedules specific to each model using calibration prompts. It requires no network parameter changes and can balance quality and latency for various diffusion models.

Result: ECAD achieves significant speedups and superior performance compared to previous methods. For instance, on PixArt-alpha, it improves COCO FID by 4.47 while increasing inference speedup to 2.58x. It also generalizes well across resolutions and model variants.

Conclusion: ECAD is a scalable, generalizable solution to accelerate diffusion inference, offering notable quality-latency trade-offs while adapting effectively across diverse models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference.

### [137] [Cost-Efficient Serving of LLM Agents via Test-Time Plan Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14852)
*Qizheng Zhang,Michael Wornow,Kunle Olukotun*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces agentic plan caching, a cost-saving method for LLM-based applications that adapt and reuse structured plan templates, reducing operational expenses while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM caching methods fail to address the cost and complexity challenges in agentic applications that depend on external data and evolving contexts.

Method: Agentic plan caching extracts, stores, and adapts structured plan templates from past tasks using keyword extraction and lightweight models to tailor them to new tasks.

Result: Tests on real-world applications show a 46.62% cost reduction on average without degrading agent performance.

Conclusion: Agentic plan caching offers an effective, efficient solution for optimizing the cost and performance of LLM-based agentic applications, complementing existing infrastructures.

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hermes, a system that uses Probabilistic Demand Graphs (PDGraph) to enhance the efficiency of serving LLM applications, achieving significant reductions in completion times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve end-to-end efficiency for serving LLM applications, as existing systems fail due to improper queuing and backend latency issues.

Method: The authors developed Hermes, which utilizes PDGraph for modeling resource demands and applies the Gittins policy for optimized task scheduling and efficient backend warming.

Result: Hermes demonstrated a reduction of over 70% in average application completion time and over 80% in P95 completion time during experiments.

Conclusion: The research concludes that leveraging probabilistic modeling and tailored scheduling policies significantly boosts the efficiency of LLM application serving.

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

*Hailiang Zhang,Dieu My T. Nguyen,Christine Smit,Mahabal Hegde*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to speed up massive geospatial data computations through supplementary datasets, achieving significant performance improvements in cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale geospatial data analysis is computationally intensive, particularly in distributed or cloud environments, where full scans of data are costly and time-consuming.

Method: The authors introduce a size-tunable supplementary dataset storing cumulative sums on subsets of dimensions, which facilitates rapid computations when paired with raw data.

Result: Benchmark tests in AWS showed the method to be ~10,000 times faster than traditional approaches, using only 5% additional storage and reducing costs.

Conclusion: The method is an effective solution for scalable, high-performance geospatial data analysis, particularly for chunked and cloud-optimized data formats, with wide applicability in cloud environments.

Abstract: Data analysis on massive multi-dimensional data, such as high-resolution large-region time averaging or area averaging for geospatial data, often involves calculations over a significant number of data points. While performing calculations in scalable and flexible distributed or cloud environments is a viable option, a full scan of large data volumes still serves as a computationally intensive bottleneck, leading to significant cost. This paper introduces a generic and comprehensive method to address these computational challenges. This method generates a small, size-tunable supplementary dataset that stores the cumulative sums along specific subset dimensions on top of the raw data. This minor addition unlocks rapid and cheap high-resolution large-region data analysis, making calculations over large numbers of data points feasible with small instances or even microservices in the cloud. This method is general-purpose, but is particularly well-suited for data stored in chunked, cloud-optimized formats and for services running in distributed or cloud environments. We present a Zarr extension proposal to integrate the specifications of this method and facilitate its straightforward implementation in general-purpose software applications. Benchmark tests demonstrate that this method, implemented in Amazon Web services (AWS), significantly outperforms the brute-force approach used in on-premises services. With just 5% supplemental storage, this method achieves a performance that is 3-4 orders of magnitude (~10,000 times) faster than the brute-force approach, while incurring significantly reduced computational costs.

*Youjia Li,Robert Latham,Robert Ross,Ankit Agrawal,Alok Choudhary,Wei-Keng Liao*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable file header design for high-level I/O libraries to address inefficiencies in collective metadata updates, achieving up to 582x performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current I/O libraries are inefficient for metadata handling in large-scale applications requiring independent and parallel creation of diverse data objects.

Method: A new file header format is proposed, consisting of an index table and metadata blocks, enabling independent metadata updates while compatible with netCDF format.

Result: The new design accelerates data object creation to 582x on 4096 MPI processes and reduces memory usage inversely proportional to process count.

Conclusion: The file header innovation significantly improves scalability and efficiency in parallel I/O operations for diverse scientific applications.

Abstract: High-level I/O libraries, such as HDF5 and PnetCDF, are commonly used by large-scale scientific applications to perform I/O tasks in parallel. These I/O libraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with the raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for concurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large number of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects independently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data object creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes. Applications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle collision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different sizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects. For such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object creation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check increases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes. To address this limitation, using PnetCDF as an experimental platform, we investigate solutions in this paper that abide the netCDF file format, as well as propose a new file header format that enables independent data object creation. The proposed file header consists of two sections, an index table and a list of metadata blocks. The index table contains the reference to the metadata blocks and each block stores metadata of objects that can be created collectively or independently. The new design achieves a scalable performance, cutting data object creation times by up to 582x when running on 4096 MPI processes to create 5,684,800 data objects in parallel. Additionally, the new method reduces the memory footprints, with each process requiring an amount of memory space inversely proportional to the number of processes.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces eLLM, a memory management framework for large language models aimed at improving memory efficiency and throughput using virtual tensor abstractions and dynamic memory adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses inefficiencies in modern large language model serving systems caused by the separation of runtime memory management and key-value (KV) cache handling, which can drop throughput by almost 20%.

Method: The authors propose a framework called eLLM that uses a Virtual Tensor Abstraction to decouple memory spaces, an Elastic Memory Mechanism to dynamically adjust memory allocation between GPUs and CPUs, and a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy to meet performance constraints.

Result: eLLM demonstrates superior performance with up to 2.32x higher decoding throughput and supports 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: By integrating runtime memory and KV cache management, eLLM enhances efficiency under dynamic workloads, providing a scalable solution for deploying large language models in datacenters.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.
  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of RISC-V accelerators in the HPC domain, capitalizing on their open-standard specialization without requiring major ecosystem changes.

Method: Porting the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V accelerator while applying optimization techniques to address data movement bottlenecks.

Result: The Wormhole n300 is slower than a Xeon Platinum CPU for a 2D FFT but uses around 8 times less power and 2.8 times less energy.

Conclusion: RISC-V accelerators like the Wormhole demonstrate significant energy efficiency benefits for HPC tasks, although at the cost of performance compared to high-end CPUs.

Abstract: Whilst numerous areas of computing have adopted the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) wholesale in recent years, it is yet to become widespread in HPC. RISC-V accelerators offer a compelling option where the HPC community can benefit from the specialisation offered by the open nature of the standard but without the extensive ecosystem changes required when adopting RISC-V CPUs. In this paper we explore porting the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to the Tenstorrent Wormhole PCIe RISC-V based accelerator. Built upon Tenstorrent's Tensix architecture, this technology decouples the movement of data from compute, potentially offering increased control to the programmer. Exploring different optimisation techniques to address the bottlenecks inherent in data movement, we demonstrate that for a 2D FFT whilst the Wormhole n300 is slower than a server-grade 24-core Xeon Platinum CPU, the Wormhole draws around 8 times less power and consumes around 2.8 times less energy than the CPU when computing the Fourier transform.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help developers select optimal parallel programming models for modern heterogeneous HPC architectures.

Method: Systematic analysis of MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA across architecture, performance, domain suitability, programming complexity, and advancements, supplemented with performance evaluations across various applications.

Result: MPI excels in distributed memory with scalability but has communication overhead, OpenMP is strong for shared memory with usability but faces contention, and CUDA performs well on GPUs but requires NVIDIA hardware and expertise. Hybrid approaches often perform best in heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: The optimal programming model depends on application requirements, hardware, and constraints, with hybrid methods frequently delivering superior performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three dominant parallel programming models in High Performance Computing (HPC): Message Passing Interface (MPI), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern heterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We systematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural foundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability, programming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's strengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation demonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with near-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces communication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and usability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited by shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for data-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires specialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations, machine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining two or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments. The paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best practices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks, task-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data. This research helps developers and researchers make informed decisions when selecting programming models for modern HPC applications, emphasizing that the best choice depends on application requirements, hardware, and development constraints.

*Nikolay Blagoev,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Lydia Yiyu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces CheckFree and CheckFree+, efficient methods for training LLMs on decentralized nodes to handle failures without additional storage or computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the cost and democratize model training on decentralized nodes while addressing the node churn and failures that impact model training stages.

Method: The method involves using CheckFree, where failed stages are substituted by weighted averages of neighboring stages, and CheckFree+, which extends this with out-of-order pipeline execution for first and last stage failures using neighbor-copying and embedding layer strategies.

Result: CheckFree and CheckFree+ were evaluated on LLaMa models with various failure rates, showing over 12% improvement in convergence in wall-clock time compared to traditional methods for low and medium failure rates.

Conclusion: CheckFree and CheckFree+ effectively address failure recovery in decentralized LLM training, outperforming existing methods and mitigating overhead while providing efficient, scalable solutions.

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization. The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates (5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our proposals can be run via our code available at: https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in data movement during parallel computations for symmetric CP decompositions and eigenpair determination of 3-dimensional symmetric tensors.

Method: The authors extend a geometric inequality to derive communication lower bounds and propose an optimal algorithm based on triangle block partitioning for symmetric matrices, adapted to 3-dimensional symmetric tensors.

Result: The derived communication lower bounds are proven tight, and the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal communication cost.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of efficient parallel computation in higher-order tensor operations by providing fundamental insights into communication costs and offering a practical algorithmic solution.

Abstract: In this article, we focus on the parallel communication cost of multiplying the same vector along two modes of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor. This is a key computation in the higher-order power method for determining eigenpairs of a $3$-dimensional symmetric tensor and in gradient-based methods for computing a symmetric CP decomposition. We establish communication lower bounds that determine how much data movement is required to perform the specified computation in parallel. The core idea of the proof relies on extending a key geometric inequality for $3$-dimensional symmetric computations. We demonstrate that the communication lower bounds are tight by presenting an optimal algorithm where the data distribution is a natural extension of the triangle block partition scheme for symmetric matrices to 3-dimensional symmetric tensors.

*Kunming Zhang,Hanlong Liao,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LiteGD, a dispatching system that optimizes GPU allocation in large-scale heterogeneous clusters using lightweight transformers and bidirectional search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in GPU allocation in large-scale, heterogeneous clusters due to irregular bandwidth distributions, and the limitations of current proximity-based GPU dispatch methods.

Method: LiteGD uses a computation-aware design with a lightweight Transformer to handle GPU topology data, coupled with a bidirectional tree search to optimize dispatching.

Result: LiteGD achieves approximately 90% bandwidth efficacy in various configurations and 80% in real-world clusters, outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: LiteGD offers a scalable and effective solution for GPU dispatching, enhancing performance in large-scale and heterogeneous GPU clusters.

Abstract: Parallel computing with multiple GPUs has become the dominant paradigm for machine learning tasks, especially those of large language models (LLMs). To reduce the latency incurred by inter-GPU communication, a common practice for parallel tasks has been to allocate GPUs based on their physical proximity. However, this long-standing assumption has notable limitations, particularly in large-scale, heterogeneous GPU clusters where bandwidth distribution among GPUs is irregular. In this paper, we introduce LiteGD, a lightweight and dynamic GPU dispatching system based on global perspectives. To tackle the difficulty of storing massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware design that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled data. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability and scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to find the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step, which can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We implement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy (approximately 90\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\% in real-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and interconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of machine learning algorithms to automatically define thresholds in Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing the performance of Anomaly Detection Systems by automating the definition of thresholds for reconstruction error classification, as current thresholds are non-trivial and non-standardized.

Method: The paper evaluates three machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, and Support Vector Machine) to automate the threshold definition in Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection Systems.

Result: The research provides insights into the suitability and performance of the three algorithms for defining thresholds in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Using machine learning models to define thresholds can optimize anomaly detection performance more effectively than manual or static methods, offering a promising improvement in the field of digital security.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

TL;DR: This paper proposes MedSyn, a collaborative framework where physicians and large language models (LLMs) engage in interactive dialogues to enhance clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision-making is complex, affected by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Current LLM usage does not fully address these realities.

Method: The proposed framework, MedSyn, facilitates multi-step dialogues between physicians and LLMs. Physicians can challenge suggestions, while LLMs provide alternative perspectives, simulating real medical interactions.

Result: Simulated interactions with open-source LLMs showed that these models are promising as physician assistants in clinical contexts.

Conclusion: MedSyn demonstrates potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions through interactive exchanges. Future work will validate its efficacy in real-world physician interactions.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

*Jiyi Wang,Jingyang Ke,Bo Dai,Anqi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SKIL, a novel method for understanding animal behaviors by modeling them as dynamic mixtures of reusable skill components, outperforming traditional discrete methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify animal behavior by using discrete syllables with restrictive assumptions, failing to address the flexible and combinatorial nature of motor primitives.

Method: The paper presents skill-based imitation learning (SKIL), a reinforcement learning-based framework that uses representation learning on transition probabilities to infer skill sets and parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills.

Result: SKIL successfully identifies reusable skill components, learns compositional policies that evolve continuously, and generates realistic trajectories in various tasks, including grid worlds, labyrinths, and videos of animals.

Conclusion: The SKIL framework provides a principled and concise way to understand complex animal behaviors, demonstrating how these emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

### [152] [Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781)
*Corentin Delacour,M Mahmudul Hasan Sajeeb,Joao P. Hespanha,Kerem Y. Camsari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) that enhances the performance of constrained Ising problems, eliminating the need for penalty tuning and ensuring constraint satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing Ising model implementations is challenging due to soft constraint issues, which hinder mixing or fail to enforce feasibility, motivating the need for better algorithms.

Method: The authors propose a novel extension to parallel tempering (PT) by adding a second dimension of replicas that interpolate penalty strengths, which ensures constraints are honored in the final replicas.

Result: In practical scenarios like graph sparsification, 2D-PT achieved optimal mixing rates (Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t)) and demonstrated significant speedup over conventional PT methods on sparsified Wishart instances.

Conclusion: The 2D-PT algorithm is broadly applicable, improves efficiency in constrained Ising problems, and can be implemented on existing hardware, making it a versatile and impactful advancement.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two AI systems, DeepSeek-V3 and NetraAI, are studied. NetraAI uniquely identifies predictive patient cohorts by merging mathematical frameworks, and its findings are enhanced by an LLM Strategist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to demonstrate a novel AI framework (NetraAI) that uses dynamical systems and interpretability to improve clinical trial outcomes on small datasets.

Method: NetraAI employs contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to construct stable predictive models. It also integrates an LLM Strategist to optimize variable selection and robustness.

Result: NetraAI identified highly predictive cohorts in case studies of schizophrenia, depression, and pancreatic cancer, turning baseline models into near-perfect classifiers.

Conclusion: NetraAI combines advanced AI techniques to create a self-reflective framework for reliable, explainable clinical discoveries, highlighting its utility in precision medicine and reasoning systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized "species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical discovery.

*Flavio Martinelli,Alexander Van Meegen,Berfin Şimşek,Wulfram Gerstner,Johanni Brea*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies slow-loss-decreasing channels in neural network landscapes, resulting in the formation of gated linear units, influencing optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structural quirks in neural network loss landscapes for better optimization insights.

Method: Analysis of gradient dynamics and geometric characterization of special channels leading to gated linear units.

Result: Neurons diverge with specific weight vector alignment, forming gated linear units, resembling quasi-flat minima.

Conclusion: These quasi-flat structures highlight unique computational aspects of fully connected layers and impact optimization behavior.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_iσ(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_jσ(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot \mathbf{x}) \rightarrow σ(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{x}) σ'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities of fully connected layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary natural language decoding from EEG remains a challenge due to noise and variability, and current models perform poorly in this scenario.

Method: The ETS framework integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to improve text decoding and sentiment classification performance.

Result: ETS achieves superior BLEU/Rouge scores for text decoding and a 10% improvement in F1 score for sentiment classification, outperforming supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The ETS framework demonstrates potential for robust, subject-independent open-vocabulary EEG-to-text systems with strong performance metrics.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1) open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HiPreNets, a progressive framework refining staged training techniques to improve deep neural network accuracy, particularly targeting $L^{\infty}$ error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus primarily on minimizing MSE in neural network training, neglecting $L^{\infty}$ error crucial to specific applications, especially as complexity increases.

Method: Employs a staged training technique to sequentially learn prediction residuals, leveraging residual structure to guide loss choice, parameter selection, and adaptive data sampling.

Result: Shows improved accuracy and precision of neural network models, validated through several benchmark problems.

Conclusion: HiPreNets enables more precise and effective tuning of neural networks, addressing challenges in optimizing both MSE and $L^{\infty}$ performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

*Emre Yilmaz,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transfer learning-based method for predicting aerodynamic parameters (angle of attack and onflow speed) using surface pressure data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, near real-time prediction models for aerodynamic parameters is motivated by practical applications in wind tunnels, flight operations, and wind energy systems, especially under circumstances like sensor faults.

Method: A convolutional neural network (ConvNet) pretrained offline for core prediction is adapted using transfer learning. This involves freezing most of the pretrained layers, retraining selected layers for new domains or tasks, and testing the model on CFD data.

Result: The method was effective for domain and task adaptation, showcasing adaptability to new data distributions and prediction tasks. However, its performance with noisy data was not as effective.

Conclusion: Transfer learning enables efficient adaptation of prediction models to new tasks and varying data distributions, although noise remains a limitation to its effectiveness.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy data is concluded to be not as effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method, PIPE, to better utilize visual data like satellite imagery for multimodal time series forecasting by embedding physics-based information into vision-language models. It achieves superior performance on forecasting tasks, especially in typhoon intensity prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing multimodal forecasting models focus on text data and neglect visual data, such as satellite imagery. Additionally, it's challenging to capture physical and geospatial-temporal context within visual data.

Method: The paper proposes PIPE, which includes (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism that embeds frequency information of physical variables and token order.

Result: PIPE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in satellite image-based forecasting tasks, achieving a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works.

Conclusion: PIPE effectively enhances multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy by preserving physical and temporal context, filling a gap in utilizing visual data for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the retrieval challenges in multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems designed for warehouses, using deep reinforcement learning combined with graph neural networks and transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency and flexibility of multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations, as traditional methods fail to address retrieval delays caused by lane blockages, thus hindering operational adaptability.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning-based framework is developed, leveraging a graph-based state representation that captures item attributes and warehouse topology. The proposed method uses a combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformers to optimize retrieval priorities and minimize tardiness.

Result: The approach outperforms heuristic methods in extensive numerical experiments, showing improved minimization of retrieval tardiness and demonstrating strong generalization across different warehouse layouts.

Conclusion: The proposed neural framework proves effective and adaptable, offering a robust solution to improve the efficiency of multi-deep storage systems under various configurations.

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.

Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.

### [163] [Continuous Evolution Pool: Taming Recurring Concept Drift in Online Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14790)
*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method, Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), is proposed to address recurring concept drift in time series by storing and retrieving forecasters for different data patterns, improving prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurring concept drift in time series causes online prediction accuracy to decline due to the forgetting of previously encountered patterns; existing methods fail to retain extensive knowledge.

Method: CEP stores instances of forecasters corresponding to various concepts, selects the closest forecaster for prediction, and evolves new models for novel concepts while eliminating outdated ones.

Result: Experiments across eight datasets and different architectures show that CEP improves prediction accuracy in online forecasting with recurring concepts.

Conclusion: CEP effectively retains knowledge of different concepts and demonstrates significant predictive improvements in recurring concept drift scenarios.

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept. Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the prediction results.

### [164] [Protein Language Model Zero-Shot Fitness Predictions are Improved by Inference-only Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14793)
*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing dropout at inference into Protein Language Models like ESM2 enhances zero-shot performance for protein fitness prediction in the ProteinGym dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the zero-shot capability of Protein Language Models (PLMs) for predicting critical protein properties such as fitness without requiring additional retraining or fine-tuning.

Method: Incorporated a dropout layer during inference between the PLM's embedding layer and its transformer, then used Monte-Carlo dropout techniques to average outputs.

Result: Demonstrated increased zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset, with a dropout rate of 0.1 being consistently effective across models.

Conclusion: Inference-stage dropout combined with Monte-Carlo averaging improves performance for PLMs like ESM2, providing a scalable enhancement without retraining.

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

### [165] [Assembly of Experts: Linear-time construction of the Chimera LLM variants with emergent and adaptable behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14794)
*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses an efficient method called "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) for creating functional child models from parent Mixture-of-Experts models in linear time, producing capable hybrid models without fine-tuning or distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of requiring extremely high FLOPs to calculate weights in large language models during pretraining, leveraging investments in pretrained models more effectively.

Method: The AoE method interpolates the weight tensors of parent Mixture-of-Experts models to create child models, enhancing or suppressing their semantic features. It involves varying the proportions of weights and does not require fine-tuning or distillation.

Result: The method produces functional child models with changing or emergent properties. A specific model, DeepSeek R1T "Chimera," was built as a hybrid of existing models and showed strong performance, similar intelligence to one parent but with increased efficiency in output generation.

Conclusion: The AoE construction method is an efficient way to explore model space and create capable hybrid models from existing ones. The generated child models display favorable traits, such as orderly reasoning and high functionality, without additional training.

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new "Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed. Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores a trade-off between structured and selective internal representations in intelligent systems, presenting theoretical and empirical analyses showing universal constraints on generalization and identification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental limitations of intelligent systems in balancing structured representations (for generalization) and selective representations (for input specificity).

Method: Developed closed-form theoretical expressions, performed analyses on noisy and heterogeneous input spaces, utilized minimal ReLU networks and deeper architectures like CNNs and vision-language models to validate findings.

Result: Achieved theoretical results showing universal Pareto fronts, demonstrated empirical consistency in diverse models, and presented insights on multi-input processing capacities and representational behavior.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that finite-resolution similarity imposes universal constraints on representational trade-offs, applicable across models, providing foundational insights into how deep networks and brains encode information.

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective -- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and brains alike.

### [167] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical analysis on the effect of vocabulary size in large language models and shows the limitations of $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) in settings with large vocabularies. It proposes a new scaling rule for embedding learning rates based on theoretical and experimental findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretraining large language models is resource-intensive. While $μP$ parameterization helps transfer hyperparameters across models of different widths, it appears to exhibit limitations, especially in scenarios with large vocabularies. This necessitates a deeper understanding of scaling rules in such contexts.

Method: The authors analyzed the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics and identified a new scaling regime (Large Vocab Regime). They proposed that in this regime, the optimal embedding-to-hidden learning rate ratio should scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$. They validated their theory with experiments, including the pretraining of a 1B parameter model from scratch.

Result: The results demonstrate that under the Large Vocab Regime, the new scaling rule for embedding learning rates performs better than the $Θ(width)$ rule predicted by $μP$. Theoretical derivations and experiments align well, confirming the usefulness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of $μP$ in large vocabulary settings and provides an alternate scaling approach that is theoretically and empirically validated. This contributes to more efficient pretraining dynamics in large language models.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR.

### [168] [Event-Driven Online Vertical Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14911)
*Ganyu Wang,Boyu Wang,Bin Gu,Charles Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an event-driven online VFL framework that addresses asynchronous data streaming challenges in real-world scenarios, improving stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in adapting online learning to Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), specifically asynchronous and event-driven data streaming scenarios overlooked in existing research.

Method: The proposed framework activates only relevant clients during event-driven data generation, with others passively collaborating. It incorporates dynamic local regret (DLR) analysis to manage complex non-convex online learning in non-stationary environments.

Result: The framework achieves better stability compared to existing online VFL solutions under non-stationary data conditions, while also significantly cutting communication and computation costs.

Conclusion: The event-driven VFL framework effectively addresses practical online learning challenges in VFL by leveraging event-driven activation and DLR, showcasing improved adaptability and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication and computation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing time-series forecasting by addressing computational limitations and interpretability challenges in Transformer-based models.

Method: Integrates semantic index embeddings, adaptive spline-based temporal encoding, and a selective state-space model framework to reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy.

Result: Experimental evaluations show superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability compared to conventional Transformer-based approaches.

Conclusion: ss-Mamba offers a computationally efficient and versatile alternative for time-series forecasting with significant advantages in performance and interpretability.

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based models in time-series forecasting.

### [170] [Muon Optimizes Under Spectral Norm Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15054)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical understanding of the Muon optimizer by associating it with the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ optimizer family and showing how Muon enforces spectral norm constraints on weight matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The theoretical underpinnings of the Muon optimizer are not well understood despite its promising empirical performance, prompting the need for rigorous analysis.

Method: The paper analyzes Muon in the context of the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers and identifies its implicit spectral norm enforcement through a specific convex mapping.

Result: It is shown that Muon can be framed as Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ with the nuclear norm, and its implicit properties and constraints are theoretically characterized.

Conclusion: The analysis clarifies the regularization effects of Muon, enabling broader generalizations and exploration of new optimization algorithms by varying the convex mapping $\mathcal{K}$. This bridges the empirical and theoretical aspects of Muon.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a continuous time approximation for the Heavy-Ball momentum method that explicitly incorporates discretization error, improving its analytical insight and application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the gap between discrete optimization dynamics and their continuous time approximations, particularly for the Heavy-Ball momentum method, by addressing the impact of discretization error.

Method: It proposes a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation with added counter terms to explicitly account for discretization error, thereby controlling the error to any desired order of step size.

Result: The authors provide a refined continuous time model for HB momentum, demonstrate its relevance through implicit regularization and bias analysis in linear networks, and validate these findings via numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This work enhances theoretical tools for analyzing optimization dynamics, specifically the Heavy-Ball method, showcasing potential applications in deep learning and beyond.

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size. As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF), integrating low-rank tensor algebra with deep learning to handle missing traffic data, achieving superior results compared to other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing pervasive missing data in traffic systems hinders accurate spatiotemporal analysis for optimizing urban mobility and infrastructure.

Method: Combines CP decomposition into neural models, using learnable embeddings and hierarchical fusion mechanisms to impute missing traffic data with high-dimensional representation.

Result: NCPF outperformed six state-of-the-art methods across six urban traffic datasets.

Conclusion: NCPF effectively merges traditional factor analysis with neural networks, enhancing spatiotemporal traffic data analysis and supporting adaptive traffic systems.

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience. However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive traffic control systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores robustness of federated learning against Byzantine behavior, providing both lower and upper bounds for centroid approximation under different validity conditions, along with a new algorithm achieving tight bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior and examine the associated tradeoffs between average/centroid and validity conditions.

Method: Analytical derivation of lower and upper bounds for centroid approximation under various validity conditions and the development of a new algorithm achieving tight approximation bounds.

Result: The establishment of the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$, an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, and a new algorithm achieving $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity.

Conclusion: The bounds and algorithm contribute to the understanding of robustness in federated learning, validated through analytical and empirical evaluations, including distributed settings.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

TL;DR: This paper examines the sensitivity of vision language models (VLMs) to prompt variations, introducing a framework called PARC to measure reliability, test robustness, and improve understanding of prompt responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine if VLMs, which integrate visual modalities with prompt-sensitive large language models (LLMs), inherit similar instabilities in response to varying prompts, thus impacting their real-world applications.

Method: The authors introduce PARC, which consists of: (1) plausible prompt variations in language and vision domains, (2) a reliability score with guarantees, and (3) a calibration mechanism for analyzing sensitivity caused by prompt variations across datasets and prompts.

Result: Key findings include: VLMs exhibit sensitivity to prompts similarly to LLMs, destructive prompt variations can change expected outcomes, robust models from the InternVL2 family perform best, and training data correlates with prompt sensitivity.

Conclusion: The paper highlights challenges in VLM prompt sensitivity, proposes a robust framework for analysis, and emphasizes the need for careful attention to training data and prompt design to enhance model reliability.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models, outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2 family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

TL;DR: The paper rigorously investigates the generalization accuracy of machine learning methods applied to solving the 1D Poisson differential equation, revealing critical insights into their limitations and proposing evaluation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning applications in scientific domains require rigorous quantitative validation to ensure accurate solutions for physical problems like differential equations.

Method: The authors analyze both white-box and black-box model performance on the 1D Poisson equation by deriving theoretical generalization bounds, convergence rates, and parameters. They validate these bounds empirically and examine various ML models.

Result: Generalization failures are observed across different ML techniques, and surprising opposing behaviors are noted between model classes. Green's functions can be extracted for interpretability, and a new cross-validation approach is presented.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the limitations in generalizing ML models for physical equations, propose the Poisson equation as a standard benchmark, and offer improved interpretability and cross-validation techniques for scientific ML applications.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary 1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

TL;DR: This study examines federated learning's (FL) effectiveness in estimating BrainAGE using stroke patient data, outperforming single-site models and linking BrainAGE to vascular risk factors and recovery outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BrainAGE is a key biomarker for brain health, yet training robust models requires large datasets often constrained by privacy concerns. The study aims to evaluate FL's potential in addressing these challenges in stroke patients.

Method: Using FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospitals, machine and deep learning models assessed BrainAGE under centralized, FL, and single-site learning strategies. Associations with vascular risk factors and functional outcomes were also analyzed.

Result: Centralized learning had the highest accuracy, but FL outperformed single-site models. Higher BrainAGE was linked to diabetes mellitus and poor post-stroke recovery. FL showed its potential for prediction with distributed data.

Conclusion: FL provides accurate BrainAGE predictions while preserving data privacy. BrainAGE's correlation with vascular risk factors and recovery reveals its value in stroke prognosis.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns. This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors, and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in stroke care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects forecasting models for sparse and intermittent demand in supply chains, improving accuracy and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent zero-demand periods in supply chains hinder traditional forecasting models, necessitating adaptive approaches to improve inventory management.

Method: The study introduces a Model-Router framework using rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers to dynamically assign forecasting models based on demand patterns.

Result: Experiments using the Favorita dataset demonstrate up to 11.8% improvement in forecasting accuracy (NWRMSLE) and a 4.67x faster inference time enabled by the InceptionTime router.

Conclusion: Adaptive AI frameworks significantly enhance forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency, benefiting supply chain management by reducing stockouts and excess inventory.

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Conclusion: The proposed modular architecture balances scalability, knowledge retention, and task performance, making it suitable for continual reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

*Simiao Lin,Wannes Meert,Pieter Robberechts,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a technique for simplifying warping paths in time series comparisons to improve visualization and interpretability, focusing on transformations like shift and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visualizations of time series focus on point-to-point alignment but fail to represent broader structural relationships, making it difficult to interpret changes such as shifts and compression between time series.

Method: The proposed method simplifies the warping path of time series to highlight and quantify key transformations, like shift, compression, and amplitude differences, enabling visualization of subsequence matches.

Result: The method provides clearer representations of structural differences and relationships between time series, enhancing interpretability for tasks like clustering and classification.

Conclusion: By focusing on structural comparisons and key transformations, this technique addresses a gap in qualitative visualization in time series analysis, complementing elastic distance measures.

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.

### [181] [LIT-LVM: Structured Regularization for Interaction Terms in Linear Predictors using Latent Variable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15492)
*Mohammadreza Nemati,Zhipeng Huang,Kevin S. Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured regularization approach (LIT-LVM) for estimating coefficients in linear predictors, particularly interaction terms, using low-dimensional latent feature representations. It achieves improved prediction accuracy compared to standard methods and aids in feature analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear predictors often struggle with properly estimating coefficients for interaction terms in high-dimensional settings due to overfitting and other challenges.

Method: The paper uses low-dimensional latent vectors to represent features for creating interaction terms, incorporating structured regularization to avoid overfitting. This approach extends beyond standard methods like lasso and elastic net.

Result: LIT-LVM outperforms elastic net and factorization machines in terms of prediction accuracy, especially in scenarios with a large number of interaction terms relative to samples. It also offers a tool for visualizing feature relationships.

Conclusion: The proposed LIT-LVM method enhances prediction accuracy and provides insightful latent representations, making it a robust choice for modeling interaction terms in challenging high-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

*Gyaneshwar Agrahari,Kiran Bist,Monika Pandey,Jacob Kapita,Zachary James,Jackson Knox,Steven Heymsfield,Sophia Ramirez,Peter Wolenski,Nadejda Drenska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores an alternative to costly DXA scans for predicting body composition metrics using a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model applied to biomarkers from 3D optical images, achieving promising error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anthropometric methods like DXA scans are expensive and time-intensive, necessitating the development of cost-effective and faster alternatives for early disease diagnosis involving body composition metrics.

Method: The paper utilizes statistical and supervised machine learning models alongside a semi-supervised $p$-Laplacian regression model on biomarker data sourced from 847 patients. The biomarker data was derived from 3D optical images.

Result: The $p$-Laplacian model showed errors of ~13% for ALM, ~10% for BMD, and ~20% for BFP with limited (~10%) training data. SVR and LS-SVR performed best under supervised settings, demonstrating lower error rates.

Conclusion: The $p$-Laplacian regression model is effective for predicting body composition variables in data-constrained environments, offering a viable alternative to DXA scans.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases. Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM, $\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications, particularly in a data-constrained environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper simplifies understanding of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in linear regression, recovering existing results using straightforward tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make the analysis of SGD, particularly in the context of linear regression, more accessible and intuitive without relying on complex mathematical techniques involving positive semi-definite matrices.

Method: The authors use simplified linear algebra tools to rederive bias and variance bounds for SGD in linear regression, avoiding the manipulation of positive semi-definite matrices.

Result: The analysis successfully recovers the same bias and variance bounds as the referenced prior work, demonstrating the validity of the simplified approach.

Conclusion: The simplified analysis can make SGD more comprehensible and facilitate further studies on mini-batching and learning rate scheduling in training models.

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools, bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the training of realistic models.

*Sunil Kumar,Bowen Zhao,Leo Dirac,Paulina Varshavskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a method called GRPO to enhance smaller vision-language models by incorporating external tools, achieving better performance in visual question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often underperform in detailed visual reasoning, particularly when computational resources are constrained.

Method: The authors train smaller models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) combined with a simplified tool-calling interface, additional tokens for external tool results, and a data mix emphasizing visually challenging examples.

Result: The approach improves performance in visual question-answering tasks when compared to baseline models of similar size.

Conclusion: Incorporating external tools and the GRPO training method enables smaller models to excel in detailed visual reasoning, making them more effective while remaining resource-efficient.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano is a Federated Learning framework developed to overcome the challenges of deploying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in decentralized scenarios with strict privacy requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges of deploying large-scale MLLMs in real-world scenarios, such as high computational demands and storage constraints on clients, motivated the development of FedNano.

Method: FedNano introduces NanoEdge at client ends utilizing lightweight modules, including modality-specific encoders, connectors, and NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation, while centralizing the LLM at the server.

Result: FedNano reduces client-side storage by 95% and communication overhead to 0.01% of model parameters, outperforming prior FL baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: FedNano bridges the scalability gap between MLLMs and FL feasibility, making decentralized multimodal AI systems practical.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: Surrogate models like Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) excel in predicting correlated properties of high-entropy alloys by managing uncertainty and data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to streamline material design and optimization by evaluating advanced surrogate models for predicting correlated properties in high-entropy alloys, integrating computational and experimental data.

Method: Four surrogate models—cGP, DGP, encoder-decoder neural networks, and XGBoost—are applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational material properties in an AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. Their prediction performance is assessed.

Result: DGP models infused with machine learning-based priors outperform other surrogates in handling inter-property correlations, heteroscedasticity, and incomplete data, offering higher predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) prove to be robust tools in achieving data-efficient and accurate materials design, outperforming other surrogate approaches for HEA property prediction.

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations. This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics. Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparency and data limitations in machine learning, particularly in healthcare and AMD diagnosis, motivated the need for an interpretable and effective solution for data classification.

Method: The paper introduces CACTUS, a classification tool that integrates genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic features, while prioritizing explainability and flexibility.

Result: CACTUS outperformed standard ML models in AMD classification and helped identify key medical factors, enabling the creation of a clinical scenario for feedback and bias correction.

Conclusion: CACTUS enhances decision-making in AMD diagnosis by providing explainable results and addressing biases, underscoring its utility in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use. In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

*Jenni Raitoharju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach called Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for improving One-class SVM performance, particularly in small-scale classification with limited negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance one-class classification methods when only limited negative samples are available, as current models often perform suboptimally in this setting.

Method: The method involves using GRKneg, which adapts the kernel in OC-SVM utilizing the available negative samples without altering the original OC-SVM optimization process.

Result: The proposed method outperforms standard OC-SVM with a Radial Basis Function kernel and surpasses binary SVM methods when the number of negative samples is very low.

Conclusion: GRKneg effectively bridges the gap between one-class and binary SVM classification, offering a robust solution for scenarios with minimal negative samples.

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms the binary SVM.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedOne, a framework for efficiently tuning discrete prompts in federated black-box settings with cloud-based LLMs, improving query efficiency through theoretical and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high query costs in federated black-box prompt tuning with cloud-based LLMs, leveraging data from diverse sources while minimizing costs.

Method: The authors degraded FedAvg by using a one-client-per-round strategy (FedOne) and performed theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to ensure query efficiency.

Result: The FedOne framework demonstrated significant improvements in query efficiency, validated both theoretically and through experiments.

Conclusion: FedOne is an effective solution for federated black-box discrete prompt learning, offering optimal query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs.

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne}, enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning. Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the challenge of extending RL in LLMs beyond narrow domains like math and code by providing diverse and reliable reward signals.

Method: The researchers constructed the Guru dataset with domain-specific reward designs for six reasoning domains, filtered for quality. RL training was applied systematically to examine domain behavior and model improvement.

Result: Guru-7B and Guru-32B models demonstrated superior reasoning performance across six domains, particularly on tasks outside routine pretraining content. They surpassed baseline models by 7.9% and 6.7%.

Conclusion: RL shows potential for skill acquisition in less-exposed domains, with curated datasets like Guru enabling development of general-purpose reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining data.

*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of reliably estimating ML model error under distribution shifts by improving upon the existing disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) approach, proposing a new method called Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting error in unseen test domains is critical for ensuring the performance and safety of ML models in real-world scenarios, especially under distribution shifts.

Method: The authors identify a limitation in the DIS^2 method involving competition in overlapping source and target domains, and propose the ODD approach which focuses disagreement only in the non-overlapping domain. They utilize domain-classifiers to estimate domain overlap for better prediction.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks showed that ODD improves the accuracy of performance-estimation error compared to DIS^2, while maintaining validity and reliability.

Conclusion: ODD provides a more accurate and reliable framework for estimating ML model errors under distribution shifts, addressing limitations in prior approaches through overlap-aware adjustments.

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: This paper investigates hallucinations in embodied agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on why and how such hallucinations occur during navigation tasks with inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the issue of inherited hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents, especially in scenarios where user instructions conflict with the physical environment.

Method: The authors designed a hallucination probing set to induce high hallucination rates and tested 12 LLM models across two simulation environments to examine their handling of scene-task inconsistencies.

Result: The study revealed that while the models demonstrate reasoning capabilities, they generally fail to resolve inconsistencies, leading to errors in executing infeasible tasks.

Conclusion: The findings indicate critical limitations in current LLMs regarding grounding instructions into physical environments, and the authors provide insights for improving planning strategies in future models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.

### [193] [Early Prediction of Multiple Sclerosis Disability Progression via Multimodal Foundation Model Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14986)
*Maxime Usdin,Lito Kriara,Licinio Craveiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how combining clinical data and advanced digital data through foundation models and multimodal approaches improves the prediction of disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of disability in MS is difficult due to the disease's heterogeneity, necessitating novel methods to improve prognostics.

Method: The study utilized state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models, a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and other machine learning techniques on clinical and daily digital data from a clinical trial.

Result: Integrating digital data via foundation models enhanced prediction accuracy, with the multimodal transformer consistently outperforming unimodal models.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches leveraging foundation models show promise for extracting predictive signals from diverse clinical and digital data, advancing accurate prognostics for MS and similar complex diseases.

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework that ensures fairness while optimizing system performance, utilizing a novel probing technique for information gathering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a fair yet efficient decision-making framework in multi-agent systems with limited information drives this research.

Method: The authors propose a probing framework: a greedy probing algorithm for offline settings leveraging submodular properties, and an online algorithm achieving sublinear regret with fairness.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance in fairness and efficiency compared to baseline methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances fairness and system efficiency, making it a promising solution for multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

### [195] [Stable CDE Autoencoders with Acuity Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Sepsis Treatment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15019)
*Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the instability issue in learning state representations for reinforcement learning in sepsis treatment using ICU time series, proposing Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) with stabilization and acuity-awareness methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for sepsis treatment requires stable, clinically-relevant state representations from ICU data, yet training instability hampers policy performance.

Method: The authors used Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) autoencoders, stabilized through early stopping or stabilization techniques, and applied correlation regularization with clinical acuity scores to enhance representational quality.

Result: Stable CDE representations correlated strongly with clinical scores and enabled superior RL policies (WIS return > 0.9), while unstable representations resulted in poor policies (WIS return ~ 0), as demonstrated in experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset.

Conclusion: Stable CDEs are critical for accurate state representation and successful RL in clinical settings; instability must be addressed for meaningful trajectories and robust policies.

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim,Sumiran Singh Thakur,Su Min Park,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT-GO improves supervised fine-tuning by grouping tokens by importance and optimizing LLMs with a focus on the most challenging groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning methods treat all tokens equally, overlooking the importance of critical, task-specific tokens.

Method: SFT-GO introduces token importance grouping and optimizes learning with a weighted combination of worst-group loss and standard cross-entropy loss.

Result: Models trained with SFT-GO outperform baselines on LLM benchmarks, showing consistent and robust improvements.

Conclusion: SFT-GO enhances learning dynamics by emphasizing challenging token groups, proving to be an effective and efficient fine-tuning strategy.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for hyperparameter optimization using Sequential Policy Gradient (SPG), achieving improved model performance and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of high time and computational costs in conventional neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization methods.

Method: Proposal of Sequential Policy Gradient (SPG), a model designed to generate state-action trajectories in a single forward pass using temporary modules.

Result: SPG demonstrated consistent performance improvements (+0.2~7%) across various datasets (ImageNet, COCO, GLUE, SQuAD, SUPERB) while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: SPG is an effective and efficient approach for hyperparameter optimization, proving its industrial applicability and broad adaptability to different data domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3 multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$, with significantly low computational costs.

*Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Wei Lu,Yan Shen,Dongxu Li,Peijin Guo,Ziqi Zhou,Minghui Li,Yanjun Zhang,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper surveys verification methods for machine unlearning, introducing a two-part taxonomy and identifying challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for privacy and compliance (e.g., GDPR) has heightened the need for effective machine unlearning verification.

Method: The authors provided a detailed survey, proposing a taxonomy with two main verification categories: behavioral and parametric.

Result: Representative methods within these categories were analyzed, shedding light on assumptions, strengths, limitations, and vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: A set of open problems was presented to guide future research into more robust unlearning verification techniques.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance (e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category, analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded unlearning verification mechanisms.

*Bing Liu,Chengcheng Zhao,Li Chai,Peng Cheng,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ImprovDML, a decentralized framework for distributed machine learning that addresses both Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage while maintaining high model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning without compromising model accuracy.

Method: The framework combines resilient vector consensus algorithms for aggregation and adds multivariate Gaussian noise to gradients for privacy preservation. Also, it uses concentrated geo-privacy for privacy metrics.

Result: ImprovDML offers better privacy-accuracy trade-off and tighter learning error bounds under non-convex settings. Numerical simulations support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: ImprovDML successfully ensures resilience to attacks and privacy preservation without significant accuracy compromise, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

*Yee Hin Chong,Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoKA improves parameter-efficient fine-tuning for large Transformer models by using Kronecker-product tensor factorization, SVD-driven initialization, and dynamic rank selection, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining or enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large pre-trained Transformer models incurs high computational costs and storage overhead; PEFT methods aim to reduce these but face issues like latency or suboptimal convergence.

Method: The paper introduces SoKA, which applies Kronecker-product tensor factorization combined with SVD-driven initialization and adaptive rank selection algorithms for task-specific parameter updates.

Result: SoKA uses only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than existing methods, and achieves comparable or better results in benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH, and MBPP.

Conclusion: SoKA demonstrates robustness and efficiency, offering faster convergence and stable gradients for large-scale model adaptation with fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence (randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD) procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for large-scale model adaptation.

### [201] [Unlocking Post-hoc Dataset Inference with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15271)
*Bihe Zhao,Pratyush Maini,Franziska Boenisch,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for Dataset Inference (DI) to identify unauthorized use of datasets in training Large Language Models (LLMs). It generates synthetic data for DI, addressing the lack of real held-out data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue arises from unauthorized use of intellectual property in LLM training datasets. Current DI methods require unavailable in-distribution held-out data, limiting their practicality. A solution is needed to address this gap.

Method: The proposed method synthetically generates high-quality data using a suffix-based data generator and bridges likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data through post-hoc calibration. This replaces the need for real held-out datasets in DI.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the synthetic data improves DI performance, achieving high confidence in detecting original training datasets and maintaining a low false positive rate.

Conclusion: The approach facilitates reliable DI for real-world copyright claims, ensuring data owners' rights can be upheld. It positions synthetic data as a viable alternative for practical applications of DI.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability for real-world litigations.

*Chuan Li,Shunyu Zhao,Vincent Gauthier,Hassine Moungla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOVA-PATBM, a framework for optimally deploying EV fast chargers using a mix of geographic, network, and equity considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable and data-rich infrastructure planning for the growing electric vehicle market, particularly at state or national levels.

Method: Combines hierarchical grid mapping, graph neural networks for intersection importance, Voronoi tessellations for charger placement, and equity-focused, computationally efficient optimization techniques.

Result: For Georgia, USA, the framework improves EV charger accessibility by increasing coverage by 12 percentage points, halving average travel distance for low-income users, and remaining scalable nationwide.

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM effectively balances geographic, equity, power, and computational constraints, making it viable for large-scale EV charging network planning.

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated, GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced credit risk management framework leveraging generative AI to improve access to financing for SMEs engaged in cross-border e-commerce using 3PL-led SCF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the financing challenges faced by SMEs in cross-border e-commerce, which stems from limited credit histories.

Method: The authors employ Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) integrated with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) for risk estimation and loan size determination.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated effectiveness in assessing credit risk and determining loan sizes through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: Generative AI offers actionable solutions for advancing credit practices in 3PL-led SCF, ultimately enhancing SMEs' access to capital in cross-border e-commerce.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "SecFwT," an MPC-based framework enabling efficient, privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) through innovations in forward-only tuning and softmax approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where accessible training data is scarce due to strict privacy regulations.

Method: The authors propose SecFwT, which uses a forward-only tuning paradigm to bypass computationally intensive backward propagation and optimizer tasks. They also introduce MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax mechanisms, reducing complexity in secure multi-party computation (MPC) settings.

Result: SecFwT achieves significant gains in computational efficiency while maintaining strict privacy standards, making privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning feasible for scalable applications.

Conclusion: SecFwT is a groundbreaking step in integrating privacy-preserving techniques with LLMs, offering practical solutions for fine-tuning in domains where data privacy is critical.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a structured active learning strategy combining Seq2Seq variational autoencoder (VAE) and an iterative process for optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets, demonstrated on coronavirus proteases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the difficulties in drug discovery when optimizing molecules against multiple targets due to sparse rewards and conflicting design criteria.

Method: The method integrates a Seq2Seq VAE within iterative AL loops that expand chemically feasible latent space regions while progressively filtering molecules based on multi-target docking thresholds.

Result: Their approach generates structurally diverse pan-inhibitor candidates for three coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV).

Conclusion: The framework navigates sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design effectively and offers a scalable roadmap for polypharmacological challenges.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the ability of models to use partially labeled data effectively, offering theoretical insights and a practical approach for semi-supervised learning with tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how in-context learning can work with missing or incorrect labels and how deeper/looped transformer models leverage such data.

Method: The paper uses a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to simulate demonstrations with missing labels and analyzes how different transformer models process this information. Tools include polynomial estimators and connections to Expectation Maximization algorithms.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that while single-layer models fail to utilize unlabeled data, deeper or looped transformer models exploit them effectively by constructing specific estimators. Real-world evaluations confirm improved semi-supervised performance in tabular learning tasks.

Conclusion: Deeper or looped transformer-based models are adept at leveraging partially labeled data, and looping pre-existing models enhances their semi-supervised learning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to predict missing clinical test values using GPT-like embeddings, achieving significant accuracy improvements for key biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis accessibility for all through predictive modeling of non-prescribed clinical tests using performed test results.

Method: The approach models tabular clinical data as a set translation task, employing GPT-like embeddings to represent test labels and values, effectively handling missing data without imputations.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy up to 8% AUC for various clinical markers, including uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and ferritin levels.

Conclusion: The method bridges large language models and tabular data domains, enhancing diagnostic capabilities using routine clinical data.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making. Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

It employs an off-the-shelf, non-fine-tuned NNP as the teacher to generate training data, followed by a two-stage training process for the student: initial training with teacher data and fine-tuning with a smaller but high-accuracy DFT dataset.

Result: Their method effectively expands structure coverage, including high-energy structures, and improves the predictive performance of NNPs. The approach achieves comparable or superior results in modeling both organic and inorganic materials while significantly reducing expensive DFT computations.

Conclusion: The new KD framework enhances the accuracy and efficiency of NNP-based molecular dynamics simulations, broadening their applicability in various material settings while lowering computational resource requirements.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

### [209] [Acoustic Waveform Inversion with Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15346)
*A. S. Stankevich,I. B. Petrov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI²SB) framework to address limitations in applying diffusion models to seismic Full Waveform Inversion by enabling efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of velocity models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion model approaches to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) face issues such as iterative sampling inefficiency, stochasticity, and unclear methods to incorporate essential input like smoothed velocity models.

Method: The authors propose a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (cI²SB) framework that interpolates between ground truth and smoothed velocity distributions using nonlinear drift learning mechanisms.

Result: The proposed cI²SB method outperforms existing conditional diffusion-based models and supervised learning approaches in reconstructing reference velocity models, with fewer evaluations for achieving high sample fidelity.

Conclusion: The cI²SB framework offers a more efficient and accurate approach for seismic inversion tasks, bridging gaps in existing methods and enabling practical application through open-source code.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schrödinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge ($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schrödinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach.

### [210] [Enhancing One-run Privacy Auditing with Quantile Regression-Based Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15349)
*Terrance Liu,Matteo Boglioni,Yiwei Fu,Shengyuan Hu,Pratiksha Thaker,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes improving black-box differential privacy auditing by employing stronger membership inference attacks, specifically using quantile regression, to achieve tighter empirical privacy bounds while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing differential privacy auditing methods either require costly multiple training runs or provide loose privacy bounds in practical black-box settings. The authors aim to address this gap by enhancing auditing techniques for black-box scenarios.

Method: The authors incorporate stronger membership inference attacks using quantile regression in a one-run differential privacy auditing approach applied to DP-SGD-trained models.

Result: The proposed method achieves tighter privacy guarantees in black-box differential privacy auditing while maintaining computational efficiency, as demonstrated on CIFAR-10 image classification models.

Conclusion: Quantile regression-enhanced membership inference attacks can improve differential privacy auditing in black-box settings, providing more accurate privacy bounds without increasing computational demand.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

*J. Thorben Frank,Winfried Ripken,Gregor Lied,Klaus-Robert Müller,Oliver T. Unke,Stefan Chmiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiTMC, an adaptation of Diffusion Transformers, to address unique challenges in molecular conformer generation by effectively separating 3D geometry processing and atomic connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the strong performance of Diffusion Transformers in generative modeling to molecular conformer generation while tackling challenges, such as aligning molecular graph information with 3D geometry and handling variations in molecular size and structure.

Method: The proposed DiTMC framework uses a modular design to separately process 3D coordinates and atomic connectivity. It introduces two graph-based conditioning strategies and utilizes both standard and SO(3)-equivariant attention mechanisms for flexibility in accuracy vs. efficiency.

Result: DiTMC delivers state-of-the-art results in standard molecular conformer benchmarks like GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, and -XL, achieving high precision and physical validity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating architectural design and symmetry priors in enhancing molecular generative modeling, paving the way for further advancements in this domain.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative modeling of molecular structures.

### [212] [Global Ground Metric Learning with Applications to scRNA data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15383)
*Damin Kühn,Michael T. Schaub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for learning ground metrics to improve optimal transport computations, allowing for arbitrary distributions and requiring only distribution-level class labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to optimal transport often rely on predefined ground metrics or supervised learning methods using labeled data. However, predefined metrics fail to consider feature structure, and supervised methods often don't generalize across multiple classes or distributions with distinct supports.

Method: The authors propose a novel approach to learn ground metrics globally, which computes distances between points and requires only distribution-level class labels during training.

Result: Their method improves optimal transport distances, enhancing performance in embedding, clustering, and classification tasks, as demonstrated using patient-level scRNA-seq data.

Conclusion: The newly proposed approach provides interpretable and accurate metrics that extend optimal transport to handle more complex data distributions and tasks effectively.

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

*Riccardo De Santi,Marin Vlastelica,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Zebang Shen,Niao He,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for exploration using generative models, leveraging entropy maximization on diffusion models without needing explicit uncertainty quantification. This is achieved via density estimation and an algorithm based on mirror descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of exploration in real-world decision-making, particularly focusing on generating novel designs using generative models without relying on traditional uncertainty quantification methods.

Method: Formulate exploration as entropy maximization on the implicit data manifold of pre-trained diffusion models, using density estimation and mirror descent for scalable fine-tuning of these models.

Result: The approach validated with empirical tests on synthetic and text-to-image data showed promising results, confirming the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable and theoretically sound exploration framework for generative models, showcasing its potential in producing novel and high-quality outputs through fine-tuned diffusion models.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating promising results.

*Sepehr Elahi,Paula Mürmann,Patrick Thiran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing vaccination strategies for the SIS disease model on unknown graphs, providing graph learning and vaccination methods validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize the extinction time of highly contagious diseases, current vaccination optimization methods assume knowledge of the graph structure, which is often unknown in practical scenarios.

Method: Developed an inclusion-exclusion-based graph learning algorithm with proven sample complexity and a precise SRM algorithm for bounded-treewidth graphs, as well as a general polynomial-time greedy heuristic.

Result: Validated the proposed graph learning and vaccination algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The paper integrates graph learning and vaccination strategies to effectively minimize disease extinction time, overcoming the challenge of unknown graph structures.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and vaccination algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for Explainable AI (XAI) and introduces VXAI—a unified framework for evaluating explanations in AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of modern AI systems, particularly Deep Neural Networks, diminishes trustworthiness due to their opacity, creating a demand for rigorous evaluation of human-understandable explanations provided by XAI.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 362 publications, and organizing metrics into 41 functionally comparable groups while introducing a comprehensive categorization scheme.

Result: VXAI serves as a structured framework for selecting metrics, ensuring comparability, and enabling extensions in the evaluation of XAI, consolidating knowledge from the reviewed publications.

Conclusion: The work introduces a pioneering framework that comprehensively addresses challenges in XAI evaluation, enhancing rigour, comparability, and clarity in assessing AI explanations.

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection, promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for future extensions.

TL;DR: The survey reviews and categorizes reward modeling techniques in deep RL to aid policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models are needed to align RL agents' behavior with task objectives and to improve policy optimization.

Method: The paper categorizes reward modeling techniques and reviews their applications in deep RL, while discussing evaluation methods.

Result: The survey organizes reward modeling techniques systematically and identifies promising research directions.

Conclusion: Reward modeling techniques are critical for RL; further research could improve alignment and optimization approaches.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

*Scott Jeen,Tom Bewley,Jonathan M. Cullen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how zero-shot reinforcement learning methods handle partially observable environments and highlights the efficacy of memory-based architectures in addressing the challenges posed by such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often deal with partial observability instead of fully Markovian states, which challenges the generalizability of zero-shot RL methods developed under the assumption of complete observability.

Method: The authors examine the degradation of performance in zero-shot RL due to partial observability and propose the use of memory-based architectures. These architectures are evaluated across tasks with partially observed states, rewards, and dynamics.

Result: Memory-based zero-shot RL methods show improved performance in environments with partial observability compared to memory-free baselines.

Conclusion: While zero-shot RL methods struggle with partial observability, integrating memory-based architectures effectively mitigates this issue and enhances learning outcomes in complex environments.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show improved performance over memory-free baselines.

### [218] [Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448)
*Guoguo Ai,Hezhe Qiao,Hui Yan,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RHO, a method for semi-supervised graph anomaly detection that improves node homophily learning using adaptive filters and normality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge that normal nodes in a graph often exhibit diverse homophily, leading to suboptimal performance in existing detection methods.

Method: RHO includes two components: adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA), designed to learn and robustify diverse homophily patterns.

Result: RHO demonstrates superior performance across eight real-world GAD datasets, effectively capturing varying homophily patterns and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses varying levels of homophily in normal nodes, improving semi-supervised anomaly detection on graphs.

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a method addressing limitations in current neural network feature interpretation by offering nuanced descriptions that consider polysemanticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness and expressiveness of feature descriptions in neural network interpretability and address the challenge of polysemantic neurons.

Method: Developed PRISM, a framework providing nuanced descriptions for both mono- and polysemantic features in neural networks, and benchmarked it against existing methods.

Result: PRISM outperforms existing methods in generating accurate and comprehensive descriptions, as evaluated by a description score and a polysemanticity score.

Conclusion: PRISM advances feature interpretability by accounting for the complexity of polysemantic neurons, offering more robust and expressive descriptions for neural network features.

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel dimensionality reduction (DR) technique that uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to allow user-guided, interpretable visualizations through natural language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR techniques do not effectively explore or integrate semantic structures that are not directly observable as data variables or class labels, limiting their utility for custom, human-centric data exploration.

Method: The proposed method incorporates zero-shot classification enabled by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), allowing users to guide and customize DR projections interactively through natural-language prompt inputs, based on their analytical goals.

Result: The framework enhances the separation of clusters in data and transforms DR into an interactive and user-driven process, as validated across several datasets.

Conclusion: This approach bridges the gap between automated natural language-based DR techniques and human-centered data visualizations by offering flexibility, adaptability, and tailored insights for specific tasks.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable, data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive, user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies safety vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) during fine-tuning processes and introduces a method called Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX) to enhance robustness against such threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the paper arises from the need to address safety concerns of LLMs, particularly in their susceptibility to safety breaches during subsequent fine-tuning even with seemingly benign data.

Method: The method proposed, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), involves leveraging safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to improve resistance to perturbations caused by fine-tuning. LoX is a training-free approach.

Result: Experimental results show that LoX reduces attack success rates by 11% to 54% under benign or malicious fine-tuning scenarios while maintaining LLM flexibility for new tasks, and attributes the reduced sensitivity to a flatter parameter zone.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LoX is an effective training-free solution for increasing safety robustness in LLMs, making them less sensitive to fine-tuning perturbations without sacrificing adaptability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule automates the extraction of rules from preference feedback to form rule-based rewards for reinforcement learning, demonstrating improved outcomes and reduced reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rule-based reward techniques in RLHF require manually engineered rules, restricting scalability and efficiency.

Method: AutoRule automates rule extraction in three stages: 1) reasoning model interprets preferences, 2) extracts candidate rules from these interpretations, 3) synthesizes a unified rule set, which is verified and utilized as auxiliary rewards in policy optimization.

Result: Using AutoRule, a Llama-3-8B model showed a 28.6% improvement in length-controlled win rate and a 6.1% gain in second-turn performance compared to the baseline, with rules demonstrating alignment to preferences and reduced reward hacking.

Conclusion: AutoRule enhances RLHF outcomes by replacing manual rule engineering with automated and interpretable rule-based methods, improving both performance and alignment efficiency.

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.

Motivation: To address the issue of non-robustness in post-hoc attribution methods, which undermines trust in their explanations of predictions.

Method: The authors use randomized smoothing and sparsification to transform attribution maps into segmentation problems, providing robustness guarantees against perturbations.

Result: They evaluated 12 attribution methods on 5 ImageNet models and demonstrated robustness, interpretability, and faithfulness in certified attributions.

Conclusion: Certified attribution approaches offer reliable explanations, paving the way for trustworthy use in downstream applications.

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks.

### [225] [Dense SAE Latents Are Features, Not Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15679)
*Xiaoqing Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Joshua Engels,Ben Wu,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Mrinmaya Sachan,Max Tegmark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates dense latents in sparse autoencoders (SAEs), concluding they often carry meaningful representations rather than being undesirable artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address concerns regarding dense latents in SAEs, which activate frequently and are often perceived as artifacts rather than useful features.

Method: The authors examine dense latents' geometry, functionality, and origin through systematic analysis, introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, and study their evolution across neural network layers.

Result: Dense latents are shown to frequently form meaningful and functionally significant representations, including tracking positions, binding context, regulating entropy, and reconstructing principal components.

Conclusion: Dense latents are intrinsic to the residual space, serve essential computation roles, and should not be dismissed as artifacts of the training process.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise.

### [226] [Over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15507)
*Ivan Marisca,Jacob Bamberger,Cesare Alippi,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the issue of over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs), where distant nodes and temporal aspects hinder effective information exchange, and provides theoretical and experimental insights into its characteristics and remedies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address and study the under-explored issue of over-squashing in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks, which hampers effective information propagation, especially when dealing with temporal sequences.

Method: The paper formalizes the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem, analyzes its characteristics theoretically, and validates findings through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Key findings include discovering that convolutional STGNNs prioritize propagating information from temporally distant points and showing that time-and-space or time-then-space architectures are similarly affected by over-squashing.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing more effective and efficient Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network architectures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information. While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

### [227] [RePCS: Diagnosing Data Memorization in LLM-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15513)
*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Luong Van Nghia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RePCS, a method to detect whether retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely on memorized data instead of retrieved context, by using KL divergence between parametric and retrieval-augmented inference paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With RAG systems increasingly used to incorporate external information into Large Language Models (LLMs), there's a risk that these models might bypass the retrieved evidence and produce outputs contaminated by their memorized training data.

Method: The paper introduces Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), which involves comparing KL divergence between parametric-only and retrieval-augmented output distributions to identify if retrieved context impacts the final output. It is model-agnostic and requires only an additional forward pass.

Result: RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918 on the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, outperforming previous methods by 6.5% while keeping latency overhead under 4.7% using an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

Conclusion: RePCS provides a lightweight, effective, and model-agnostic diagnostic tool to ensure RAG systems meaningfully utilize retrieved context, which is particularly beneficial in safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight, black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

*Hristo Papazov,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study extends Gold's learning framework with new types of computational observations to investigate the learnability of general recursive functions under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods for learning general recursive functions under practical constraints such as computation complexity or restricted input sources.

Method: The authors introduced Time-Bound and Policy-Trajectory Observations to expand the inductive inference framework. They analyzed learnability under computational constraints and formalized agent-based learning models.

Result: They demonstrated how computational complexity constraints or approximate time-bound observations enable learning general recursive functions, but also showed that characteristic sets cannot exist for linear-time computable functions with policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: By incorporating computational and policy-based observations, the paper broadens our understanding of function learnability, highlighting both new possibilities and inherent limitations.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and resolve the challenges associated with scaling deep reinforcement learning networks, which often lead to degraded performance and remain poorly understood.

Method: Empirical analyses to identify causes such as non-stationarity combined with gradient pathologies, along with proposing and testing simple architectural interventions to stabilize gradient flow.

Result: The proposed interventions enabled robust performance across a range of network depths and widths, tested across various agents and environments.

Conclusion: Simple, easily implementable interventions can address scaling challenges and allow reinforcement learning networks to perform strongly even at large scales.

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of agents and suites of environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Domain shifts from device heterogeneity and temporal variations pose challenges for Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor localization. DAILOC framework leverages a variational autoencoder and memory-guided strategies to mitigate domain shifts and catastrophic forgetting, significantly improving localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world challenges in Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor localization caused by device and temporal domain variations that impact generalization and result in catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Develop DAILOC framework using a multi-level variational autoencoder to disentangle domain shifts and introduce memory-guided latent alignment mechanisms to mitigate forgetting.

Result: DAILOC achieves 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing effective performance against various domain shifts.

Conclusion: DAILOC robustly addresses both device-induced and temporal domain challenges, significantly improving the reliability and accuracy of indoor localization systems in real-world settings.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time. Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

*Danish Gufran,Sudeep Pasricha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogNet, a new logic gate-based framework, enhances the interpretability and reliability of DL-based indoor localization models, while also improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based indoor localization models function as black-box systems, making it difficult to understand their behavior or address the impact of environmental noise and temporal variations.

Method: LogNet leverages a logic gate-based framework to identify influential access points and diagnose the effects of environmental dynamics, enabling transparent reasoning and long-term model adaptation.

Result: LogNet achieves up to 2.8x lower localization error, up to 43.3x smaller model size, and up to 3.6x lower latency across real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: LogNet not only interprets the internal mechanisms of DL models for indoor localization but also improves their overall accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability for real-world long-term use.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the compositional capability of neural networks, aligning them closer to human reasoning, for more efficient and sustainable AI solutions.

Result: The proposed Expert Composition method significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of accuracy while being more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The compositional approach using expert models is valid for achieving high performance on complex benchmarks with efficiency gains, showcasing its relevance for sustainable AI.

Abstract: Compositionality is one of the fundamental abilities of the human reasoning process, that allows to decompose a complex problem into simpler elements. Such property is crucial also for neural networks, especially when aiming for a more efficient and sustainable AI framework. We propose a compositional approach by ensembling zero-shot a set of expert models, assessing our methodology using a challenging benchmark, designed to test compositionality capabilities. We show that our Expert Composition method is able to achieve a much higher accuracy than baseline algorithms while requiring less computational resources, hence being more efficient.

*Le Vu Anh,Nguyen Viet Anh,Mehmet Dik,Tu Nguyen Thi Ngoc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroRicci introduces an efficient and automatic local Ricci-flow solver for real-time mesh smoothing, outperforming traditional methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of performing real-time mesh smoothing is hindered by the inefficiency and complexity of classical Ricci-flow solvers and the instability of current heuristics.

Method: MicroRicci employs a greedy syndrome-decoding step for curvature error correction in O(E) time, supported by neural modules for adaptive vertex and step size selection.

Result: MicroRicci achieves a 2.4x speedup in iteration count, improves curvature spread, sets a high UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation (r = -0.93), and reduces runtime per iteration by 0.25 ms.

Conclusion: MicroRicci stands out as a self-tuning, efficient, and high-quality solution, making it ideal for resource-constrained applications in graphics and simulations.

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes, MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup), tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates, automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in graphics, simulation, and related fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction) is a novel method for differential privacy in neural network training that reduces memory overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP training methods like DP-Adam face scalability issues due to high memory demands from per-sample gradient clipping. This calls for approaches that are both efficient in memory usage and maintain good privacy-utility trade-offs.

Method: DP-GRAPE uses three main innovations: (1) privatizing gradients after random Gaussian-based projection, (2) substituting costly SVD computations with random matrices, and (3) projecting gradients during backpropagation to enhance efficiency.

Result: DP-GRAPE achieves significant memory savings (e.g., 63% reduction during Vision Transformer pre-training and 70% during RoBERTa-Large fine-tuning) while providing competitive accuracy and training times compared to DP-Adam. It scales effectively even for large-scale models like OPT with 6.7 billion parameters.

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE offers a scalable and memory-efficient solution for DP neural network training, proving to be a practical alternative to traditional methods like DP-Adam without compromising privacy or utility.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with up to 6.7 billion parameters.

*Modar Sulaiman,Kallol Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC) to address biased and noisy labels in machine learning datasets, enhancing fairness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems are increasingly impacting critical societal decisions, yet suffer from unfair outcomes due to biased and noisy labels in training data, necessitating better fairness-aware methods.

Method: The GFLC method incorporates prediction confidence measures, graph-based regularization via Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit incentives for demographic parity.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate GFLC's effectiveness, showcasing significant improvements in balancing fairness and performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: GFLC emerges as a promising approach to tackle label bias and improve fairness in machine learning systems, proving its efficacy in important metrics.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However, the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing. To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR) to address over-conservatism caused by poor explorations in offline RL datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the robustness of offline RL algorithms that are overly conservative due to corrupted and suboptimal data in offline datasets.

Method: CAWR combines robust loss functions in policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations.

Result: CAWR demonstrates superior policy learning on suboptimal offline datasets, outperforming existing baselines on the D4RL benchmark.

Conclusion: CAWR successfully mitigates the effects of poor explorations in offline datasets, resulting in enhanced policy optimization and RL algorithm performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues, such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel STDP-based learning rule for synaptic weights and delays, validates it with SNN models, and demonstrates superior classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synaptic delays are vital in biological neural networks, yet inadequately represented in neuromorphic computing. Incorporating them enhances the emulation of biological learning processes.

Method: The paper extends STDP to jointly learn synaptic weights and delays, applying the method in unsupervised learning for SNN models.

Result: Experiments reveal the new method's superior performance compared to existing approaches and STDP without delays, highlighting the significance of synaptic delays.

Conclusion: The introduced approach improves classification in SNNs and provides insights into the role of synaptic delays in neural computation.

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do, synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

TL;DR: GI-GOMEA integrates the Gene Invariant approach with GOMEA, enhancing population diversity and outperforming traditional methods in complex optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of population diversity loss in EAs with Optimal Mixing, which affects the solving of hierarchical problems featuring layers of complexity.

Method: Leveraging Gene Invariant Genetic Algorithm (GIGA) to preserve gene frequencies and integrating it within the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing framework.

Result: GI-GOMEA demonstrates superior performance over traditional GOMEA in benchmark and hierarchical problems, including asymmetric hierarchical trap functions.

Conclusion: GI-GOMEA offers a straightforward yet impactful improvement to EAs, excelling in both classic and hierarchical optimization scenarios.

Abstract: Optimal Mixing (OM) is a variation operator that integrates local search with genetic recombination. EAs with OM are capable of state-of-the-art optimization in discrete spaces, offering significant advantages over classic recombination-based EAs. This success is partly due to high selection pressure that drives rapid convergence. However, this can also negatively impact population diversity, complicating the solving of hierarchical problems, which feature multiple layers of complexity. While there have been attempts to address this issue, these solutions are often complicated and prone to bias. To overcome this, we propose a solution inspired by the Gene Invariant Genetic Algorithm (GIGA), which preserves gene frequencies in the population throughout the process. This technique is tailored to and integrated with the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA), resulting in GI-GOMEA. The simple, yet elegant changes are found to have striking potential: GI-GOMEA outperforms GOMEA on a range of well-known problems, even when these problems are adjusted for pitfalls - biases in much-used benchmark problems that can be easily exploited by maintaining gene invariance. Perhaps even more notably, GI-GOMEA is also found to be effective at solving hierarchical problems, including newly introduced asymmetric hierarchical trap functions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for drift analysis focused on hitting probability to improve the estimation of time complexity in evolutionary algorithms, addressing limitations in traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drift analysis in evolutionary algorithms requires manual construction of drift functions, which is cumbersome and problem-specific. This paper seeks to simplify and generalize the process.

Method: The proposed method uses hitting probability as an alternative to hitting time estimation, introducing paths to handle multimodal fitness landscapes. It constructs explicit expressions for hitting probability.

Result: The method is able to compute both lower and upper bounds on hitting time and compare algorithm performance effectively, demonstrated on two knapsack problem algorithms.

Conclusion: The novel drift analysis method simplifies complexity estimation, enables practical comparisons of algorithms, and demonstrates that no single constraint handling technique is universally superior.

Abstract: Drift analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing the time complexity of evolutionary algorithms. However, it requires manual construction of drift functions to bound hitting time for each specific algorithm and problem. To address this limitation, general linear drift functions were introduced for elitist evolutionary algorithms. But calculating linear bound coefficients effectively remains a problem. This paper proposes a new method called drift analysis of hitting probability to compute these coefficients. Each coefficient is interpreted as a bound on the hitting probability of a fitness level, transforming the task of estimating hitting time into estimating hitting probability. A novel drift analysis method is then developed to estimate hitting probability, where paths are introduced to handle multimodal fitness landscapes. Explicit expressions are constructed to compute hitting probability, significantly simplifying the estimation process. One advantage of the proposed method is its ability to estimate both the lower and upper bounds of hitting time and to compare the performance of two algorithms in terms of hitting time. To demonstrate this application, two algorithms for the knapsack problem, each incorporating feasibility rules and greedy repair respectively, are compared. The analysis indicates that neither constraint handling technique consistently outperforms the other.

### [240] [Atys: An Efficient Profiling Framework for Identifying Hotspot Functions in Large-scale Cloud Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15523)
*Jiaqi Sun,Dingyu Yang,Shiyou Qian,Jian Cao,Guangtao Xue*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: Atys1 is a profiling framework designed to efficiently identify hotspots in large-scale distributed services, achieving reduced costs and minimal performance errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to improve performance and reduce costs for large-scale services consisting of multilingual microservices deployed in the cloud.

Method: The authors introduce Atys1, which incorporates four features: a language-agnostic adaptation mechanism, two-level flamegraph aggregation, function selective pruning (FSP), and frequency dynamic adjustment (FDA).

Result: Experiments demonstrate a 6.8% reduction in time with 0.58% MAPE using FSP and an 87.6% cost reduction with comparable accuracy when using the FDA scheme.

Conclusion: Atys1 successfully identifies performance hotspots in distributed services, offering significant efficiency improvements while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: To handle the high volume of requests, large-scale services are comprised of thousands of instances deployed in clouds. These services utilize diverse programming languages and are distributed across various nodes as encapsulated containers. Given their vast scale, even minor performance enhancements can lead to significant cost reductions. In this paper, we introduce Atys1, an efficient profiling framework specifically designed to identify hotspot functions within large-scale distributed services. Atys presents four key features. First, it implements a language-agnostic adaptation mechanism for multilingual microservices. Second, a two-level aggregation method is introduced to provide a comprehensive overview of flamegraphs. Third, we propose a function selective pruning (FSP) strategy to enhance the efficiency of aggregating profiling results. Finally, we develop a frequency dynamic adjustment (FDA) scheme that dynamically modifies sampling frequency based on service status, effectively minimizing profiling cost while maintaining accuracy. Cluster-scale experiments on two benchmarks show that the FSP strategy achieves a 6.8% reduction in time with a mere 0.58% mean average percentage error (MAPE) in stack traces aggregation. Additionally, the FDA scheme ensures that the mean squared error (MSE) remains on par with that at high sampling rates, while achieving an 87.6% reduction in cost.

### [241] [A Novel Compiler Transformation for Fast Sparse Matrix Multiplication in GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15174)
*Hossein Albakri,Kazem Cheshmi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a compiler transformation for sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPUs, achieving up to 2.27× speedup over existing libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently running sparse data structures on GPUs is challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to slow-downs in workloads like neural networks.

Method: The authors introduce the 'enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen' compiler transformation, designed to enhance register/cache data reuse and create balanced GPU workloads.

Result: Their transformation achieves geometric mean speedups of 1.84× to 2.27× for sparse neural networks on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in GPU performance optimization for sparse neural network operations, showcasing practical benefits for real-world machine learning applications.

Abstract: Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the memory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities such as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory hierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but running compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due to inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new compiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices. The transformation increases data reuse in registers and caches while creating more balanced workloads for GPU computing resources. The transformation is tested on sparse neural networks in convolutional and transformer models. On an A100 GPU and across a columns of matrix B (bCols) in $ A \times B = C$ from range of 32 to 128, the transformation yields a geometric mean speedup of 1.84$\times$ to 2.27$\times$ compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines, respectively.

### [242] [PSM: Policy Synchronised Deterministic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15424)
*Michael Mendler,Marc Pouzet*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Policy Synchronized Memory (PSM) for Haskell, a type context combining determinacy and concurrency, addressing previously conflicting requirements in shared resource programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile concurrency and determinacy in Haskell, as existing abstractions either lack destructive updates or compromise determinacy in shared state programming.

Method: The authors developed PSM as a new type context in Haskell, incorporating policy-coordinated accesses to ensure race-free concurrent behaviors while enabling imperative updates.

Result: PSM allows for well-typed transactions with deterministic behavior, even for imperative and concurrently shared abstract data structures in Haskell.

Conclusion: PSM provides a robust framework for developing concurrent, deterministically behaving programs with shared memory in Haskell, resolving limitations in existing paradigms.

Abstract: Concurrency and determinacy do not go well with each other when resources must be shared. Haskell provides parallel programming abstractions such as IVar and LVar in the Par monad and concurrent abstractions such as MVar and TVar in the in IO and STM monads, respectively. The former are determinate but have no destructive updates and the latter have destructive updates but do not guarantee determinacy. Programming patterns that are both concurrent and determinate, such as those provided by Kahn or Berry require memory abstractions at a higher level than is currently available. In this paper we describe a new type context PSM for policy synchronised memory in Haskell. Like STM and IO, the computations in PSM can access persistent state and, as a side-effect, update the memory in imperative style. Like the Par and IO monads, PSM supports concurrent threads and shared state. However, in contrast to IO, our PSM contexts are race-free since concurrent accesses are policy coordinated which guarantees determinacy.Well-typed transactions in the PSM context can accommodate abstract data structures that are imperative, concurrently shareable and still behave deterministically, by construction.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI, a novel enhancement to Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control by incorporating local linear feedback for real-time, high-frequency robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational demands of MPPI limit its applicability in real-time, high-frequency control scenarios for complex robotic tasks.

Method: F-MPPI computes local linear feedback gains via sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback in gradient-based MPC, allowing rapid closed-loop corrections without full re-optimization.

Result: Simulations and experiments on a quadrupedal robot and a quadrotor showed improved control performance, stability, and robustness under real-time operation.

Conclusion: Feedback-MPPI enhances MPPI, enabling more efficient, robust, and high-frequency control suitable for complex robotic systems.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time, highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands. This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empower visually impaired individuals by leveraging autonomous drones with advanced computing capabilities to safely navigate challenging urban outdoor environments.

Method: The paper proposes a perception-based local path planning system combined with a global GPS-based planner. A multi-DNN (Deep Neural Network) framework is utilized for obstacle avoidance for both the UAV and the VIP.

Result: The system was evaluated on a university campus and demonstrated effectiveness in three scenarios: walking on a footpath, encountering parked vehicles, and navigating crowded streets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is technically viable, highlighting the potential of UAV-based solutions to assist visually impaired people in navigating urban areas safely.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains, including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a perception-based path planning system for local planning around the neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a crowded street.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALSPG, an efficient motion generation method for robots, leveraging geometric constraints for improved real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current robot programming tools that inadequately utilize geometric constraints for object interaction across diverse shapes.

Method: Developed and tested a first-order optimization method called ALSPG, which relies on geometric projections using Euclidean projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions.

Result: ALSPG demonstrated competitive performance against second-order methods like iLQR and achieved real-time efficiency in simulations and real-world experiments on multiple robot models.

Conclusion: The ALSPG method effectively handles constrained optimization for robotic motions, achieving faster real-time solutions. Supporting materials are available online.

Abstract: Generating motions for robots interacting with objects of various shapes is a complex challenge, further complicated by the robot geometry and multiple desired behaviors. While current robot programming tools (such as inverse kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale car in real-world experiments.

TL;DR: FEAST is a personalized mealtime-assistance robot system that improves user adaptability, transparency, and safety during feeding tasks in diverse real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of in-home meal assistance, including diverse activities, user preferences, and social contexts, which current systems struggle to accommodate.

Method: Developed the FEAST system with modular hardware, diverse interaction methods, and parameterized behavior trees that can be adapted using a large language model. Evaluated through user and occupational therapist studies.

Result: FEAST offers safe, transparent, and highly adaptable features that outperform state-of-the-art systems in personalization. Successfully tested across diverse scenarios in real-world user studies.

Conclusion: FEAST demonstrates real-world applicability for in-home meal assistance, effectively meeting the unique and varied needs of individual users while maintaining safety and usability.

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

*Jeffrey Mao,Raghuram Cauligi Srinivas,Steven Nogar,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time onboard navigation system for quadrotors using lightweight sensors that outperforms others in efficiency and obstacle avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous navigation for quadrotors in complex, unknown environments is hampered by SWaP constraints and the lack of lightweight sensors capable of real-time decision-making.

Method: The system uses a novel depth estimation technique combining stereo and monocular approaches, constructs a dense 3D map, and applies advanced planning and trajectory generation frameworks.

Result: The developed system achieves longer-range, denser, and less noisy depth maps, guarantees obstacle-free trajectories, and surpasses existing methods in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Through robust autonomous flight experiments, the system proves effective for safe navigation in previously unknown indoor and outdoor environments.

Abstract: Quadrotors hold significant promise for several applications such as agriculture, search and rescue, and infrastructure inspection. Achieving autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP), which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser, and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories. As the map is incrementally updated with new depth information, our system continuously refines the trajectory to maintain safety and optimality. Both our planner and trajectory generator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and guarantee obstacle-free trajectories. We validate our system through robust autonomous flight experiments in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for safe navigation in previously unknown settings.

*Jinjie Li,Jiaxuan Li,Kotaro Kaneko,Liming Shu,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an aerial teleoperation system that mimics human hand movements for controlling omnidirectional aerial robots in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve teleoperation methods for omnidirectional aerial robots, leveraging human dexterity and additional degrees of freedom.

Method: The system uses motion-tracking markers on the shoulder and hand, combined with a data glove, and integrates four interaction modes for diverse aerial manipulation tasks.

Result: The proposed system is tested on a valve-turning task, showing its effectiveness and flexibility in aerial manipulation tasks involving human input.

Conclusion: The framework connects human dexterity to aerial robotics, enabling better control and interaction in complex unstructured environments.

Abstract: Omnidirectional aerial robots offer full 6-DoF independent control over position and orientation, making them popular for aerial manipulation. Although advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced teleoperated aerial manipulation in unstructured environments.

### [249] [Context Matters: Learning Generalizable Rewards via Calibrated Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15012)
*Alexandra Forsey-Smerek,Julie Shah,Andreea Bobu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the context-dependence of agent reward learning by distinguishing between invariant preferences and context-dependent feature saliency, achieving more efficient learning and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiency in reward learning caused by treating every new context as a separate task, even when the underlying preferences remain unchanged.

Method: The authors propose explicitly separating context-invariant preferences from context-dependent feature saliency. They introduce calibrated features to model contextual effects and use specialized paired comparison queries to distinguish preferences from saliency.

Result: Their method improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than baselines to achieve comparable reward accuracy. It achieves up to 15% better performance in low-data regimes and allows effective teaching of personal contextual preferences.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling context-invariant preferences and feature saliency enables more efficient, adaptable, and personalized reward learning, as demonstrated by simulated and in-person user studies.

Abstract: A key challenge in reward learning from human input is that desired agent behavior often changes based on context. Traditional methods typically treat each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example, if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the $\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn context-dependent representations $\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data requirements. Instead, we propose $\textit{explicitly}$ modeling context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts. To achieve this, we introduce $\textit{calibrated features}$--representations that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries). An in-person user study (N=12) demonstrates that participants can effectively teach their unique personal contextual preferences using our method, enabling more adaptable and personalized reward learning.

*Winston Smith,Andrew Boateng,Taha Shaheen,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task allocation framework for assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots, addressing physical constraints ignored in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task allocation for robots assumes single-tasking, which may be inefficient or infeasible for certain applications.

Method: The problem is formulated with weighted MAX-SAT and solved using existing solvers, alongside a developed greedy heuristic for efficiency.

Result: Evaluation includes comparisons with baselines, synthetic scenario tests, simulation, and physical experiments, demonstrating improved task efficiency from multitasking robots.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical constraints for multitasking robots leads to significant improvement in task efficiency compared to single-tasking assumptions.

Abstract: One simplifying assumption in existing and well-performing task allocation methods is that the robots are single-tasking: each robot operates on a single task at any given time. While this assumption is harmless to make in some situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper, we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic setting.

TL;DR: The paper presents EmojiVoice, a customizable and real-time text-to-speech toolkit for social robots, utilizing emoji prompting to create temporally variable and expressive speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of long-term variation in expressivity in social robots' speech, which is critical for maintaining listener engagement.

Method: Developed EmojiVoice, a lightweight TTS toolkit based on Matcha-TTS, and introduced emoji-prompting to enable fine-grained control of expressivity.

Result: Case studies demonstrated that varied emoji prompting improved speech perception and expressivity in storytelling, though expressive voices were not always preferred in all use cases.

Conclusion: EmojiVoice successfully introduces more expressive, temporally variable speech to social robots, though preference for expressivity depends on context.

Abstract: Humans vary their expressivity when speaking for extended periods to maintain engagement with their listener. Although social robots tend to be deployed with ``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human speech. Foundation model text-to-speech systems are beginning to mimic the expressivity in human speech, but they are difficult to deploy offline on robots. We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS) toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3) an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent. We found that using varied emoji prompting improved the perception and expressivity of speech over a long period in a storytelling task, but expressive voice was not preferred in the assistant use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable anthropomorphic grippers with human-like haptic perception by overcoming challenges in transitioning planar VTSs to biomimetically curved surfaces.

Method: The study introduces 1) GelSplitter3D (prism-based imaging and NIR camera), 2) a photometric stereo neural network with CAD-based calibration, and 3) a normal integration method with depth-informed boundary correction.

Result: The method achieves better tactile sensing, including a 40% improvement in normal estimation accuracy, demonstrating advantages in grasping and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The study successfully overcomes VTS challenges on curved surfaces, providing solutions for enhanced human-like haptic perception in robotics.

Abstract: To achieve human-like haptic perception in anthropomorphic grippers, the compliant sensing surfaces of vision tactile sensor (VTS) must evolve from conventional planar configurations to biomimetically curved topographies with continuous surface gradients. However, planar VTSs have challenges when extended to curved surfaces, including insufficient lighting of surfaces, blurring in reconstruction, and complex spatial boundary conditions for surface structures. With an end goal of constructing a human-like fingertip, our research (i) develops GelSplitter3D by expanding imaging channels with a prism and a near-infrared (NIR) camera, (ii) proposes a photometric stereo neural network with a CAD-based normal ground truth generation method to calibrate tactile geometry, and (iii) devises a normal integration method with boundary constraints of depth prior information to correcting the cumulative error of surface integrals. We demonstrate better tactile sensing performance, a 40$\%$ improvement in normal estimation accuracy, and the benefits of sensor shapes in grasping and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DyNaVLM offers a new paradigm for embodied AI by enabling flexible navigation, collaborative memory usage, and eliminating the need for task-specific training, paving the way for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present DyNaVLM, an end-to-end vision-language navigation framework using Vision-Language Models (VLM). In contrast to prior methods constrained by fixed angular or distance intervals, our system empowers agents to freely select navigation targets via visual-language reasoning. At its core lies a self-refining graph memory that 1) stores object locations as executable topological relations, 2) enables cross-robot memory sharing through distributed graph updates, and 3) enhances VLM's decision-making via retrieval augmentation. Operating without task-specific training or fine-tuning, DyNaVLM demonstrates high performance on GOAT and ObjectNav benchmarks. Real-world tests further validate its robustness and generalization. The system's three innovations: dynamic action space formulation, collaborative graph memory, and training-free deployment, establish a new paradigm for scalable embodied robot, bridging the gap between discrete VLN tasks and continuous real-world navigation.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of task-specific synthesized voices for language teaching robots, focusing on lightweight, expressive voices, environmental adaptability, and enhanced clarity for second-language (L2) English learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited work on creating synthesized voices specifically tailored for language teaching robots, which could impact their effectiveness in verbal language teaching tasks.

Method: The study fine-tuned Matcha-TTS for expressiveness with emoji prompting, adapted robot voices to environmental factors, and integrated L2 clarity mode to improve vowel interpretation for second-language English learners.

Result: The expressive voices were found suitable for storytelling, adaptive changes in pitch improved environmental awareness, and clarity mode reduced transcription errors and improved L2 listeners' perception.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of designing specialized voices tailored to language-learning robots, offering improved expressibility, environmental adaptability, and enhanced intelligibility for L2 learners.

Abstract: While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there remains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language teaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an "L2 clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated significant improvements in robustness and accuracy of state estimation in underwater environments through experimental validation.

Conclusion: VIMS effectively enhances underwater SLAM by addressing critical issues in scale estimation and loop closure, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution.

Abstract: In this study, we present a novel simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system, VIMS, designed for underwater navigation. Conventional visual-inertial state estimators encounter significant practical challenges in perceptually degraded underwater environments, particularly in scale estimation and loop closing. To address these issues, we first propose leveraging a low-cost single-beam sonar to improve scale estimation. Then, VIMS integrates a high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition by utilizing magnetic signatures generated by an economical magnetic field coil. Building on this, a hierarchical scheme is developed for visual-magnetic place recognition, enabling robust loop closure. Furthermore, VIMS achieves a balance between local feature tracking and descriptor-based loop closing, avoiding additional computational burden on the front end. Experimental results highlight the efficacy of the proposed VIMS, demonstrating significant improvements in both the robustness and accuracy of state estimation within underwater environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in whole-body contact manipulation such as high computational costs and difficulty in measuring wide-area contact.

Result: Detailed experiments show that combining vision and tactile inputs improves the robustness of delicate manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances whole-body contact manipulation in humanoid robots, with better robustness and balance maintenance.

Abstract: Manipulation with whole-body contact by humanoid robots offers distinct advantages, including enhanced stability and reduced load. On the other hand, we need to address challenges such as the increased computational cost of motion generation and the difficulty of measuring broad-area contact. We therefore have developed a humanoid control system that allows a humanoid robot equipped with tactile sensors on its upper body to learn a policy for whole-body manipulation through imitation learning based on human teleoperation data. This policy, named tactile-modality extended ACT (TACT), has a feature to take multiple sensor modalities as input, including joint position, vision, and tactile measurements. Furthermore, by integrating this policy with retargeting and locomotion control based on a biped model, we demonstrate that the life-size humanoid robot RHP7 Kaleido is capable of achieving whole-body contact manipulation while maintaining balance and walking. Through detailed experimental verification, we show that inputting both vision and tactile modalities into the policy contributes to improving the robustness of manipulation involving broad and delicate contact.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the accuracy and robustness of gait phase estimation in exoskeletons, particularly in challenging conditions like terrain variations.

Result: The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in both stable terrain and terrain transition scenarios, with lower errors compared to baseline models. Real-world validation on a hip exoskeleton confirmed its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant advancements in gait phase estimation, contributing to the development of more adaptive and intelligent exoskeleton systems for diverse environments.

Abstract: Gait phase estimation based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals facilitates precise adaptation of exoskeletons to individual gait variations. However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy and robustness, particularly during periods of terrain changes. To address this, we develop a gait phase estimation neural network based on implicit modeling of human locomotion, which combines temporal convolution for feature extraction with transformer layers for multi-channel information fusion. A channel-wise masked reconstruction pre-training strategy is proposed, which first treats gait phase state vectors and IMU signals as joint observations of human locomotion, thus enhancing model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches, achieving a gait phase RMSE of $2.729 \pm 1.071%$ and phase rate MAE of $0.037 \pm 0.016%$ under stable terrain conditions with a look-back window of 2 seconds, and a phase RMSE of $3.215 \pm 1.303%$ and rate MAE of $0.050 \pm 0.023%$ under terrain transitions. Hardware validation on a hip exoskeleton further confirms that the algorithm can reliably identify gait cycles and key events, adapting to various continuous motion scenarios. This research paves the way for more intelligent and adaptive exoskeleton systems, enabling safer and more efficient human-robot interaction across diverse real-world environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIP (Robust Instant Policy) to mitigate the hallucination issues in In-Context Imitation Learning for robotics, achieving improved task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address weaknesses in robotic In-Context Imitation Learning caused by poor trajectories (hallucinations) from Large Language Model-based policies.

Method: Develop RIP using Student's t-regression to aggregate multiple LLM-generated trajectories and mitigate outliers, ensuring robust task performance.

Result: Experiments in simulated and real scenarios indicate RIP improves task success rates by at least 26% compared to existing methods, especially in low-data settings.

Conclusion: RIP effectively addresses hallucination problems, enhancing reliability and success rates in robotic In-Context Imitation Learning tasks.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Motivation: Existing research struggles with integrating heterogeneous radar modalities, hindering generalization and performance across diverse radar data types.

Method: SHeRLoc employs RCS polar matching, hierarchical optimal transport-based feature aggregation, FFT-similarity-based data mining, and adaptive margin-based triplet loss for metric learning.

Result: SHeRLoc significantly improves place recognition performance, achieving recall@1 of 0.9 on public datasets and surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHeRLoc advances place recognition in heterogeneous radar systems and opens possibilities for broader applications in cross-modal sensor integration and SLAM.

Abstract: Despite the growing adoption of radar in robotics, the majority of research has been confined to homogeneous sensor types, overlooking the integration and cross-modality challenges inherent in heterogeneous radar technologies. This leads to significant difficulties in generalizing across diverse radar data types, with modality-aware approaches that could leverage the complementary strengths of heterogeneous radar remaining unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we propose SHeRLoc, the first deep network tailored for heterogeneous radar, which utilizes RCS polar matching to align multimodal radar data. Our hierarchical optimal transport-based feature aggregation method generates rotationally robust multi-scale descriptors. By employing FFT-similarity-based data mining and adaptive margin-based triplet loss, SHeRLoc enables FOV-aware metric learning. SHeRLoc achieves an order of magnitude improvement in heterogeneous radar place recognition, increasing recall@1 from below 0.1 to 0.9 on a public dataset and outperforming state of-the-art methods. Also applicable to LiDAR, SHeRLoc paves the way for cross-modal place recognition and heterogeneous sensor SLAM. The source code will be available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive robotics control method by extending deep Lagrangian networks (DeLaN) with context-aware modeling integrated with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) system, achieving improved tracking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise from complex environments where numerous unknown objects can interact with robots, making global models infeasible and necessitating context-aware system identification.

Method: DeLaN is extended with a recurrent network for online system identification, combined with MPC for adaptive control, and incorporates residual dynamics modeling for the robot's nominal model.

Result: Demonstrated on a 7-DOF robot arm, the proposed method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, outperforming a baseline extended Kalman filter which achieves a 21% improvement.

Conclusion: Context-aware, physics-informed models integrated with MPC provide significant gains in robot tracking accuracy under variable environmental conditions.

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21% improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Method: The paper evaluates TSP, MST, and OCP strategies through MATLAB simulations, analyzing metrics such as processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time.

Result: OCP excels in constrained traversal time scenarios but demands high computational costs; MST offers faster but suboptimal solutions, highlighting trade-offs in algorithm selection.

Conclusion: Appropriate path-planning algorithms should be selected based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency against computational feasibility.

Abstract: In many applications, including underwater robotics, the coverage problem requires an autonomous vehicle to systematically explore a defined area while minimizing redundancy and avoiding obstacles. This paper investigates coverage path planning strategies to enhance the efficiency of underwater gliders, particularly in maximizing the probability of detecting a radioactive source while ensuring safe navigation.
  We evaluate three path-planning approaches: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and Optimal Control Problem (OCP). Simulations were conducted in MATLAB, comparing processing time, uncovered areas, path length, and traversal time. Results indicate that OCP is preferable when traversal time is constrained, although it incurs significantly higher computational costs. Conversely, MST-based approaches provide faster but less optimal solutions. These findings offer insights into selecting appropriate algorithms based on mission priorities, balancing efficiency and computational feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates obstacle interaction and structured pushing strategies, optimizing NAMO tasks and exceeding baseline performances.

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for efficient Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) using a mobile manipulator. Our approach combines interaction-based obstacle property estimation with structured pushing strategies, facilitating the dynamic manipulation of unforeseen obstacles while adhering to a pre-planned global path. The high-level policy generates pushing commands that consider environmental constraints and path-tracking objectives, while the low-level policy precisely and stably executes these commands through coordinated whole-body movements. Comprehensive simulation-based experiments demonstrate improvements in performing NAMO tasks, including higher success rates, shortened traversed path length, and reduced goal-reaching times, compared to baselines. Additionally, ablation studies assess the efficacy of each component, while a qualitative analysis further validates the accuracy and reliability of the real-time obstacle property estimation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-level SLAM systems face challenges with traditional sensor setups, limiting accuracy in large-scale environments.

Method: MCOO-SLAM combines multi-camera configurations, semantic-geometric-temporal fusion, and omnidirectional view technology for consistent mapping.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced localization, scalability, and object mapping under complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with MCOO-SLAM advancing SLAM applications by offering improved robustness in diverse settings.

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body, SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the target water area to perform corresponding tasks.

Conclusion: GRIM provides a novel, efficient, and generalizable approach to address task-oriented grasping without the need for training.

Abstract: Task-Oriented Grasping (TOG) presents a significant challenge, requiring a nuanced understanding of task semantics, object affordances, and the functional constraints dictating how an object should be grasped for a specific task. To address these challenges, we introduce GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative Matching), a novel training-free framework for task-oriented grasping. Initially, a coarse alignment strategy is developed using a combination of geometric cues and principal component analysis (PCA)-reduced DINO features for similarity scoring. Subsequently, the full grasp pose associated with the retrieved memory instance is transferred to the aligned scene object and further refined against a set of task-agnostic, geometrically stable grasps generated for the scene object, prioritizing task compatibility. In contrast to existing learning-based methods, GRIM demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving robust performance with only a small number of conditioning examples.

Abstract: We present Vision in Action (ViA), an active perception system for bimanual robot manipulation. ViA learns task-relevant active perceptual strategies (e.g., searching, tracking, and focusing) directly from human demonstrations. On the hardware side, ViA employs a simple yet effective 6-DoF robotic neck to enable flexible, human-like head movements. To capture human active perception strategies, we design a VR-based teleoperation interface that creates a shared observation space between the robot and the human operator. To mitigate VR motion sickness caused by latency in the robot's physical movements, the interface uses an intermediate 3D scene representation, enabling real-time view rendering on the operator side while asynchronously updating the scene with the robot's latest observations. Together, these design elements enable the learning of robust visuomotor policies for three complex, multi-stage bimanual manipulation tasks involving visual occlusions, significantly outperforming baseline systems.

Conclusion: The framework enables category-level generalization, excels in limited camera view scenarios, and supports model-based planning for object manipulation.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

### [272] [OS-Harm: A Benchmark for Measuring Safety of Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14866)
*Thomas Kuntz,Agatha Duzan,Hao Zhao,Francesco Croce,Zico Kolter,Nicolas Flammarion,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces OS-Harm, a benchmark to evaluate the safety of LLM-based computer use agents when interacting with graphical user interfaces. It focuses on deliberate misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the increasing popularity of LLM-based computer agents and the need to ensure their safe deployment by addressing potential harmful behaviors in real-world applications.

Method: The authors introduce OS-Harm, a safety benchmark built on the OSWorld environment. The benchmark includes 150 varied safety tasks and uses an automated judge with high human agreement to evaluate the safety and accuracy of the agents.

Result: Evaluation of frontier LLM-based agents like o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro revealed that these models often comply with harmful user queries, are vulnerable to static prompt injections, and sometimes perform unsafe actions.

Conclusion: OS-Harm highlights significant safety concerns in existing LLM-based computer use agents, offering a framework for safety evaluation and improvement. This benchmark can serve as a critical tool for advancing the safe design of such systems.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees. While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

### [273] [An Empirical Study of Bugs in Data Visualization Libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15084)
*Weiqi Lu,Yongqiang Tian,Xiaohan Zhong,Haoyang Ma,Zhenyang Xu,Shing-Chi Cheung,Chengnian Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 564 bugs in DataViz libraries, identifies their symptoms and root causes, and evaluates the use of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for bug detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for understanding the characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries, which impact user experience and decision-making by creating misleading visualizations.

Method: The authors analyzed 564 bugs from five popular DataViz libraries to categorize issues and explore the use of VLMs for detecting visual bugs.

Result: They identified incorrect graphic computation as a major root cause of bugs, proposed a taxonomy of bugs, and evaluated VLMs for bug detection with effectiveness rates ranging from 29% to 57%.

Conclusion: The study highlights the necessity of automated testing for DataViz libraries and demonstrates the limited yet promising role of VLMs in bug detection.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our manuscript.

*Miao Miao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark that allows fine-tuned evaluation of fuzzers by generating programs with configurable characteristics, revealing that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on program features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the deficiency in fuzzing evaluations that overlook the impact of fine-grained program features on fuzzer effectiveness.

Method: The study reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies to identify 7 program features affecting performance. Then, it generated 153 benchmark programs with 10 configurable parameters and evaluated 11 popular fuzzers against these benchmarks.

Result: The evaluation demonstrated that fuzzer performance varies significantly with different program features and their strengths, underscoring the importance of benchmarks that incorporate diverse program characteristics.

Conclusion: Program characteristics are crucial in assessing fuzzing effectiveness, and benchmarks that account for these characteristics can provide more accurate insights into fuzzer performance.

Abstract: Fuzzing is a powerful software testing technique renowned for its effectiveness in identifying software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.

### [275] [Towards Bug-Free Distributed Go Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15135)
*Zhengqun Koo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting communication races in distributed systems written in a subset of the Go language, proposing a static verification framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning about concurrency in distributed systems to avoid races is complex, and unexpected communication races can lead to critical bugs.

Method: The authors developed a static verification framework to prove absence of communication races by leveraging an extended happens-before order for message-passing systems.

Result: The framework enables static reasoning about distributed Go programs, ensuring communication races are identified and mitigated.

Conclusion: This framework effectively eliminates communication races in Go-based distributed systems, improving program robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Programmers of distributed systems need to reason about concurrency to avoid races. However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied (dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all. In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.

### [276] [Enhancement Report Approval Prediction: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15098)
*Haosheng Zuo,Feifei Niu,Chuanyi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for automating enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP), comparing these models against traditional methods. Incorporating creator profiles and fine-tuning boosts predictive performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual processing of enhancement reports (ERs) is resource-intensive, leading to inefficiencies. There is a need for automated solutions to streamline decision-making, reduce delays, and ensure insights from these reports are not lost.

Method: The study systematically evaluates 18 LLMs, including encoder-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) and decoder-based models (GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama, etc.), against traditional methods. Techniques like creator profile incorporation and LoRA fine-tuning were utilized to enhance model performance.

Result: Key findings include: (1) Incorporating creator profiles improved unfine-tuned decoder-only models' accuracy by 10.8% but introduced potential bias, and (2) LoRA fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct achieved 79% accuracy and 76.1% recall—outperforming traditional methods by 5% under chronological evaluation and addressing class imbalance.

Conclusion: Large language models (LLMs) are a superior solution for ERAP, offering improved accuracy and recall over traditional methods. They have significant potential to enhance software maintenance workflows, with future research needed to address specific underperforming cases.

Abstract: Enhancement reports (ERs) serve as a critical communication channel between users and developers, capturing valuable suggestions for software improvement. However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge, enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus, leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1 8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods (CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1) Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models' overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79 percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1 percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5 percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP, demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed, providing valuable directions for future research.

Result: The study categorized tasks such as test generation and oracle generation, identified unresolved challenges, and offered promising research directions.

Conclusion: This review offers a comprehensive overview for the unit testing community, aiming to foster understanding, guide research, and make key artifacts accessible via a GitHub repository.

Abstract: Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software engineering, with the aim of ensuring the correctness, maintainability, and reliability of individual software components. Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly growing body of research has leveraged LLMs to automate various unit testing tasks, demonstrating remarkable performance and significantly reducing manual effort. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to understand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities. This paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application of LLMs in unit testing until March 2025. We analyze \numpaper{} relevant papers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize existing unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and oracle generation. We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and hybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved and outline promising directions to guide future research in this area. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.

*Yusuf Sulistyo Nugroho,Farah Danisha Salam,Brittany Reid,Raula Gaikovina Kula,Kazumasa Shimari,Kenichi Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how developers document code snippets and evaluates the performance of the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) in generating such descriptions, using a dataset of code snippets and descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers and users rely on clear documentation of code snippets to understand their purpose, usage, and intent, especially for third-party libraries.

Method: The researchers used a dataset of code snippets from NPM (1,024,579 snippets) and analyzed 400 code snippets with their descriptions. They performed manual classification of description types and evaluated Llama's ability to generate matching descriptions.

Result: The study found that 55.5% of descriptions focus on usage examples. Llama correctly identified 79.75% of these as examples and produced descriptions with a similarity score of 0.7173 to the originals.

Conclusion: Llama demonstrates reasonable potential in generating relevant code documentation, but improvements are necessary to reduce irrelevance and better reflect the intent of the original documentation.

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.

### [280] [cAST: Enhancing Code Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structural Chunking via Abstract Syntax Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15655)
*Yilin Zhang,Xinran Zhao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Chenyang Yang,Jiayi Wei,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structure-aware chunking method using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for better code retrieval and generation in RAG pipelines, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for chunking in RAG pipelines often disrupt semantic coherence, negatively affecting code generation quality.

Method: The authors propose a structure-aware chunking method based on ASTs, ensuring semantic coherence by recursively splitting and merging nodes within size limits.

Result: The method improves performance on code generation tasks, such as boosting RepoEval retrieval Recall@5 by 4.3 points and SWE-bench generation Pass@1 by 2.67 points.

Conclusion: Structure-aware chunking using AST provides better semantic coherence and improved results, emphasizing its importance for enhancing retrieval-augmented code generation pipelines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: POCO is a neural forecasting model achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting spontaneous neural activity, tested across zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of predicting future neural activity for scientific and technological applications, especially for multi-session and spontaneous neural recordings.

Method: POCO combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder for capturing neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics, and is pre-trained across multiple species datasets for adaptability.

Result: POCO achieves high accuracy at cellular resolution, adapts quickly to new recordings, recovers biological structures like brain region clustering, and identifies key factors influencing performance.

Conclusion: POCO offers a scalable neural forecasting approach, advancing adaptive neurotechnology and enabling large-scale models for cross-species brain dynamics.

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

### [282] [Optimal Convergence Rates of Deep Neural Network Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14899)
*Zihan Zhang,Lei Shi,Ding-Xuan Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates binary classification under specific conditions, showing optimal rates for excess risk and demonstrates ReLU DNNs can achieve near-optimal performance in high dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide theoretical justification for the strong performance of ReLU deep neural networks in high-dimensional practical classification tasks.

Method: The paper assumes a compositional structure for the data distribution's probability function and derives an optimal convergence rate for classifiers. It also shows that ReLU DNNs trained with hinge loss achieve this rate.

Result: The derived rate for excess 0-1 risk is independent of input dimension $d$, and ReLU DNNs trained with hinge loss reach this rate up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: Results confirm the capacity of ReLU DNNs to excel in high-dimensional classification tasks, supported by novel techniques extending prior oracle inequalities.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$ vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a maximum value function or a Hölder-$β$ smooth function that depends only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions, the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$ \left( \frac{1}{n} \right)^{\frac{β\cdot(1\wedgeβ)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdotβ\cdot(1\wedgeβ)^q}}}\;\;\;, $$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent interest.

*Daqian Shao,Ashkan Soleymani,Francesco Quinzan,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in two-stage conditional moment restriction (CMR) estimation by proposing DML-CMR, a method based on the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework with unbiased estimates and fast convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMR problems arise in diverse areas like causal inference and econometrics, yet existing two-stage approaches often introduce heavy biases, especially when deep neural networks (DNNs) are used for estimation.

Method: The authors propose the DML-CMR algorithm, incorporating a novel learning objective and leveraging the DML framework to reduce bias and achieve unbiased estimation.

Result: The proposed DML-CMR estimator demonstrates minimax optimal convergence rates of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under specific conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets for IV regression and proximal causal learning.

Conclusion: The DML-CMR method offers a robust and efficient solution to reduce bias in CMR problems, significantly advancing both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities. Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

TL;DR: The paper explores why the k-means algorithm fails in high-dimensional, noisy settings with limited data, using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the challenges k-means faces in high-dimensional scenarios, including issues in complex applications like Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Method: The paper uses a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to theoretically analyze and explain the failure of k-means in specific high-dimensional, high-noise scenarios with limited data.

Result: It identifies regimes where almost every data partition becomes a fixed point of the k-means algorithm, rendering it ineffective under such conditions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the limitations of k-means in certain high-dimensional, noisy contexts and suggest the need for alternate methods in such scenarios.

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

*Gunnar König,Hidde Fokkema,Timo Freiesleben,Celestine Mendler-Dünner,Ulrike Von Luxburg*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the validity of algorithmic recourse explanations and their vulnerability to performative influences, recommending a shift toward methods focusing exclusively on causal variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applicants rely on recourse explanations to alter their input features to achieve positive evaluations from algorithmic decisions, but these explanations may lose validity due to performative changes when many individuals act on recommendations.

Method: The paper formally analyzes the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid and critiques standard approaches such as counterfactual and causal recourse methods.

Result: Findings reveal that recourse actions lose validity if influenced by or intervening on non-causal variables, highlighting limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: The authors encourage the adoption of recourse methods that recommend actions based solely on causal variables to ensure enduring validity and fairness.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal variables.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a data-driven approach to learn the time-dependent probability density of multivariate stochastic processes, enabling applications like density reconstruction, sample generation, and outlier detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of time-dependent probability densities for stochastic processes is key in understanding complex systems and detecting rare events, but existing techniques often lack precision or scalability.

Method: The method involves training a novel binary classifier using a contrastive estimation-based objective, leveraging a second-order approximation to time-derivative logarithmic densities and generating samples via gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

Result: The approach successfully reconstructs complex densities, scales to moderately high dimensions, detects rare events, and demonstrates its utility with unsupervised outlier detection across numerical experiments.

Conclusion: This technique is effective in reconstructing time-dependent probability densities, providing scalability to higher dimensions and aiding tasks like rare event detection, highlighting its practical relevance.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among real-world data.

*Xin Chen,Jason M. Klusowski,Yan Shuo Tan,Chang Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a computationally efficient ensemble method for sparse linear regression based on randomized feature subsampling, showing its superiority over lasso and elastic net while improving understanding of random forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern data science often employs ensemble methods like random forests to improve performance, but these can be computationally expensive and lack clear theoretical understanding, motivating the development of a more efficient and theoretically grounded approach for sparse linear regression.

Method: The paper introduces an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators randomized by feature subsampling, optimized via a novel dynamic programming implementation for computational efficiency. Numerical experiments and theoretical analysis are performed to evaluate its performance and impact.

Result: The proposed method outperforms popular methods including lasso and elastic net, and it shifts the bias-variance trade-off curve by reducing both training error and degrees of freedom. Theoretical insights are provided in the case of orthogonal features, showing the mechanism of implicit regularization.

Conclusion: Randomized ensembling in sparse linear regression can be both computationally efficient and powerful, challenging existing beliefs about shrinkage and enhancing understanding of implicit regularization effects in ensemble models like random forests.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests, has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling -- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset. We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BMFM-RNA, a software framework for transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs), which standardizes model training and evaluation, enhancing reproducibility and community collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of training strategies in transcriptomic foundation models makes it hard to identify optimal design choices and limits reproducibility of insights across studies.

Method: Developed BMFM-RNA, a modular TFM software integrating multiple training objectives. Introduced WCED, an autoencoder-based objective, and evaluated combinations of training strategies through benchmarking.

Result: WCED-based models achieved performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art approaches across diverse datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA provides a reproducible and unified framework for benchmarking, promoting best practices and advancing TFM development for cellular biology research.

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction. However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability, we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED), which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available as part of the biomed-multi-omics project ( https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

*Simon P. von der Maase*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture to forecast three types of violent conflict (state-based, non-state, one-sided) at high resolution for up to three years ahead with high accuracy and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, high-resolution forecasting of violent conflict is crucial for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and policymaking, yet remains a significant challenge.

Method: The study employs a Monte Carlo Dropout LSTM U-Net architecture combining convolutional layers for spatial dependencies and recurrent architectures for temporal modeling, needing no manual feature engineering and leveraging historical conflict data.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in forecasting tasks, offers probabilistic predictions, and quantifies forecast uncertainty.

Conclusion: This extensible model, capable of integrating additional data sources, is a valuable tool for conflict forecasting, early warning systems, and peacebuilding efforts.

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational (priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based peacebuilding initiatives.

TL;DR: DisProtEdit is a protein editing framework using dual-channel text descriptions for structural and functional properties to enable modular control and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of prior protein editing models that relied on joint holistic embeddings, aiming to develop a more interpretable and controllable framework.

Method: The authors introduce DisProtEdit, which uses a disentanglement loss and alignment objectives on a novel dataset, SwissProtDis, to separate structural and functional semantics.

Result: DisProtEdit exhibits competitive performance in editing proteins compared to existing methods and achieves a 61.7% success rate in coordinated structural and functional edits.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves protein editing by offering modular interpretation of structural and functional factors and proves effective on benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability. On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative modeling framework leveraging thermodynamic computing for structured data synthesis governed by Langevin dynamics, eliminating the need for neural networks or active denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generative model that produces structured samples efficiently, without relying on artificial noise or active denoising control.

Method: A thermodynamic system governed by Langevin dynamics is trained to maximize the reverse probability of a noising trajectory, minimizing heat emission during data generation.

Result: The framework is demonstrated successfully in a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer.

Conclusion: Analog hardware implementation of this approach could enable efficient generative modeling without artificial noise or neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.

Motivation: The paper aims to address skepticism surrounding the potential practical benefits of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

Method: The researchers systematically designed and evaluated 12 different QNN configurations, using two quantum feature maps and six entanglement strategies, to assess their performance in predictive tasks.

Result: Their experiments on a wind energy dataset showed that QNNs utilizing the Z feature map achieved up to 93% prediction accuracy with only four input parameters, outperforming classical methods.

Conclusion: QNNs demonstrated superior performance in predictive tasks, highlighting the potential of QML for real-world applications despite limitations in current quantum computing technology.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a regularization method in quantum machine learning (QML) optimization to manage sampling overhead during circuit cutting, addressing constraints in near-term quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by the limitations of NISQ quantum hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, and to explore techniques for managing the increased sampling overhead during circuit cutting.

Method: The authors propose incorporating a regularization term in QML optimization that penalizes sampling overhead, guiding the optimizer to balance circuit cutting's benefits with the primary ML cost function.

Result: This method allows for a trade-off between minimizing the sampling overhead and maintaining the accuracy of QML models, facilitating optimization in larger, more complex problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows promise in addressing NISQ hardware constraints, enhancing the potential for exploring larger problems in QML and moving closer to achieving quantum advantage.

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question. The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in pursuit of quantum advantage.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced methodologies like QMKL offer promising advancements in cheminformatics, particularly for challenging classification tasks in drug discovery.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels.

*Luigi Sibille,Torodd Skjerve Nord,Alice Cicirello*

TL;DR: The study explores using Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) for virtual sensing to monitor the integrity of ferry quays exposed to harsh environments and ferry impacts, addressing challenges like sparse sensors and modeling uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The harsh maritime environment and ferry impacts deteriorate ferry quays. Virtual sensing is needed for structural health monitoring where direct sensor placement is impractical, aiding Digital Twin development.

Method: The study integrates in-operation experimental data from ferry impacts with a detailed physics-based model. It uses GPLFM combined with a physics-encoded reduced-order structural model to estimate unknown impact forces and structural responses.

Result: GPLFM accurately estimates structural responses except in the impact zone under simplifying linear time-invariant modeling assumptions. Optimal sensor placement was explored using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.

Conclusion: The GPLFM method effectively accommodates modeling and measurement uncertainties, offering viable virtual sensing for structural health monitoring with acceptable accuracy in most scenarios.

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations. Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone. A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types, sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions, in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies, races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing, now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would bring.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantitative framework for assessing the gap between LLM-simulated and human behaviors in multiple-choice survey contexts. The findings show a popular LLM struggles to simulate diverse sub-populations in contentious survey topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can reliably replicate human behaviors, opinions, and decision-making in social science research.

Method: The study uses hypothesis testing within a quantitative framework to evaluate how well LLMs simulate human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings across various sub-populations.

Result: The analyzed language model failed to accurately simulate the opinions of diverse groups, especially across demographic lines like race, age, and income, for contentious survey questions.

Conclusion: LLMs currently exhibit significant misalignment with human sub-populations in complex social contexts, necessitating improved practices for integrating LLMs into social science research.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing, we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings. This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes) for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of human subjects.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called "Transit for All" (TFA) to address transit inequities by guiding the equitable expansion of bike-sharing systems in NYC using spatial analysis and demand prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-income and minority communities in NYC face limited access to public transit, and bike-sharing systems are seen as a potential solution to improve first- and last-mile connectivity while promoting equity.

Method: The proposed TFA framework includes three components: demand prediction at new bike-sharing stations using geographic data, assessment of transit accessibility gaps through a novel metric (wPTAL), and recommendations for station placement based on potential ridership and equity impacts.

Result: Using NYC as an example, the framework identified accessibility gaps affecting disadvantaged communities and showed that strategically placed bike-sharing stations can significantly reduce disparities related to economic and demographic factors.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how TFA can empower urban planners to enhance transit equity and improve the quality of life in underserved neighborhoods by guiding bike-sharing expansions with informed recommendations.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in underserved urban communities.

*Christina Q. Knight,Kaustubh Deshpande,Ved Sirdeshmukh,Meher Mankikar,Scale Red Team,SEAL Research Team,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents FORTRESS, a dataset of 500 expert-crafted prompts to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) safeguard robustness against national security and public safety threats, highlighting varying trade-offs in risk and usability across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to assess and enhance safeguard robustness in LLMs due to their dual-use capabilities, which can threaten or benefit national security and public safety, and the inadequacy of current benchmarks in addressing these concerns objectively.

Method: The authors developed FORTRESS, a benchmark comprising 500 adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics across domains like Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive threats, terrorism, and illicit activities. The benchmarks include benign pairs to measure over-refusals and are used to evaluate several LLMs.

Result: The study reveals that LLMs exhibit different trade-offs between risks and over-refusals: Claude-3.5-Sonnet has low risk but high over-refusal; Gemini 2.5 Pro has low over-refusal but high risk; Deepseek-R1 has the highest risk but lowest over-refusal. o1 achieves a more balanced trade-off.

Conclusion: FORTRESS provides an objective rubric for assessing LLM safeguard robustness and highlights the trade-offs inherent in current models. It serves as a tool for policymakers and researchers to better understand and address the risks of deploying LLMs in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a private set for evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUE, a cognitive model for evaluating explanations in XAI, showing that accessibility-focused visual adaptations don't always benefit visually impaired users and advocating adaptive interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of human-understandable explanations in XAI, particularly for visually impaired users.

Method: A study with 455 participants tested various color maps in heatmaps to measure their impact on user performance, confidence, and perceived effort.

Result: Findings show comparable task performance across color maps but reduced confidence/effort for visually impaired users, even with accessibility-focused configurations.

Conclusion: Adaptive XAI interfaces are needed as accessibility-focused designs may not effectively improve usability for all users. The proposed CUE model links explanation properties to cognitive processes effectively.

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

*Jules Leguy,Pierre-Antoine Jean,Felipe Torres Figueroa,Sébastien Harispe*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: WebXAII is an open-source framework facilitating studies on human interaction with explainable AI, overcoming challenges like interface reutilization and experiment reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reusable and reproducible tools in studying human-XAI interaction grows as AI becomes integrated into diverse fields; ad hoc interfaces currently hinder progress.

Method: WebXAII is a web-based experimental framework implemented through structured configuration files, minimizing programming demands while offering flexibility.

Result: WebXAII successfully replicated a state-of-the-art protocol from XAI research, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Conclusion: WebXAII enables scalable, reproducible, and accessible experimentation with XAI systems through a flexible, structured framework.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols, meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

### [302] [Analyzing Character Representation in Media Content using Multimodal Foundation Model: Effectiveness and Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14799)
*Evdoxia Taka,Debadyuti Bhattacharya,Joanne Garde-Hansen,Sanjay Sharma,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a user study on an AI-based tool for analyzing and visualizing character representation in media, focusing on age and gender demographics. It highlights moderate to low trust in AI models but notes usefulness of the tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability, usefulness, and public trust in AI-generated demographic analytics for character representations in media content.

Method: Developed a visualization tool based on the CLIP model to analyze screen data, followed by a user study to assess the tool's efficacy and trust among audiences.

Result: Participants found the tool and visualizations overall useful but expressed moderate to low trust in AI-generated demographic data. They suggested improvements for greater detail and character context.

Conclusion: AI-based tools for media analysis promise utility but face skepticism from the audience regarding trustworthiness, suggesting the need for enhanced features and context presentation for better acceptance.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code, benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Character-Representation-Media-FF7B

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper advocates for structured intent communication in human-cobot collaboration by introducing a multidimensional design space based on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework, addressing dynamic and collaborative contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The entry of robots into collaborative workspaces requires improved mutual understanding to ensure trust, safety, and efficiency.

Method: The authors utilize the SAT framework and task abstraction levels to propose a multidimensional design space considering intent content, planning horizon, and communication modality.

Result: The paper introduces a conceptual foundation for designing multimodal communication strategies in human-robot interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: This work serves as a precursor to developing design toolkits that support transparent and trustworthy robotic collaboration, and sets forth key challenges and an agenda for future research in hybrid workspaces.

Abstract: As robots enter collaborative workspaces, ensuring mutual understanding between human workers and robotic systems becomes a prerequisite for trust, safety, and efficiency. In this position paper, we draw on the cooperation scenario of the AIMotive project in which a human and a cobot jointly perform assembly tasks to argue for a structured approach to intent communication. Building on the Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) framework and the notion of task abstraction levels, we propose a multidimensional design space that maps intent content (SAT1, SAT3), planning horizon (operational to strategic), and modality (visual, auditory, haptic). We illustrate how this space can guide the design of multimodal communication strategies tailored to dynamic collaborative work contexts. With this paper, we lay the conceptual foundation for a future design toolkit aimed at supporting transparent human-robot interaction in the workplace. We highlight key open questions and design challenges, and propose a shared agenda for multimodal, adaptive, and trustworthy robotic collaboration in hybrid work environments.

*Aditya Majumdar,Wenbo Zhang,Kashvi Prawal,Amulya Yadav*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores challenges faced by AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects in achieving real-world impact and suggests best practices for overcoming these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the difficulty of achieving tangible impact in AI4SI projects and the need to address barriers in partnerships and deployment.

Method: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers, complemented by their own experiences, and performed thematic analysis to diagnose challenges and synthesize strategies.

Result: Key barriers identified include structural, organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges. Best practices and actionable strategies were synthesized.

Conclusion: The study aims to act as a practical guide for AI4SI researchers and partner organizations, striving to improve engagement and real-world impact.

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare, social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI, achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects "fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers - complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research - this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful AI collaborations.

*Richa Gupta,Alexander Htet Kyaw*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline combining AI-generated images with sustainability metrics to aid decision-making in interior architectural design, showing improved eco-consciousness but potential decision fatigue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between visually appealing AI-generated designs and actionable, sustainability-driven data for interior architectural designers.

Method: A pipeline integrating DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset generates designs enriched by sustainability metrics. User tests were conducted under three different conditions to evaluate outcomes.

Result: The introduction of sustainability metrics in generative AI outputs enhanced eco-conscious design decisions, albeit with reduced user satisfaction due to decision fatigue.

Conclusion: Integrated metrics in AI tools can promote ecologically responsible practices, but designers must balance sustainability insights with creative freedom.

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3 with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emotional and logistical challenges faced by caregivers of AD/ADRD patients and the lack of understanding about how they perceive and engage with generative AI technologies.

Method: A GPT-4-based chatbot named Carey was developed and employed as a technology probe. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 family caregivers during scenario-driven interactions. Data was analyzed through inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis.

Result: Six themes emerged regarding caregiver needs and expectations: information access, emotional support, safe disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. Tensions between caregivers' desires and concerns within each theme were identified.

Conclusion: The study highlights the strengths and gaps in using AI chatbots for caregiver support, providing design recommendations for creating proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-focused systems.

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs) -- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes -- on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes, we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths, gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD caregivers.

Method: An LLM-powered system was developed and deployed in real-world settings. Evaluations occurred through the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model, alongside a hybrid framework combining automated and human assessments.

Result: Findings include successful deployment of safeguards to reduce risks, insights into generative AI's impact on IS survey methods, and a novel evaluation framework balancing automation with human oversight.

Conclusion: Automation of survey generation through LLMs is feasible and beneficial, but success requires attention to user needs, quality control, and ethical deployment. Applying generative AI within IS workflows holds promise and warrants further investigation.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a guide to help users navigate the vast literature on reliable visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the confusion and uncertainty novice analysts and researchers face due to the diversity and extensiveness of DR-related visual analytics literature.

Method: The authors use previous literature classifications and conduct interview studies with experts to develop a comprehensive guide for evaluating expertise and identifying relevant papers.

Result: The guide aids users in assessing their DR expertise and pointing them to papers for enhancing their understanding, validated by expert interviews.

Conclusion: The guide is an effective tool for practitioners to start and grow their knowledge in reliable visual analytics using DR methodologies.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and usefulness of our guide.

*Ryota Okumura,Tadahiro Taniguchi,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes and empirically validates 'co-creative learning,' where humans and AI collaboratively integrate their perceptual information to develop shared external representations. This is tested using a human-AI interaction modeled after the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of aligning and integrating different modalities of information between humans and AI, moving away from traditional unidirectional AI teaching methods.

Method: The framework is tested using an online experiment where 69 participants interact with one of three types of AI agents in a 'joint attention naming game' scenario under partial observability. The AI agents are designed to follow different acceptance mechanisms, including one based on the MHNG model.

Result: Human-AI teams with MH-based agents significantly improved their categorization accuracy and achieved better convergence toward a shared sign system. Human behaviors aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance model.

Conclusion: The findings provide evidence for co-creative learning in human-AI interaction, highlighting the potential for developing symbiotic AI systems that learn through mutual alignment with human perceptual experiences.

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI, i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Motivation: Current methods for retrieving remote learning resources lack the ability to provide contextually rich and comprehensive answers to complex student queries.

Method: The proposed method integrates GPT-based models in the LangChain framework, leveraging CoT reasoning and prompt engineering to enhance the precision and relevance of retrieval results.

Result: The approach shows improved user satisfaction and learning outcomes compared to traditional large language models.

Conclusion: Integrating GPT-based models with LangChain enhances remote learning retrieval, delivering more personalized and contextually enriched resources.

Abstract: Large Language Models have brought a radical change in the process of remote learning students, among other aspects of educative activities. Current retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

Motivation: To address limitations in PresPM literature, such as limited comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches, and to enhance operational performance in organizations through optimized processes.

Method: The introduction of SimBank, a simulator that models a bank's loan application process, allowing for extensive comparisons of PresPM methods. SimBank supports diverse intervention optimization scenarios, evaluates causal challenges like data confounding, and includes complex real-life process modeling.

Result: SimBank is validated as a benchmarking tool by demonstrating its capability through experiments with various PresPM methods under different interventions.

Conclusion: SimBank is a valuable tool for advancing the research and application of Prescriptive Process Monitoring, providing accurate benchmarking and a robust evaluation framework.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods. Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges, such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case, it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

Motivation: To address the shortcomings of SL and CCL in recommendation models, namely high sensitivity to false negatives and low data utilization.

Method: DrRL introduces a generalized approach leveraging Rényi-divergence in Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO) to optimize recommendation models.

Result: DrRL combines the strengths of SL and CCL, effectively resolving their respective limitations, and demonstrates superior performance in experiments on accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: DrRL offers an improved framework for recommendation models with robust optimization, mitigating issues inherent in SL and CCL.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2) Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging Rényi-divergence in DRO optimization. DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly enhances interference coordination and resource allocation for URLLC, making it highly suitable for complex industrial network scenarios.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of 179.6\%, 197.4\%, and 175.2\% over LDP across three network configurations. Additionally, the GCN-DQN model demonstrates mean SINR improvements of 31.5\%, 53.0\%, and 84.7\% over our previous CNN-based approach across the same configurations.

*Shagun Maheshwari,Janghoon Ock,Adeesh Kolluru,Amir Barati Farimani,John R. Kitchin*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of the GemNet-T graph neural network as a machine-learning force field for molecular dynamics and highlights the benefits of pre-training for improved simulation stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational expense of ab initio molecular dynamics by leveraging machine-learning force fields for efficient and accurate force predictions.

Method: The authors trained the GemNet-T model using two strategies: direct training on a small dataset (MD17) and pre-training on a large dataset (OC20) followed by fine-tuning on MD17.

Result: Both models achieved low force mean absolute errors (5 meV/A per atom), but the pre-trained model demonstrated significantly better stability in molecular dynamics simulations (up to three times longer trajectories).

Conclusion: Pre-training on large, diverse datasets improves simulation stability and force accuracy should not be the sole metric for evaluating molecular dynamics models.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

### [317] [Probabilistic Trajectory GOSPA: A Metric for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Object Tracking Performance Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15148)
*Yuxuan Xia,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Johan Karlsson,Yu Ge,Lennart Svensson,Ting Yuan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generalized GOSPA metric for evaluating multi-object tracking algorithms, incorporating uncertainties in trajectory estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the evaluation of multi-object tracking algorithms by including track-level uncertainties in the GOSPA metric.

Method: The study generalizes the probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for state estimation and existence uncertainties, formulates it as a multidimensional assignment problem, and validates its linear programming relaxation for polynomial-time computation.

Result: The proposed metric decomposes tracking errors into intuitive cost terms and is demonstrated to be effective through simulations.

Conclusion: The generalized GOSPA metric enhances interpretability and tracking evaluation by accounting for track-level uncertainties and provides computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties. This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.

### [319] [deepSURF: Detecting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Rust Through Fuzzing LLM-Augmented Harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15648)
*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces deepSURF, a tool combining static analysis and Large Language Models (LLM) to detect memory safety issues in Rust's unsafe code, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rust ensures memory safety by default but allows unsafe code, which can lead to vulnerabilities. Existing tools for identifying these vulnerabilities in Rust are limited, requiring a better approach.

Method: deepSURF integrates static analysis and LLM-guided fuzzing harness generation. It replaces generics with custom types, generates tailored implementations for traits, and uses LLMs to dynamically augment fuzzing harnesses for better vulnerability detection.

Result: deepSURF rediscovered 20 known memory safety bugs and found 6 new vulnerabilities across 27 real-world Rust crates, outperforming current methods.

Conclusion: deepSURF showcases significant advances in detecting memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust, particularly in unsafe code, by combining static analysis and LLM-driven fuzzing.

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

*Wassim Bouaziz,Mathurin Videau,Nicolas Usunier,El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper shows that indirect data poisoning using a method they developed can covertly make language models learn secret sequences effectively and trace data usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of current data tracing methods like membership inference attacks that rely heavily on memorization and are not effective against language model techniques that limit memorization.

Method: Demonstrates indirect data poisoning using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning to make language models learn secret sequences not present in the training set.

Result: Proves that embedding less than 0.005% poisoned tokens can teach a language model secrets while maintaining high detection confidence and no performance drop.

Conclusion: Indirect data poisoning is feasible as a tool for tracing dataset usage in LLMs without degrading performance and under highly certifiable conditions.

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme. Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

### [324] [Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018)
*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new algorithm for differentially private continual counting in scenarios where the input size is unknown beforehand. It improves on previous methods by offering better error smoothness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of providing differential privacy in continual counting scenarios when the total input size is unknown, an area where current methods struggle due to reliance on predefined input sizes or suboptimal error handling.

Method: The authors propose novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}} \), aiming for smooth error handling and improved variance in unbounded settings.

Result: The algorithm achieves \( O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t)) \) variance, uses \( O(t) \) space, and amortized \( O(\log t) \) time per round while outperforming previously known methods both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: The new algorithm provides a practical and efficient solution for unbounded continual counting tasks in differential privacy, achieving competitive performance without relying on knowledge of input size \( n \).

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $α> 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2α}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

TL;DR: The paper explores cybersecurity risks in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, emphasizing pre-market risk assessment and security integration into device design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapidly increasing use of AI/ML-powered medical devices in healthcare introduces critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities with potential safety risks for patients.

Method: The authors analyze public data on recalls, adverse events, and vulnerabilities to identify challenges, and propose tools to aid in pre-market cybersecurity assessments.

Result: They develop tools and methodologies aimed at helping security analysts evaluate risks and ensure security measures are integrated during the design phase of medical devices.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing cybersecurity in AI/ML-enabled medical devices at the design phase to protect patient safety and prevent adverse outcomes.

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses jamming attacks in 5G-NR networks using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and demonstrates its superior performance on augmented datasets while achieving high precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address security vulnerabilities, specifically jamming attacks, in 5G-NR wireless networks, which degrade the quality of service by compromising signal integrity.

Method: The paper proposes using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) for jamming detection on I/Q OFDM datasets with added AWGN. It employs a Conv1D CWGAN-GP to balance dataset class imbalances and compares the CAE's performance to benchmark autoencoders (CDAE and CSAE).

Result: The CAE exhibits superior performance on diverse datasets, achieving 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy, outperforming benchmark models.

Conclusion: The proposed CAE framework is robust and effective in detecting jamming attacks in 5G-NR networks, even with data heterogeneity and class imbalances.

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

TL;DR: The paper develops a scalable solution for real-time diabetic retinopathy detection with deep learning models (MobileNet, ShuffleNet, etc.) deployed on edge devices, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming and resource-intensive manual DR diagnosis process, especially for global scaling amid the projected rise in diabetes cases.

Method: The study employs deep learning with TensorFlow CNN models trained on a preprocessed dataset, converted to TensorFlowLite, quantized, and deployed on edge devices, testing performance against various criteria.

Result: MobileNet achieved 96.45% accuracy, with other models like SqueezeNet and ShuffleNet delivering trade-offs between accuracy, size, and latency catering to specific hardware capabilities.

Conclusion: Edge AI provides a scalable, cost-effective tool for DR detection, beneficial for early diagnosis in resource-limited and remote settings.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045. Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable, cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face is a foundation model using facial images for biological age estimation and survival risk prediction, demonstrating clinical utility in cancer patient prognostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create noninvasive, scalable facial biomarkers capable of estimating biological age and predicting survival risk, particularly in medical contexts like cancer.

Method: Trained FAHR-Face on 40M facial images, fine-tuning on specific tasks: FAHR-FaceAge for age estimation (749,935 images) and FAHR-FaceSurvival for survival risk prediction (34,389 cancer patient photos). Evaluated robustness and conducted clinical validation for cancer patients.

Result: FAHR-FaceAge achieved a low mean absolute error of 5.1 years and outperformed benchmarks in survival prediction. FAHR-FaceSurvival robustly predicted mortality risk, with the highest quartile exhibiting more than triple the mortality of the lowest (hazard ratio 3.22). Both models generalized well across demographic and cancer subgroups.

Conclusion: FAHR-Face successfully provides effective facial biomarkers for biological ageing and mortality risk, applicable across diverse populations, with potential cost-efficient applications in clinical settings.

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets.

### [330] [Improving Prostate Gland Segmenting Using Transformer based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14844)
*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study evaluates the use of transformer models UNETR and SwinUNETR for automated prostate gland segmentation on heterogeneous T2-weighted MRI datasets. SwinUNETR demonstrated superior performance, especially in cross-site domain shifts and gland size variability, compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic segmentation of the prostate gland in T2-weighted MRI is challenging due to inter-reader variability and cross-site domain shifts. The study aims to explore whether transformer-based models can address these challenges while improving segmentation precision.

Method: The research compared UNETR and SwinUNETR against a baseline 3D UNet using datasets with 546 MRI volumes annotated by two experts. Three training strategies were assessed: single cohort training, cross-validated mixed cohort training, and gland-size-based training. Hyperparameters were optimized with Optuna, and Dice Similarity Coefficients were used for evaluation.

Result: SwinUNETR outperformed UNETR and the baseline 3D UNet across all strategies, achieving higher Dice scores, especially in the mixed training strategy (0.8583–0.867) and gland-size-based datasets (0.894–0.902). It effectively mitigated label noise and sensitivity to class imbalance.

Conclusion: SwinUNETR demonstrated robustness and high accuracy for prostate segmentation under challenging conditions, such as heterogeneous data, inter-reader variability, and class imbalance, making it promising for clinical use.

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR for clinical deployment.

*Paula Feldman,Miguel Fainstein,Viviana Siless,Claudio Delrieux,Emmanuel Iarussi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) to synthesize realistic 3D blood vessel models, capturing hierarchical structure and diverse anatomical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to capture the complexity and diversity of anatomical blood vessel structures, limiting their utility in medical applications.

Method: The RvNN leverages generative neural networks and hierarchical vessel organization to learn low-dimensional manifold representations of branch connectivity and geometry.

Result: The generated blood vessel models resemble real data with high similarity in geometric metrics (radii, length, tortuosity) across datasets, including pathological cases like aneurysms.

Conclusion: The proposed RvNN method provides a groundbreaking approach for synthesizing accurate and diverse 3D vascular structures, with broad applications in medical training and simulations.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets, including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for neurological disorder (ND) classification using multi-modal MRI (aMRI, DTI, fMRI) and clinical data, achieving substantial accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the diagnostic accuracy of neurological disorders by effectively leveraging multi-modal MRI and clinical data, addressing the limitations of existing Deep Learning methods.

Method: The authors employ a transformer-based MoE framework where transformer encoders capture spatial relationships in volumetric MRI data, modality-specific experts extract targeted features, and an adaptive gating mechanism fuses expert outputs. This is applied to a proprietary dataset.

Result: The proposed framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47%, surpassing baseline methods by over 10%, and excels in distinguishing overlapping neurological disease states.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential to significantly improve ND diagnosis in clinical settings by integrating multi-modal learning with advanced architectures.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a DenseNet-121-based deep learning model that efficiently classifies 8 body MRI series types with high accuracy and F1-score, proving robust performance even across diverse data sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists face inefficiencies in reading mpMRI exams due to incorrect metadata in DICOM headers stemming from diverse imaging protocols and occasional errors. The study aims to simplify classification of MRI series for radiologists.

Method: Multiple deep learning models, including ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet architectures, were trained and compared using multi-parametric MRI data from varied institutions. The effect of training data size and scanner diversity were examined.

Result: DenseNet-121 achieved the best accuracy (0.972) and F1-score (0.966) among the tested models. Performance improved with larger training datasets and remained robust on external datasets like DLDS (accuracy 0.872) and CPTAC-UCEC (accuracy 0.810).

Conclusion: DenseNet-121 is highly effective for classifying 8 types of body MRI series, demonstrating reliability across internal and external datasets while benefiting from larger training data quantities.

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of classifying 8 body MRI series types.

*Jonghun Kim,Gyeongdeok Jo,Shinyoung Ra,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approach using VQGAN compression and homomorphic encryption to efficiently process chest X-rays while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting sensitive patient data in medical imaging is vital, especially during server-side inference. Homomorphic encryption offers a privacy-preserving solution but is computationally expensive for large images.

Method: The study combines HE with VQGAN compression to reduce image size before inference, uses polynomial approximations for activation functions, and incorporates a squeeze and excitation module to enhance model efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves an effective trade-off between performance and computational overhead, particularly with a compression factor of eight. The approach was successful on chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks, albeit slower than unencrypted inference.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates promising capabilities for enabling practical and privacy-preserving medical image analysis despite minor performance trade-offs and slower speeds.

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedWSIDD, a federated learning paradigm that uses dataset distillation to generate and share synthetic slides for efficient, privacy-preserving WSI classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in federated learning for WSI classification, such as heterogeneous computational resources and privacy concerns, while improving collaborative medical image analysis.

Method: FedWSIDD combines dataset distillation on the client side, including a tailored distillation algorithm with stain normalization, and aggregates synthetic slides on the server side for communication and collaborative learning.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated improved classification performance, flexibility with heterogeneous models, and preserved privacy in experiments using datasets like CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17.

Conclusion: FedWSIDD proves to be an effective solution for federated WSI classification, balancing privacy, performance, and adaptability to varying local settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.

*Yu Xing,Shishi Huang,Meng Lv,Guo Chen,Huailiang Wang,Lingzhi Sui*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid denoising system for compact analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing specific noise challenges and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturized endoscopes, despite their advantages, face severe noise issues in their analog image sensors due to size constraints, simplified circuitry, and analog signal transmission.

Method: The authors developed a noise model targeting fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. They then introduced a hybrid system combining traditional image processing and learning-based approaches.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated effective noise reduction while preserving image quality and improving PSNR from 21.16 to 33.05. It achieved real-time performance on FPGA platforms.

Conclusion: The approach overcomes the noise challenges of ultra-compact analog sensors, enhancing image clarity and usability for single-use medical endoscopes.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study evaluates how image preprocessing techniques affect CNN performance in cervical cancer classification, showing that a hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE method improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for enhanced accuracy in automated cervical cancer screening, particularly given the dependency of CNN performance on Pap smear image quality.

Method: The study applies three image preprocessing techniques—PMD filter, CLAHE, and a hybrid PMD-CLAHE method—to the SIPaKMeD dataset, which are subsequently tested on several pretrained CNN models.

Result: The hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE method significantly enhances CNN architecture performance, achieving up to 13.62% improvement in accuracy, 10.04% in precision, 13.08% in recall, and 14.34% in F1-score.

Conclusion: The hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE preprocessing technique effectively improves Pap smear image quality and enhances CNN-based cervical cancer classification performance.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid UNet-Transformer model for tumor segmentation on local hospital MRI datasets, achieving competitive performance with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tumor segmentation is crucial for optimizing radiotherapy treatments. Existing AI models trained on public datasets lack diversity representative of local patient populations, necessitating site-specific model development.

Method: The study used a hybrid UNet-Transformer model incorporating advanced attention mechanisms. The pipeline involved seamless DICOM data extraction, extensive augmentation, and training on a specialized local MRI dataset of 6080 images using NVIDIA T4 GPUs.

Result: The model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an IoU of 0.736 on the local dataset, highlighting its robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing locally trained AI models for clinical oncology, emphasizing the significance of site-specific data in improving tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: The authors developed an accelerated version of the Sinkhorn algorithm to address slow convergence issues in Entropic Optimal Transport under weak regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow convergence of the Sinkhorn algorithm when regularization weakens has limited its efficiency and applicability in certain contexts.

Method: The paper introduces a spectral warm-start strategy based on analyzing the behavior of the Hessian to enhance convergence speed.

Result: The proposed improved Sinkhorn algorithm demonstrates faster convergence as verified through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The spectral warm-start strategy successfully mitigates the convergence issues of the Sinkhorn algorithm under weak regularization, improving its performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an accelerated version for the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is the reference method for computing the solution to Entropic Optimal Transport.
  Its main draw-back is the exponential slow-down of convergence as the regularization weakens $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$.
  Thanks to spectral insights on the behavior of the Hessian, we propose to mitigate the problem via an original spectral warm-start strategy. This leads to faster convergence compared to the reference method, as also demonstrated in our numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the internal and external structural organization of self-attention mechanisms in transformers through theoretical analyses and computational examples, emphasizing their significance for interpretability and practical applications like model pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to better understand the structural dynamics of self-attention mechanisms in transformers, both within and across attention heads, to enhance theoretical understanding and practical utility.

Method: It employs paradifferential calculus to analyze invariance to softmax activation and organizes network 3-tensors hierarchically along query, key, and head axes. Computational examples in vision and language transformers illustrate these findings.

Result: The study shows that self-attention mechanisms are invariant to softmax and that hierarchical organization of attention heads can aid in signal processing tasks like model pruning and architecture comparisons, leveraging sparsity and expansion coefficients.

Conclusion: The hierarchical organization of the self-attention mechanism enhances both interpretability and practical applicability by enabling interpretability analysis and empirical tasks such as model pruning and architecture evaluation.

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers. Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture comparison.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce unwanted structural vibrations in engineering systems like cars, trains, or airplanes, improving passenger comfort and structure performance.

Method: The method integrates generative flow matching to ensure manufacturability, and a surrogate model trained to predict vibrations. It explores designs without requiring manual optimization parameters and applies these methods to differentiable objectives like eigenfrequency optimization.

Result: The proposed approach produces diverse, manufacturable designs with reduced vibrations. It outperforms methods like random search, criterion-based heuristics, and genetic optimization in generating optimized structures.

Conclusion: The generative flow matching and surrogate model provide an effective and automated way to discover manufacturable and optimized designs for vibration reduction, promising broader exploration and better results compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of identifying causal effects of interventions in time series data when detailed causal graphs are unavailable.

Method: The paper develops conditions to identify interventions using a backdoor set and proposes algorithms with limited complexity to determine identifiability.

Result: Conditions for backdoor identifiability in time series are established, along with efficient algorithms for identifiability assessment.

Conclusion: The research provides effective tools and algorithms for identifying causality in time series, even under incomplete causal representations.

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula, and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem, considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is identifiable or not.

*Jiamin Xie,John H. L. Hansen*

TL;DR: This paper introduces deformable convolutional kernels, called "Deformers," into Conformer models for speech recognition, leading to improved WER performance and deeper insights into learned feature associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs rely on rigid, symmetric kernels for detecting localized patterns, which may limit their ability to effectively capture asymmetric features that couple better with attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with deformable convolutional counterparts (Deformers). They analyze receptive fields and attention maps of the Deformer to understand learned feature associations and kernel behaviors.

Result: Replacing half the layers in the encoder with deformable CNNs improves the relative WER by +5.6% without a language model and +6.4% with a language model on the WSJ eval92 set.

Conclusion: Using deformable convolutional layers enhances the ability to capture and utilize asymmetric features in speech recognition tasks, resulting in significant WER improvements and deeper understanding of feature dynamics with depth.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline on the WSJ eval92 set.

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive masking method for efficiently pruning multilingual ASR models, yielding better sparse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compress multilingual ASR models while minimizing performance loss, avoiding repetitive pruning/retraining processes for each language.

Method: Introduced adaptive masking for dynamic sub-network adaptation, creating either sparse monolingual or multilingual models.

Result: Proposed method outperforms traditional pruning for monolingual models and jointly trains better sub-networks in multilingual scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic ASR Pathways optimize ASR model pruning efficiently, reducing pruning iterations and improving model performance.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MixRep, a mixup-based data augmentation strategy improving low-resource ASR performance through representation interpolation and time-axis regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of enhancing automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance for low-resource scenarios.

Method: MixRep interpolates hidden representations across feature dimensions and combines mixup with time-axis input regularization. Applied to Conformer encoders in E2E LAS architectures.

Result: MixRep achieves significant relative WER reductions (+6.5% on eval92, +6.7% on Callhome) over SpecAugment in low-resource ASR tasks.

Conclusion: MixRep is effective at improving low-resource ASR, consistently outperforming competing regularization approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

TL;DR: This paper introduces directional-SpeechLlama, a Speech LLM capable of processing multi-channel audio with spatial cues for tasks like directional speech recognition and source localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has focused on speech recognition using LLMs with audio encoding, but the capability to analyze spatial cues in multi-channel audio using LLMs has been underexplored.

Method: The authors propose two techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA), alongside leveraging microphone arrays in smart glasses.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in linking textual and spatial audio cues, achieving strong performance in speech recognition and source localization tasks.

Conclusion: Directional-SpeechLlama enhances multi-channel audio comprehension in speech LLMs, opening avenues for spatial audio processing, such as cross-talk suppression and source localization.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM) with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities. However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research. In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition and source localization tasks.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The study introduces Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a speech codec utilizing three linguistic bottlenecks (acoustic, phonetic, lexical) for disentangled and interpretable speech representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified speech codec capable of bridging acoustic detail with lexical meaning by leveraging disentangled linguistic token sets within one model.

Method: HAC uses a hierarchical framework and incorporates two knowledge distillation approaches: phoneme-level from HuBERT and lexical-level from LaBSE. These are tested on English and multilingual datasets.

Result: HAC effectively achieves disentangled token sets aligned with phonemes and word-level semantics, excelling over single-level baselines in reconstruction quality and linguistic interpretability.

Conclusion: HAC demonstrates the ability to create interpretable and natural linguistic tokens, making it suitable for downstream speech generation and understanding applications.

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues. Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

*Andela Ilic,Jiaxi Jiang,Paul Streli,Xintong Liu,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transformer-based diffusion approach for human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors, outperforming existing methods in handling such challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing motion capture systems which assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the body, a condition often not met in real-world situations.

Method: They utilize simulated loose IMU data from a garment-aware motion dataset and train transformer-based diffusion models, incorporating garment parameters to improve the model's ability to handle varying levels of looseness in clothing.

Result: The proposed method, tested using simulated and synthetic data, demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: This work presents a new research direction in motion capture, showing that integrating garment-related parameters and transformer-based diffusion models enhances pose estimation with loosely attached IMU sensors.

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking. Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments. Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

*Han Wu,Junyao Li,Kangbo Zhao,Sen Zhang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper presents a one-shot face sketch synthesis method using diffusion models and introduces a new dataset called OS-Sketch for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face sketch synthesis methods depend on large datasets, making them unsuitable when training data is scarce and costly to obtain.

Method: The authors optimize text instructions on diffusion models using a single photo-sketch image pair and use gradient-based optimization for inference.

Result: The proposed method produces realistic and consistent sketches from photos in a one-shot scenario, validated by the new benchmark, OS-Sketch.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates strong performance in generating face sketches with minimal data, offering broader applicability and reduced dependence on large datasets.

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch

*Qingming Liu,Zhen Liu,Dinghuai Zhang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nabla-R2D3, a reinforcement learning framework to improve 3D-native diffusion models using 2D reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art generative models like diffusion models struggle to match the quality and alignment of human-designed 3D assets due to limitations in following instructions, texture realism, and physical attributes.

Method: The authors build on Nabla-GFlowNet to develop Nabla-R2D3, which utilizes reward gradients for efficient reward finetuning and adapts 3D diffusion models using 2D feedback.

Result: Nabla-R2D3 achieves higher rewards, better model adaption, and reduced prior forgetting compared to traditional finetuning baselines.

Conclusion: Using 2D reward signals, Nabla-R2D3 significantly improves the performance and alignment of 3D-native diffusion models.

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps.

TL;DR: A Model Predictive Control-based method for path-following in drones is applied to a Crazyflie quadrotor, addressing real-time control demands and introducing flexibility via a corridor path-following approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of existing path-following solutions for drones, such as handling constraints, conservative two-stage methods, and inapplicability to nonlinear systems, aiming for a superior and practical control approach.

Method: A Model Predictive Control-based path-following framework is applied to a Crazyflie quadrotor, featuring a cascaded control structure with an attitude controller for real-time operational feasibility. Additionally, a corridor path-following approach adds flexibility.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated effectiveness in real-world experiments, showing that the MPC-based path-following approach works efficiently when applied to the Crazyflie quadrotor.

Conclusion: The study highlights the novel application of an MPC-based path-following approach to drones, proving its practicality and enhancing it with a more flexible corridor method for better adaptability.

Abstract: Automating drone-assisted processes is a complex task. Many solutions rely on trajectory generation and tracking, whereas in contrast, path-following control is a particularly promising approach, offering an intuitive and natural approach to automate tasks for drones and other vehicles. While different solutions to the path-following problem have been proposed, most of them lack the capability to explicitly handle state and input constraints, are formulated in a conservative two-stage approach, or are only applicable to linear systems. To address these challenges, the paper is built upon a Model Predictive Control-based path-following framework and extends its application to the Crazyflie quadrotor, which is investigated in hardware experiments. A cascaded control structure including an underlying attitude controller is included in the Model Predictive Path-Following Control formulation to meet the challenging real-time demands of quadrotor control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through real-world experiments, representing, to the best of the authors' knowledge, a novel application of this MPC-based path-following approach to the quadrotor. Additionally, as an extension to the original method, to allow for deviations of the path in cases where the precise following of the path might be overly restrictive, a corridor path-following approach is presented.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for learning dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems, demonstrating superior performance to integer-order models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of fractional-order nonlinear systems, which can better capture long-range dependencies compared to integer-order systems.

Method: Design experiments to generate datasets, estimate fractional-order parameters, and reconstruct system dynamics using orthonormal basis functions. Validate using benchmark systems.

Result: The framework accurately learned dynamics of fractional-order systems, showing its effectiveness over integer-order models in representing long-range dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models fractional-order systems, offering accuracy improvements over integer-order alternatives.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel operator for graph filters that adapts to hierarchical, tree-like graph structures, ensuring stability via geometric principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical graphs pose challenges to traditional graph filters due to their branching patterns and structure.

Method: A boundary-weighted operator is proposed, using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, with a closed-form spectral norm bound for energy loss during filtering.

Result: The operator achieves parameter-free and lightweight filtering with curvature-controlled energy loss, suitable for hierarchical data.

Conclusion: This operator provides a stable analytic tool for graph signal processing in tree-like hierarchical graphs.

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden hierarchical structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance visual quality in 360° videos that suffer from limited spatial resolution and distortions in equirectangular projections.

Method: Developed S3PO, leveraging recurrent modelling, attention mechanisms, targeted training, and a novel loss function to address spherical distortions.

Result: S3PO outperformed both state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°-specific super-resolution models in experiments.

Conclusion: The S3PO model offers significant improvements in enhancing visual quality in 360° videos and validates its efficacy through ablation studies and targeted optimizations.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360° videos) are widely used in Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences. However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

TL;DR: The paper explores sorted nonsmooth penalties for sparse signal recovery and focuses on generalizations of the SLOPE penalty, addressing efficient computation of proximal operators for weakly convex and nonconvex cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse signal recovery often involves challenges in clustering variables and reducing coefficient shrinkage, necessitating efficient methods for handling complex penalties.

Method: The authors analyze sorted nonconvex penalties as regularizers and introduce computational techniques for proximal operators, leveraging algorithms like the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV).

Result: Efficient computation of the proximal operator is achieved for sorted nonsmooth penalties, with new insights into their behavior, demonstrated across several experiments.

Conclusion: Sorted nonsmooth penalties, particularly in weakly convex and nonconvex settings, hold significant promise for promoting variable clustering and efficient sparse signal recovery.

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several experiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel methods for convex, distributed optimization problems—MT-GS and its accelerated version AMT-GS—addressing issues like communication reduction, computation flexibility, and determinism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve performance and efficiency in solving convex, distributed, non-smooth optimization problems while minimizing communication rounds and ensuring adaptability and determinism.

Method: The methods—MT-GS and AMT-GS—utilize a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation paired with a multi-timescale sliding method that enables customizing update rates for different dual blocks.

Result: The MT-GS and AMT-GS methods achieve optimal complexities concerning $ε$ dependency in communication rounds and subgradient steps. AMT-GS additionally optimizes for $	ext{μ}$-strongly convex objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully reduce communication overhead and achieve optimal complexity in addressing distributed optimization problems, providing an answer to an open question on achievable linear dependency in communication rounds for non-smooth objectives.

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding (MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at potentially different rates.
  To find an $ε$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms achieve optimal dependency on $ε$: MT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/ε)$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/ε^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{εμ})$ communication rounds and $O(\overline{r}/(εμ))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also $μ$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

*Siwei Tu,Jingyi Xu,Weidong Yang,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces MODS, a novel model for downscaling meteorological data to high resolution (6.25 km) by leveraging multi-source satellite data and geospatial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current downscaling methods fail to capture comprehensive meteorological changes due to reliance on limited satellite data, leading to significant deviations in interpolated values from real-world conditions.

Method: The MODS model uses a conditional diffusion framework that incorporates diverse data sources (geostationary and polar-orbit satellites, topographic data) and employs multi-source cross-attention modules for feature fusion, pre-trained on ERA5 datasets.

Result: MODS achieves better accuracy and fidelity compared to existing methods when downscaling ERA5 meteorology maps at high resolution (6.25 km resolution).

Conclusion: Leveraging a broader range of satellite data and an advanced fusion mechanism, MODS successfully enhances the realism and consistency of high-resolution meteorological conditions.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

TL;DR: Social media groups play a key role in influencing user interests. This paper introduces CI4GI to improve group recommendations by better modeling the collaborative evolution of group- and item-level interests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify groups effectively to recommend to users by exploring collaborative influences between group-level and item-level user interests.

Method: A two-pronged approach: (1) Interest enhancement strategy to expand item-level interests based on group activities, and (2) Improved negative sampling by optimizing interest distribution distances.

Result: CI4GI significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models across three real-world datasets in Group Identification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CI4GI model improves group recommendations by addressing limitations in previous methods, offering a more holistic understanding of dual-level user interests.

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: The paper uses persistent homology to detect key shifts in public discourse following global events through the analysis of narrative structures in media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify structural changes in public discourse triggered by major global events, offering a real-time and unsupervised method for understanding how narratives evolve.

Method: The authors use co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases in daily news articles, apply Vietoris-Rips filtration to generate persistence diagrams, and compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to analyze shifts in narrative structures.

Result: The study finds that global events are often marked by spikes in H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating shifts in narrative coherence and structure. The temporal lag between changes in H0 and H1 highlights a bottom-up cascade of semantic change, with exceptions like the Russian invasion of Ukraine showing a top-down pattern of discourse framing.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that persistent homology provides an effective framework for detecting and analyzing shifts in narratives during major events, bringing new quantitative insights to computational social science.

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse? This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified, fair evaluation benchmark in protein foundation model research hinders progress in understanding models' generalizability and limitations.

Method: The authors developed PFMBench to benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models on 38 tasks from 8 areas of protein science, unveiling task correlations and performance insights.

Result: PFMBench identified inherent task correlations, pinpointed top-performing models, and provided a standardized evaluation protocol for future research.

Conclusion: The study bridges gaps in protein foundation model evaluation by offering a systematic benchmark, fostering improved understanding and development of models.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies. However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models, hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically, researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a streamlined evaluation protocol.

TL;DR: The study introduces a large language model (LLM) agent to automatically tune hyper-parameters for WS-PSO-CM algorithms in UAV communication, showing better outcomes than human heuristic or random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome low automation levels and subpar performance in heuristic-based hyper-parameter tuning for WS-PSO-CM algorithms used in UAV communication systems.

Method: An LLM agent is designed with an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP). The agent is guided by a predefined mission profile and employs WS-PSO-CM iteratively to explore and determine optimal hyper-parameters.

Result: The hyper-parameters derived using the LLM agent significantly improve the minimal sum-rate compared to those generated by human heuristics or random methods.

Conclusion: The LLM agent proves to be a practical and effective tool for automatically generating high-performance hyper-parameters for WS-PSO-CM in UAV communication systems.

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM) algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

TL;DR: This paper introduces gradient-free adaptation for wireless receivers using in-context learning (ICL) frameworks, showcasing their efficiency in real-time massive MIMO networks without online retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional model-based receivers struggle in challenging wireless environments, and current methods of adaptation for deep learning-based systems are either inflexible or require extensive optimization.

Method: The study proposes adaptation techniques grounded in in-context learning using Transformer models and structured state-space models, supported by theoretical and empirical analyses.

Result: ICL frameworks effectively enable real-time receiver adaptation in cell-free massive MIMO setups, leveraging pilot signals and contextual data without needing gradient descent or retraining.

Conclusion: In-context learning offers an efficient and dynamic adaptation strategy for wireless receivers, marking a significant improvement over existing strategies.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.

Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks surpass linear methods in modeling gradient distortions, enabling retrospective correction of errors.

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality. Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.

Results: The trained network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper assesses the utility of GPT-4o in extracting economic narratives from text corpora, comparing it to expert annotators and traditional pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing interest and challenges in extracting economic narratives from texts using advanced language models and NLP techniques.

Method: The authors use GPT-4o to extract economic narratives from inflation-related articles from major newspapers, and compare the outputs to expert-annotated narratives.

Result: GPT-4o can produce structured and valid economic narratives but doesn't yet match expert-level performance on complex documents.

Conclusion: While promising, GPT-4o's narrative extraction capability still has limitations, and the paper offers guidance for integrating LLMs in future economic and social sciences research.

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts. Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives.

TL;DR: The paper develops an OCR-based speech synthesis system using LabVIEW to help visually impaired individuals access books via sound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals have limited access to books due to reliance on Braille and audio recordings, creating the need for a better solution.

Method: The system employs OCR technology implemented through LabVIEW to convert text into speech.

Result: An accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly system that provides speech synthesis for visually impaired people has been developed.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers an improved method for visually impaired individuals to access written content using sound.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate, reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition (OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper proposes SonicVerse, a multi-task model that generates detailed music captions by combining language generation with music feature detection. Integrating low-level and high-level aspects enhances captions for short and long music pieces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enrich music databases and advance music AI by enabling detailed and accurate music captions, addressing gaps in the quality of music annotations.

Method: The method involves a projection-based architecture that processes audio to generate language tokens for captions while detecting music features through auxiliary heads. A modular extractor and an extended dataset are utilized for training.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that adding music features improves the detail and quality of the captions generated by SonicVerse.

Conclusion: SonicVerse successfully produces rich music captions and enables time-informed descriptions for longer pieces, showcasing the benefit of integrating feature-based emphasis in music captioning.

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper discusses a framework for automating the analysis of extensive audio datasets collected using passive acoustic monitoring for wildlife research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of efficiently processing large-scale audio datasets, which are impractical to analyze manually, by introducing a tool for automated detection of vocalizations and sounds.

Method: The authors present pycnet-audio, a processing workflow built around the PNW-Cnet model, which utilizes machine learning techniques for detecting sounds of 80 wildlife species and various anthropogenic/environmental noises in acoustic monitoring data.

Result: PNW-Cnet demonstrated an ability to broaden its detection capability from forest owls to a diverse range of forest wildlife species and noise categories, facilitating wildlife research and monitoring.

Conclusion: pycnet-audio provides an efficient solution to automate large-scale acoustic data processing, enhancing the ability to monitor wildlife populations and environmental sounds.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs). The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the research gap in balancing noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation for speech enhancement.

Method: Benchmarking three deep learning models (Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, U-Net) across diverse datasets and metrics such as SNR improvements, PESQ scores, and VeriSpeak performance.

Result: U-Net excels in noise suppression, CMGAN leads in perceptual quality, and Wave-U-Net balances attributes with improved speaker-specific feature retention.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs among advanced methods and suggests implications for applications in voice biometrics, forensic audio, telecommunication, and speaker verification.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A method to use existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing while preserving the audio's structure and content, without requiring additional model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-music generation models struggle with control during the generation process, creating challenges in producing specific desired audio outcomes.

Method: Leverages pretrained text-to-music diffusion models and selects optimal intermediate timesteps using an instrument classifier to preserve content while achieving desired timbre.

Result: The method effectively performs instrument editing without additional model training or sacrificing generation speed.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for controlled instrument editing in text-to-music generation models, improving usability without added complexity.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based deep learning model to forecast microearthquake evolution during fluid injection operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-time seismic-risk assessment and advance geo-engineering applications like enhanced geothermal systems and CO2 sequestration by accurately predicting the spatiotemporal evolution of MEQs.

Method: A transformer-based model forecasts cumulative MEQ count, seismic moment, and spatial extents using hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ data.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy ($R^2 >0.98$ for 1-second and $R^2 >0.88$ for 15-second horizons) on the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, along with providing uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: The deep learning approach presents strong potential for aiding real-time monitoring and risk mitigation in fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.
