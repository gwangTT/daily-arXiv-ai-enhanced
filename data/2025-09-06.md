### [1] [PG-Agent: An Agent Powered by Page Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03536)
*Weizhi Chen,Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Sheng Zhou,Xiaoxuan Tang,Jiajun Bu,Yong Li,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces PG-Agent, a GUI agent framework that leverages page graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to better understand GUI environments and generalize to new scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of existing GUI agents that rely on sequential episodes and struggle to deeply perceive GUI environments and generalize to new scenarios due to inadequate modeling of page transition relationships.

Method: The paper proposes transforming sequential episodes into page graphs to capture page relationships and utilizing RAG technology along with a multi-agent task decomposition framework (PG-Agent) to effectively retrieve perception guidelines and enable generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that PG-Agent effectively improves GUI environment perception and generalization capabilities, even with limited episodes available for constructing page graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed PG-Agent demonstrates high effectiveness in enhancing GUI agent performance, providing a promising approach for building adaptable and perceptive GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

### [2] [Multilinear and Linear Programs for Partially Identifiable Queries in Quasi-Markovian Structural Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03548)
*João P. Arroyo,João G. Rodrigues,Daniel Lawand,Denis D. Mauá,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Alex Gray,Eduardo R. Laurentino,Fabio G. Cozman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores bounds on probabilities in causal models where exogenous variable distributions are not fully determined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in calculating probabilities in partially specified acyclic causal models.

Method: A new algorithm exploiting probabilities of endogenous variables and using column generation with linear integer programs for efficient computation.

Result: The proposed approach using column generation outperforms existing methods in computing probability bounds.

Conclusion: The representation of exogenous variables can be simplified to polynomial cardinality, making tight probability bounds computation more feasible.

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [3] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diffusion-AC, a novel framework integrating diffusion probabilistic models for Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) in air traffic management. It overcomes limitations of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods by enabling multimodal decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in global air traffic necessitates robust and safe CD&R systems. Existing DRL approaches suffer from a 'unimodal bias,' leading to decision-making limitations and deadlocks in complex scenarios.

Method: The Diffusion-AC framework uses reverse denoising with a value function to create multimodal action distributions, ensuring flexibility. It also includes a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC) for stable learning from low- to high-density air traffic scenarios.

Result: Extensive simulations show that Diffusion-AC achieves a 94.1% success rate in high-density traffic and reduces Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) by 59% compared to the next-best method.

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC addresses critical limitations of prior DRL methods, offering significant safety improvements and decision-making adaptability for air traffic management.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

### [4] [Learning When to Plan: Efficiently Allocating Test-Time Compute for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03581)
*Davide Paglieri,Bartłomiej Cupiał,Jonathan Cook,Ulyana Piterbarg,Jens Tuyls,Edward Grefenstette,Jakob Nicolaus Foerster,Jack Parker-Holder,Tim Rocktäschel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for enabling large language model agents to dynamically decide when to allocate computational resources for planning, improving their efficiency and problem-solving in decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the limitations of existing methods like ReAct, which either always plan (computationally expensive and inefficient for long-horizon tasks) or never plan (restricting performance), the paper aims to create a more flexible and efficient approach to planning.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline is introduced: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime the model's dynamic planning ability, and (2) reinforcement learning to refine this capability in long-horizon environments.

Result: Dynamic planning agents trained using this method demonstrate better sample efficiency, accomplish more complex objectives, and can be steered by human-written plans, improving problem-solving beyond their independent capabilities.

Conclusion: The work pioneers the training of LLM agents for dynamic compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, leading to more adaptive, efficient, and controllable agentic systems.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

### [5] [Explainable Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) with KG-SMILE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03626)
*Zahra Zehtabi Sabeti Moghaddam,Zeinab Dehghani,Maneeha Rani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Rameez Raja Kureshi,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces KG-SMILE, a method-agnostic framework for enhancing transparency in Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through controlled perturbations and attribution metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many generative AI systems, like LLMs, suffer from hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting their reliability in sensitive domains such as healthcare. RAG helps address this by grounding outputs in external knowledge but lacks transparency and operates as a black box.

Method: The authors created KG-SMILE, a perturbation-based framework that applies controlled distortions, computes similarities, and trains weighted surrogate models to identify the most influential graph entities and relations in Graph RAG systems.

Result: The study demonstrates KG-SMILE's ability to produce stable, human-aligned explanations, validated through fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: KG-SMILE improves the interpretability of Graph-based RAG systems, enabling better transparency and fostering trust in machine learning technologies.

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

### [6] [CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636)
*Jacqueline Maasch,John Kalantari,Kia Khezeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalARC, a test environment for studying AI reasoning under low-data and distribution shift conditions, suitable for tasks like counterfactual reasoning and causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a testbed that facilitates the study of AI reasoning when faced with limited data and novel settings involving distribution shifts.

Method: CausalARC uses structural causal models and principled data augmentations to offer observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback for few-shot and in-context learning demonstrations.

Result: The authors showcase CausalARC's utility in four AI reasoning tasks: abstract reasoning, counterfactual reasoning, program synthesis, and causal discovery.

Conclusion: CausalARC provides a robust environment for studying and advancing AI's reasoning abilities in challenging scenarios by leveraging causal world models.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

### [7] [Towards a Neurosymbolic Reasoning System Grounded in Schematic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03644)
*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Embodied-LM, a neurosymbolic system using image schemas for spatial reasoning to enhance LLMs' logical reasoning and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with robust logical reasoning and human-like comprehension, motivating the need for systems grounded in human cognitive structures.

Method: Embodied-LM uses image schemas as schematic representations grounded in sensorimotor experience, operationalized through declarative spatial reasoning in Answer Set Programming.

Result: Evaluation on logical deduction problems shows that LLMs guided by embodied cognitive structures achieve better logical reasoning and interpretability.

Conclusion: By leveraging spatial primitives, the system lays a foundation for integrating more sophisticated cognitive structures into LLMs for improved logical reasoning.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

### [8] [Emergent Hierarchical Reasoning in LLMs through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03646)
*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reinforcement learning enhances reasoning abilities of large language models and introduces a more efficient algorithm, HICRA, which emphasizes high-level strategic planning over low-level procedural skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models is not well understood, and there is a need to uncover and address inefficiencies in current RL algorithms.

Method: The authors analyze the reasoning process in RL-trained LLMs, unveil a two-phase learning dynamic, and develop a novel algorithm called Hierarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA) that focuses optimization efforts on strategic planning tokens.

Result: HICRA outperforms strong RL baselines by concentrating on strategic bottlenecks rather than diluting learning signals across all tokens.

Conclusion: Focusing optimization efforts on high-level strategic planning tokens significantly improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models in RL, addressing inefficiencies in common algorithms like GRPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

### [9] [The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730)
*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring how these traits evolve during training, predict behavior, and are affected by interventions like persona injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether advanced LLMs exhibit personality-like traits and behaviors similar to humans, and to understand how these traits emerge, evolve, and interact with external interventions.

Method: Systematically characterized LLM personality using dynamic trait profiling, behavioral validation studies, and evaluating interventions such as persona injection to assess their impact on self-reports and behavior.

Result: Instruction alignment like RLHF and instruction tuning stabilizes traits and enhances correlations resembling human data, but self-reported traits poorly predict behavior, and persona injection—while altering self-reports—has limited or inconsistent behavioral impact.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit surface-level personality-like traits, but these do not reliably translate to consistent behaviors. This challenges assumptions about LLM personality and highlights the need for more profound evaluation in alignment and interpretability domains.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

### [10] [An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649)
*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of time series segmentation on SHAP explanation quality, finding equal-length segmentation generally superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the computational efficiency and explanation quality of SHAP for Time Series Classification models.

Method: Eight time series segmentation algorithms were compared, incorporating a new attribution normalization technique.

Result: Equal-length segmentation consistently outperformed custom algorithms, and normalization improved attribution quality.

Conclusion: Segment count matters more than segmentation method, and attribution normalization enhances explanation reliability.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

### [11] [PersonaTeaming: Exploring How Introducing Personas Can Improve Automated AI Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03728)
*Wesley Hanwen Deng,Sunnie S. Y. Kim,Akshita Jha,Ken Holstein,Motahhare Eslami,Lauren Wilcox,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PersonaTeaming, a novel automated red-teaming approach that leverages personas for enhanced adversarial prompt generation in AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the role of diverse identities and backgrounds in red-teaming, which traditional automated methods fail to incorporate, to surface potential risks in AI systems more effectively.

Method: The authors develop a methodology introducing personas into adversarial prompt generation, including 'red-teaming expert' and 'regular AI user' personas. They also create a dynamic algorithm for generating adaptive personas and introduce new metrics called 'mutation distance' to measure adversarial prompt variations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate up to a 144.1% improvement in attack success rates using persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity compared to an existing method called RainbowPlus.

Conclusion: The PersonaTeaming method shows promise in enhancing automated red-teaming and highlights the need for further exploration between human and automated approaches to improve AI governance and safety.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

*Connor Walker,Koorosh Aslansefat,Mohammad Naveed Akram,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGuard, a specialized framework enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for offshore wind maintenance by ensuring both technical depth and safety assurance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with specialized or safety-critical scenarios in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, motivating the need for a framework that prioritizes both technical accuracy and safety.

Method: RAGuard explicitly incorporates safety-critical documents and technical manuals into its retrieval system, using dual indices, separate retrieval budgets, and a SafetyClamp extension for enhanced safety integration.

Result: RAGuard achieves over 50% Safety Recall@K and maintains Technical Recall above 60%, outperforming standard RAG frameworks in balancing technical accuracy and safety guarantees.

Conclusion: RAGuard and SafetyClamp set a new benchmark for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support systems for critical OSW maintenance scenarios.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

### [13] [Are LLM Agents Behaviorally Coherent? Latent Profiles for Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736)
*James Mooney,Josef Woldense,Zheng Robert Jia,Shirley Anugrah Hayati,My Ha Nguyen,Vipul Raheja,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) are internally consistent in their behavior across different experimental settings, finding significant inconsistencies despite their ability to mimic human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess whether synthetic agents, powered by LLMs, can effectively substitute for human participants in social science research by examining their internal consistency across different scenarios.

Method: The study involves designing experiments to reveal the agent's internal state and examine its conversational behavior to evaluate consistency with behavioral hypotheses.

Result: The findings indicate significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across different model types and sizes, even when their answers match those of human counterparts.

Conclusion: Large language models are currently flawed in their ability to serve as substitutes for human participants in research due to their lack of internal consistency.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF) designed for adaptive reasoning among multi-agent systems using large language models, paired with a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, SoftRankPO. It achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed collaboration protocols in multi-agent systems with LLMs limit their effectiveness, as agents lack adaptability based on cognitive states like uncertainty or confidence.

Method: The Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF) is introduced, utilizing decentralized policies over meta-cognitive actions (Persist, Refine, Concede) and SoftRankPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that stabilizes training by reshaping rewards based on ranked advantages.

Result: MPDF with SoftRankPO yields a 4-5% improvement in average accuracy across five reasoning benchmarks, outperforming six state-of-the-art multi-agent reasoning algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that adaptive meta-cognitive policies, rather than static collaboration protocols, significantly enhance the performance of multi-agent LLM systems in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with domain experts and their potential to inform social policymaking, specifically regarding homelessness alleviation, using a novel benchmark and automated pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore if LLMs can provide valuable insights for social policymaking in complex domains, focusing on homelessness alleviation, a global issue affecting over 150 million people.

Method: The authors developed a novel benchmark using decision scenarios across four geographies and linked policy choices to an agent-based model to simulate their social impacts. The conceptual framework of the Capability Approach was used.

Result: LLMs showed promising potential in informing social policymaking by suggesting alternative policies at scale when combined with responsible guardrails and expert collaboration.

Conclusion: LLMs can be valuable tools for social policymaking, especially when aligned with domain experts and contextualized frameworks to ensure responsible and impactful outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OMOP CDM standardizes health data for research, but mapping medical terms is resource-intensive. A new system uses the Model Context Protocol to securely leverage LLMs for accurate and efficient mapping while preventing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardizing heterogeneous health data in OMOP CDM demands accurate mapping of medical terms, a process that is both challenging and prone to errors.

Method: The authors developed a zero-training mapping system using the Model Context Protocol, allowing LLMs to interact with external tools securely while preventing hallucinations. The system emphasizes explainability and real-time capabilities.

Result: This new mapping system significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of linking medical terms to OMOP standard concepts with minimal effort required.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances data standardization workflows by providing reliable, secure, and efficient term mapping, making it viable for both research and production applications.

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

*Kaizhen Tan,Yufan Wu,Yuxuan Liu,Haoran Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered framework to analyze tourist perceptions in historic urban quarters using multimodal data from social media, focusing on visual and emotional responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve how tourists perceive historic urban quarters for sustainable, human-centered urban planning.

Method: The paper employs a multidimensional framework combining semantic segmentation for focal points, clustering methods for color analysis, and a hybrid sentiment analysis with BERT to study tourist-shared photos and reviews.

Result: Findings highlight spatial variations in aesthetic appeal, mismatches between expected and actual visuals, and satisfaction differences across tourist activities, the built environment, and other dimensions.

Conclusion: The integrated framework supports informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and urban design, fostering better planning and public engagement.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for evaluating the reliability of Generative AI (GEN AI) using deterministic and large language model (LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and various quantitative metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI models face challenges such as hallucinations, biases, and lack of transparency in evaluation, and existing methods relying on subjective human judgment are insufficient.

Method: The authors propose creating two Knowledge Graphs (one deterministic and one LLM-generated) from real-time data like news articles and analyzing these with metrics like ICR, IPR, and CI to detect deviations and anomalies dynamically.

Result: An automated framework identifies significant discrepancies between deterministic and LLM-generated KGs, using historical trends to flag semantic anomalies or issues like hallucinations in real time.

Conclusion: The study offers a scalable, transparent system for monitoring and improving the reliability of Generative AI through structured and metric-driven evaluation.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

*Sina Khajehabdollahi,Gautier Hamon,Marko Cvjetko,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Clément Moulin-Frier,Cédric Colas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Expedition & Expansion (E&E) strategy to explore diverse patterns in continuous cellular automata by combining local novelty-driven searches with goal-directed expeditions leveraging Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exploration techniques like Novelty Search plateau when local novelty is exhausted, making it difficult to discover diverse patterns in high-dimensional spaces such as continuous cellular automata.

Method: The E&E method involves alternating between local novelty expansions and goal-directed expeditions. Expeditions use Vision-Language Models to generate linguistic goals, enabling exploration of uncharted regions while aligning with human perception.

Result: E&E uncovers more diverse solutions than existing methods when tested on Flow Lenia. Genealogical analysis shows that expedition-originated solutions significantly influence long-term exploration, opening new behavioral niches.

Conclusion: E&E effectively transcends local novelty limitations, explores behavioral spaces in human-aligned ways, and presents a valuable framework for open-ended exploration in artificial life and related fields.

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), an AI agent powered by Large Language Models, designed to simplify interactions on C2C e-commerce platforms by transitioning from GUI-based workflows to conversational text commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitally navigating complex GUI interfaces on e-commerce platforms is time-consuming and inefficient for users.

Method: FaMA uses Large Language Models to function as a conversational assistant that interprets natural language commands, automating tasks for buyers and sellers.

Result: FaMA achieved a 98% task success rate and doubled interaction speed by facilitating efficient task execution through conversational AI.

Conclusion: Agentic AI like FaMA can streamline e-commerce activities, offering users a more accessible, intuitive, and efficient interface compared to traditional GUI approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1 is a medical foundation model designed for chest X-ray interpretation, emphasizing transparent reasoning and interpretability, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models lack transparent reasoning, which limits their clinical applicability, especially in tasks like chest X-ray interpretation.

Method: DeepMedix-R1 employs a three-stage training pipeline: fine-tuning on instruction data, synthetic reasoning samples, and reinforcement learning to improve reasoning and answer quality.

Result: DeepMedix-R1 demonstrates significant improvements in report generation and visual question answering tasks compared to other models. Expert reviews show superior interpretability and clinical plausibility.

Conclusion: DeepMedix-R1 represents an advancement in medical foundation models by producing transparent, clinically relevant answers, making it suitable for practical applications in chest X-ray interpretation.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel heuristic search algorithm for efficiently handling continuous numeric decision variables in automated planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches treat control parameters as constraints rather than decision points, limiting their effectiveness in planning problems.

Method: A best-first heuristic search algorithm is developed, leveraging delayed partial expansion to efficiently explore infinite decision spaces.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing methods for planning with control parameters.

Conclusion: Explicitly addressing control parameters as decision points enhances the planning process, providing a viable and efficient alternative to constraint-based approaches.

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

TL;DR: The WorMI framework enhances embodied AI agents' adaptability across domains without extensive retraining by leveraging large language models and domain-specific world models through test-time composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of enabling embodied AI agents to adapt to new domains efficiently, with minimal data collection and retraining steps.

Method: WorMI combines the reasoning abilities of large language models with domain-specific, independently learned world models through test-time composition. It uses prototype-based world model retrieval and a world-wise compound attention method for integration.

Result: The framework outperformed multiple LLM-based approaches, achieving superior zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen domains in VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks.

Conclusion: WorMI successfully demonstrates robust adaptability and scalability for embodied agents across domains, making it viable for real-world deployment scenarios where data efficiency is crucial.

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR), a framework that enhances task adaptability and performance for large language model agents by leveraging structured memory and rule-based mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language model agents often face challenges such as repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and difficulty adapting across tasks. Existing solutions either create task-specific knowledge that isn't reusable or require computationally expensive updates.

Method: MPR consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a structured Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies it through soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks, avoiding the need for model parameter updates.

Result: Empirical results in text-based environments show consistent improvements in execution accuracy, robustness, and stability when MPR is applied compared to Reflexion baselines.

Conclusion: MPR demonstrates how externalizing and reusing corrective knowledge can improve adaptability and performance for LLM agents, while maintaining scalability and identifying areas for future exploration.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPBO, an LLM-powered framework that enhances local search solvers for pseudo-Boolean optimization, showing significant performance improvements compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current design of local search solvers for pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) requires considerable expert effort and manual tuning. Hence, automating and optimizing these solvers is desirable to improve their efficiency.

Method: The authors developed AutoPBO, a framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically enhance the design of PBO local search solvers. They tested it on four diverse benchmarks against six state-of-the-art solvers.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated that AutoPBO significantly improved local search solver performance and showed competitive results compared to state-of-the-art solvers.

Conclusion: AutoPBO presents a promising advancement in the automation of local search solver design for PBO, reducing reliance on human expertise and manual tuning while achieving high performance.

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Space, a novel framework for reasoning-level optimization in large language models, addressing gaps in traditional token-level reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between token-level RL frameworks and the reasoning-level nature of complex multi-step processes in LLMs like Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Method: They propose recasting reasoning in LLMs as an optimization problem within a continuous semantic space, analyzing the trade-offs of underfitting and overfitting and conducting extensive experiments.

Result: The proposed CoT-Space framework explains phenomena like overthinking, converges towards an optimal Chain-of-Thought length, and achieves strong empirical validation.

Conclusion: CoT-Space establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding reasoning in LLMs and can guide the development of more effective reasoning agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oruga, a system based on Representational Systems Theory (RST) aimed at modeling flexible and transformable representations, inspired by human cognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to replicate human-like flexibility in representations, such as diagram creation, analogical reasoning, and cross-domain application, to enhance machine compatibility with human use.

Method: The authors implement RST into a system called Oruga, which includes a core of data structures, a communication language, and an engine for transformation based on a method called structure transfer.

Result: Oruga's core, language, and transformation capabilities are presented, alongside an example of how the structure transfer method performs transformations.

Conclusion: Oruga demonstrates the potential to capture essential aspects of RST, paving the way for machines to adopt human-like flexibility in representation and reasoning.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

*Alexander Beiser,David Penz,Nysret Musliu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how the choice of formal language impacts the performance of Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning, which combines LLMs and symbolic solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models excel in many tasks, their reasoning ability in formal scenarios remains inadequate. Understanding the factors influencing Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning success is crucial.

Method: The authors compare four formal languages across three datasets and seven large language models, analyzing their impact on reasoning capabilities.

Result: The choice of formal language significantly influences syntactic and semantic reasoning performance, with variable effects across different LLMs.

Conclusion: Selecting an appropriate formal language is essential for improving Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning, demonstrating its importance beyond previous considerations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

### [30] [Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100)
*Alberto Luise,Michele Lombardi,Florent Teichteil Koenigsbuch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and traditional solvers for emergency flight path optimization, achieving near-optimal solutions faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergencies require rapid flight path recalculations, but conventional solvers alone are computationally intensive.

Method: An RL agent pre-computes constrained near-optimal paths using location and atmospheric data to reduce the size of solver search spaces, enhancing computation speed.

Result: Empirical results show fuel consumption remains nearly identical to unconstrained methods, with deviations ~1%, and computation time reduced by up to 50%.

Conclusion: The RL-based strategy successfully accelerates route optimization while maintaining near-optimal fuel consumption, albeit without guaranteeing global optimality.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

### [31] [Analysis of Bluffing by DQN and CFR in Leduc Hold'em Poker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04125)
*Tarik Zaciragic,Aske Plaat,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores bluffing behavior in poker using two algorithms, DQN and CFR, in a simplified poker game called Leduc Hold'em. Both algorithms exhibit bluffing, but in distinct styles, suggesting bluffing as a universal game aspect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the overlooked aspect of bluffing behavior in poker algorithms, as most studies prioritize win rates and algorithmic efficiency.

Method: Designing an experiment where DQN and CFR play against each other in Leduc Hold'em, observing and analyzing logged actions to determine bluffing behavior.

Result: Both DQN and CFR demonstrate bluffing, but in varying styles. Success rates of bluffs are comparable, irrespective of the algorithm.

Conclusion: The study highlights bluffing as a critical feature in poker gameplay, irrespective of the algorithm, and encourages exploration of diverse bluffing strategies and the full poker game in future research.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

### [32] [The human biological advantage over AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04130)
*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses whether AI could surpass humans as universal leaders, emphasizing the central nervous system (CNS) as a distinctive human trait vital for emotional and ethical leadership.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about AI potentially becoming superior to humans and claiming leadership over the universe.

Method: A conceptual analysis contrasting AI capabilities with the human CNS, arguing that AI lacks the emotional and ethical capacities tied to human biology.

Result: It argues that while AI may outperform humans in various domains, it cannot replicate the CNS's emotional and ethical functions necessary for leadership.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that human DNA, with its biological CNS, lays a stronger foundation for universal leadership than AI's silicon-based framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

### [34] [Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192)
*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the behavior of probability distributions defined by Markov logic networks (MLNs) as domain size grows infinitely, focusing on quantifier-free MLNs, triangle-sensitive graphs, and degree-sensitive graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand how MLNs perform probabilistic reasoning over infinite domain sizes and explore the conditions where MLNs differ significantly from other frameworks like Bayesian networks or uniform distributions.

Method: Three types of MLNs are analyzed: quantifier-free ones with a single unary relation, MLNs sensitive to graph triangles or k-cliques, and MLNs that penalize high-degree vertices. Analyses also include a comparison between MLNs and Bayesian networks.

Result: Different soft constraints lead to varying limit behaviors in random structures, and the influence of weights varies. MLNs exhibit distinct probability concentration properties compared to uniform distributions, showing asymptotic incomparability with certain Bayesian networks.

Conclusion: As domain size grows, MLNs show diverse probabilistic behaviors that depend on their constraints. MLNs define distributions that may differ fundamentally from other frameworks in large domains, offering insights into their probabilistic characteristics.

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

*Yunbo Long,Liming Xu,Lukas Beckenbauer,Yuhan Liu,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo introduces an emotion-aware reinforcement learning framework that enhances the effectiveness of large language models in negotiations by optimizing dynamic emotional expressions, outperforming traditional strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the shortcomings of existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents in negotiations, which generate passive and easily exploitable emotional responses, lacking adaptive emotional engagement.

Method: The authors propose EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that uses Markov Decision Processes and genetic optimization to develop dynamic emotional expressions for negotiation scenarios.

Result: EvoEmo demonstrates superior performance in negotiation tasks compared to vanilla or fixed-emotion strategies, achieving higher success rates, efficiency, and buyer savings.

Conclusion: The study underscores the value of adaptive emotional expression in making LLM agents more effective in complex negotiation environments.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

*Isidoro Tamassia,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper modifies the AlphaZero framework to improve its performance in test environments that may differ from the training environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero assumes the test environment remains the same as the training environment, limiting its flexibility.

Method: The researchers introduced simple adjustments to AlphaZero's standard framework to handle changes in the test environment.

Result: The modifications significantly improved AlphaZero's performance, even in conditions with limited planning resources.

Conclusion: Adapting AlphaZero with these modifications makes it more versatile for use in dynamic environments and the code implementation is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MBTI-in-Thoughts conditions LLM behavior with psychological personality archetypes using MBTI, enabling tailored responses and improved performance in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance control over LLM agent behaviors through psychological personality conditioning, based on human psychological theories like MBTI.

Method: The framework utilizes MBTI personality archetypes via prompt engineering to prime agents, ensuring stable and interpretable behavioral biases. Automated personality verification is done using the 16Personalities test.

Result: Priming LLM agents with MBTI archetypes yields task-specific improvements: expressive agents excel in narratives, analytical agents in game strategies, and self-reflection boosts cooperation and reasoning.

Conclusion: MBTI-in-Thoughts seamlessly integrates psychological theories into LLM design, promoting individualized AI agent behavior and performance without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

*Matthew Ho,Chen Si,Zhaoxiang Feng,Fangxu Yu,Zhijian Liu,Zhiting Hu,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for large language models (LLMs) to use persistent, concept-level external memory for reasoning tasks, leading to improved performance and self-improvement capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research seeks to address the limitations of LLMs discarding useful insights after a reasoning trace by proposing reusable, concept-level external memory to enhance reasoning for complex tasks.

Method: The method involves abstracting modular concepts from solution traces and storing them in natural language. These abstracted concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into prompts for test-time continual learning, without the need for weight updates.

Result: On the ARC-AGI benchmark, the proposed memory method achieves a 7.5% relative gain over baseline models. Performance improves further with increased inference compute, and dynamic memory updating during test-time outperforms fixed memory settings.

Conclusion: The introduction of reusable, abstract concept-level memory boosts reasoning performance and enables self-improvement of LLMs over time through dynamic memory updates.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper presents a mapping framework for neural network inference that streamlines computation and communication to maximize on-chip efficiency and minimize reliance on external components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in deep learning inference, particularly in terms of over-reliance on I/O, off-chip memory, and host control.

Method: The framework uses predictable neural network behavior to pre-plan operations, leveraging in-array techniques like stationary-weight reuse, multicasting, and staged reductions within a message-based compute architecture.

Result: The approach achieves high resource utilization (88-92%), scales computation throughput beyond 1 TFLOP/s, limits off-chip memory traffic, and drastically reduces communication overhead per layer.

Conclusion: The proposed streaming-based computation model effectively enhances data flow and coordination, demonstrating substantial scalability and efficiency in deep learning inference.

Abstract: We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.

Motivation: Transformers and VLMs face deployment challenges in constrained environments due to their computational complexity, memory demands, and irregular data patterns.

Method: The authors analyze design trade-offs, optimization strategies, and hardware-algorithm co-design innovations for FPGA-based inference, including aspects like quantization, sparsity, and cross-attention memory management.

Result: They provide insights into balancing heterogeneous compute, improving efficiency, and addressing practical implementation issues like verification and runtime flexibility.

Conclusion: The paper outlines future directions for scalable FPGA solutions adaptable to evolving AI models, bridging advanced multimodal AI with hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Transformers and vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as dominant
architectures in computer vision and multimodal AI, offering state-of-the-art
performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, visual
question answering, and caption generation. However, their high computational
complexity, large memory footprints, and irregular data access patterns present
significant challenges for deployment in latency- and power-constrained

hardware platform for such workloads due to their reconfigurability,
fine-grained parallelism, and potential for energy-efficient acceleration. This
paper presents a comprehensive review of design trade-offs, optimization
strategies, and implementation challenges for FPGA-based inference of
transformers and VLMs. We examine critical factors such as device-class
selection, memory subsystem constraints, dataflow orchestration, quantization
strategies, sparsity exploitation, and toolchain choices, alongside
modality-specific issues unique to VLMs, including heterogeneous compute
balancing and cross-attention memory management. Additionally, we discuss
emerging trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, highlighting innovations in
attention mechanisms, compression, and modular overlays to improve efficiency
and adaptability. Practical issues such as runtime flexibility, verification
overhead, and the absence of standardized FPGA multimodal benchmarks are also
considered. Finally, we outline future directions toward scalable, portable,

while sustaining high utilization and predictable performance. This synthesis
offers both a technical foundation and a forward-looking perspective to help

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper reviews real-time object detection (OD) algorithms and their hardware accelerators for autonomous vehicles, focusing on the current state and potential future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient, real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles that ensures safety and performance, given the limitations in algorithm and hardware disclosures from commercial providers.

Method: The authors survey existing object detection algorithms, particularly focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their deployment on hardware accelerators like GPUs and ASICs.

Result: While current OD algorithms achieve hundreds of frames per second, limitations in handling multiple camera feeds and non-disclosure of specifics by AV companies remain significant problems.

Conclusion: The paper aims to bridge academic research with commercial autonomous vehicle technologies, offering insights for the next generation of fully autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: The efficiency of object detectors depends on factors like detection
accuracy, processing time, and computational resources. Processing time is
crucial for real-time applications, particularly for autonomous vehicles (AVs),
where instantaneous responses are vital for safety. This review paper provides
a concise yet comprehensive survey of real-time object detection (OD)
algorithms for autonomous cars delving into their hardware accelerators (HAs).
Non-neural network-based algorithms, which use statistical image processing,
have been entirely substituted by AI algorithms, such as different models of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their intrinsically parallel features led
them to be deployable into edge-based HAs of various types, where GPUs and, to
a lesser extent, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) remain the most
widely used. Throughputs of hundreds of frames/s (fps) could be reached;
however, handling object detection for all the cameras available in a typical
AV requires further hardware and algorithmic improvements. The intensive
competition between AV providers has limited the disclosure of algorithms,
firmware, and even hardware platform details. This remains a hurdle for
researchers, as commercial systems provide valuable insights while academics
undergo lengthy training and testing on restricted datasets and road scenarios.
Consequently, many AV research papers may not be reflected in end products,
being developed under limited conditions. This paper surveys state-of-the-art
OD algorithms and aims to bridge the gap with technologies in commercial AVs.
To our knowledge, this aspect has not been addressed in earlier surveys. Hence,
the paper serves as a tangible reference for researchers designing future
generations of vehicles, expected to be fully autonomous for comfort and
safety.

TL;DR: This study evaluates large language model strategies for identifying dementia from speech, using the DementiaBank corpus. Token-level fine-tuning and optimal adaptation strategies improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, over half of US adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias remain undiagnosed. The study aims to explore scalable speech-based detection using AI models.

Method: The study tested nine text-only and three multimodal (audio-text) models with varied adaptation strategies, including in-context learning, reasoning-augmented prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Class-centroid demonstrations achieved the best in-context learning; fine-tuning produced superior results compared to baseline models. Multimodal models performed well but were outperformed by top text-only adaptations.

Conclusion: Model selection and adaptation strategy are critical for dementia detection via speech. Properly adapted open-weight models can rival or even outperform commercial systems.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [45] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a "Reinforced Behavior Alignment" (RBA) framework to enhance the ability of speech-based LLMs to follow instructions, overcoming their limitations compared to text-based LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance gap in instruction-following capabilities between speech-based Large Language Models (SpeechLMs) and text-based counterparts due to inter-modal discrepancies.

Method: The method involves using self-generated alignment data created by a powerful teacher LLM and employing reinforcement learning to align the behavior of SpeechLMs with that of the teacher, without relying on human annotations.

Result: Experimental results show improved instruction-following capabilities for SpeechLMs, outperforming traditional distillation methods. Additionally, RBA achieves state-of-the-art performances in tasks like spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation using only self-generated data.

Conclusion: RBA provides a scalable and effective approach for enhancing SpeechLM performance in linguistic instruction-following and task-specific benchmarks, demonstrating its potential without human-annotated data.

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency news analytics requires accurate qualitative and quantitative insights, eliminating hallucinations in large language models and providing structured data analysis.

Method: The study employs a Mistral 7B language model fine-tuned with PEFT/LoRA and 4-bit quantization to generate text and graph summaries, stacking them hierarchically for comprehensive reports.

Result: The approach demonstrated informative and effective analytics of cryptocurrency news, producing sentiment scores, JSON summaries, and insights through knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: Using fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM models, cryptocurrency news can be effectively translated into comprehensive, multi-perspective analyses, mitigating errors and enriching understanding.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ProLiFIC, a detailed event log documenting the Italian lawmaking process from 1987 to 2022, constructed using unstructured data and large language models (LLMs) to advance process mining (PM) in legal domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the application of process mining (PM) in legal contexts by addressing challenges associated with data quality and accessibility.

Method: ProLiFIC was created using unstructured legal data from Normattiva, processed and structured using large language models (LLMs).

Result: ProLiFIC serves as a detailed dataset that allows for analyses and acts as a benchmark for process mining in legal domains.

Conclusion: ProLiFIC bridges gaps in legal process mining, providing a valuable resource that integrates PM techniques with LLMs and sets foundations for future advancements.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal framework for analyzing earnings calls, utilizing hierarchical embeddings derived from text, audio, and video for improved semantic and structural understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current financial sentiment analysis models that fail to capture the layered discourse structure of earnings call interactions.

Method: Using a two-stage transformer architecture, this framework encodes multi-modal content and metadata into hierarchical discourse trees, enriching nodes with emotional signals and structured metadata.

Result: The embeddings generated exhibit semantic richness, structural awareness, and enhanced representations of affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical applications for tasks like financial forecasting and generalizes across other high-stakes communicative domains, offering robustness and explainability.

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel transformer-based method for predicting suicidal ideation and behavior in adolescents from forum posts prior to explicit self-disclosure, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to predict suicide risk in adolescents since many do not engage with mental health services. Social media presents a real-time opportunity to detect signs by analyzing online behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes user posts and interactions on a forum to predict if they will exhibit suicidal ideation or behavior in the future.

Result: The Early-SIB model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting suicidal ideation from forum posts on a Dutch youth platform.

Conclusion: Social media-based tools like Early-SIB can enhance existing approaches to suicide prevention by identifying risks earlier without relying solely on explicit self-disclosures.

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable, real-time method for identifying hallucinated tokens in language model outputs, focusing on entity-level hallucinations and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucinations in large language models, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical or legal use where fabricated information can cause harm. Existing methods are either limited or costly.

Method: Developed an annotation framework using web search for grounded labels on fabricated tokens. Trained hallucination classifiers with efficient approaches like linear probes, emphasizing entity-level detection for adaptability and streaming.

Result: Classifiers outperform existing methods, including those that are more expensive, across multiple settings such as long-form and short-form QA. They also generalize effectively to other models and tasks, like mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a practical and effective method for hallucination detection in language models, validating its scalability, transferability across models, and ability to generalize beyond entity-level hallucinations.

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

### [51] [Topic Identification in LLM Input-Output Pairs through the Lens of Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03533)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations in Large Language Models by proposing a novel clustering method, UDIB, to improve the quality of semantic divergence metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue of hallucinations in LLM responses, where the generated content deviates from given prompts, needs better frameworks for detecting such failures. Existing topic-identification methods lack focus on information-theoretic alignment.

Method: The paper introduces UDIB, a clustering method derived from the Deterministic Information Bottleneck approach, which regularizes entropy and utilizes an efficient KL-divergence upper bound for high-dimensional data.

Result: UDIB successfully identifies informative topic clusters, creating a joint topic representation for LLM prompts and responses. This representation improves the sensitivity of Semantic Divergence Metrics in detecting confabulations.

Conclusion: UDIB enhances the robustness of geometric clustering and information alignment in detecting LLM hallucinations, providing a more reliable tool for understanding semantic consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational
resources, but the lack of practice materials tailored to these resources
presents a significant challenge. This project addresses that gap by developing
a multi-modal question generation system that can automatically generate
diverse question types from various content formats. The system features four
major components: multi-modal input handling, question generation,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and an end-to-end
interactive interface. This project lays the foundation for automated,
scalable, and intelligent question generation, carefully balancing resource
efficiency, robust functionality and a smooth user experience.

*Cheng-Kai Yeh,Hsing-Wang Lee,Chung-Hung Kuo,Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces AR$^2$, a framework that boosts the abstraction capabilities of coding-oriented large language models using adversarial reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in training LLMs for abstraction, a critical skill for solving complex programming tasks effectively.

Method: AR$^2$ involves a teacher model transforming simple problems into complex narrative descriptions, while the student model learns to distill and solve these problems.

Result: The framework significantly enhances the student model's accuracy in solving unseen, challenging programming tasks.

Conclusion: Training for abstraction within LLMs improves their generalization, highlighting its importance in advancing code generation capabilities.

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

### [54] [Improving Factuality in LLMs via Inference-Time Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03540)
*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to enhance the factual accuracy of Large Language Models by dynamically constructing and refining knowledge graphs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often produce factually inconsistent answers due to limitations in their memory and inability to reason with compositional knowledge, even when augmented with external retrieval methods.

Method: The proposed framework dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs during inference. It starts by creating a seed graph from the question, then iteratively expands it using the LLM's internal knowledge and refines it by retrieving accurate external information.

Result: The approach showed consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability on three factual question-answering benchmarks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic knowledge graph construction at inference time is a viable method to enhance the factual accuracy of LLM responses while ensuring the process remains interpretable and scalable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Motivation: Understanding the evolution of scientific ideas requires structured reasoning across thematically related research beyond individual papers.

Method: The authors developed ResearchPulse, an agent-based system with three coordinated agents (Plan Agent, Mmap-Agent, and Lchart-Agent) to reconstruct research development chains and introduced a citation-aware benchmark dataset called ResearchPulse-Bench.

Result: ResearchPulse consistently outperformed strong baselines like GPT-4o in tasks like semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual representation.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse presents a pioneering approach to multi-document scientific inference, effectively addressing challenges in aligning and visualizing structured research data.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR is a resource-efficient OCR system optimized for deployment in constrained environments. A benchmark comparison shows it outperforms state-of-the-art LVLMs and traditional OCR systems in cost, speed, and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient OCR systems capable of handling multilingual, noisy real-world images in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Comparative evaluation of five LVLMs and two traditional OCR systems using a multilingual, doubly annotated dataset. Metrics include accuracy, efficiency, and deployment cost.

Result: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR achieved the highest F1 score, cost-effectiveness, and processing speed, outperforming LVLMs in edge deployments.

Conclusion: Traditional OCR systems like Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, despite advancements in LVLMs, remain more optimal for edge deployment due to their computational efficiency and affordability.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

*Dani Roytburg,Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Jou Barzdukas,Simon Fu,Narmeen Oozeer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the mitigation of 'self-preference bias' in large language models (LLMs) using steering vectors, significantly reducing unjustified bias but revealing limitations for legitimate preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the self-preference bias problem in LLMs, which compromises the fairness and reliability of evaluation systems, particularly for critical tasks like model routing and preference tuning.

Method: Researchers used a curated dataset to distinguish self-preference bias cases as justified or unjustified and applied two techniques—Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and an optimization-based approach—to generate steering vectors that can reduce bias during inference time.

Result: Steering vectors reduced unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97%, outperforming other methods like prompting and preference optimization. However, they showed instability in handling legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement.

Conclusion: While steering vectors show significant promise as a tool for mitigating unjustified bias in LLMs, their instability on legitimate preferences highlights the need for enhanced solutions to make evaluation pipelines robust and fair.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

### [59] [Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03662)
*Ali Noori,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses MIMIC-IV data to analyze the relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrences and semantic similarity, revealing complementary insights for improving clinical documentation and applications like decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in analyzing unstructured clinical notes and understand the relationship between concept co-occurrence and semantic similarity using SNOMED CT.

Method: The authors utilized MIMIC-IV database with Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT) to study relationships between frequently co-occurring SNOMED CT concepts and embedding-based semantic similarity.

Result: The study found weak correlation between co-occurrence and semantic similarity but showed that embeddings captured meaningful clinical associations. Embedding-based suggestions matched future documentations, coherent concept clusters were identified, and co-occurrence patterns were linked to outcomes like mortality and readmission.

Conclusion: Co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings can complement each other in improving clinical documentation, uncovering hidden clinical relationships, and supporting decision-making and patient phenotyping.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

*Parush Gera,Tempestt Neal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLSD, a stance detection method that uses metric learning and triplet loss for cross-domain and cross-target scenarios, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of stance detection in cross-domain and cross-target scenarios by leveraging metric learning.

Method: The MLSD method implements metric learning with triplet loss to build a discriminative embedding space that enhances semantic understanding and domain adaptation.

Result: MLSD improves stance detection performance significantly across six models and multiple datasets, as validated through experiments.

Conclusion: MLSD effectively enhances cross-target and cross-domain stance detection using metric learning, demonstrating its utility for adapting to new target domains.

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

### [61] [SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SiLVERScore, an advanced metric for evaluating sign language generation that addresses limitations of traditional back-translation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing sign language generation rely on back-translation, which fails to account for the multimodal richness of sign language and introduces ambiguity in pinpointing errors.

Method: SiLVERScore evaluates sign language generation in a semantically-aware joint embedding space, ensuring robustness to variations and addressing generalization challenges across datasets.

Result: SiLVERScore exhibits superior performance, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.99 with minimal overlap on PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, outstripping traditional metrics.

Conclusion: SiLVERScore is proven to be an effective and robust tool for semantically-aware evaluation of sign language generation, addressing both semantic and prosodic variations while overcoming limitations of traditional metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [62] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large vision language models (VLMs) on interactive reasoning and introduces new metrics to assess grounding performance, finding disparities between models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation frameworks for VLMs in interactive grounding, as current benchmarks focus on single-turn/question answering settings.

Method: They designed a four-metric suite and conducted 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games to measure VLMs' grounding performance against humans.

Result: The study revealed that existing VLMs underperform humans on interactive grounding metrics, with GPT4o-mini being the closest in patterns. Additionally, task success and alignment scores were shown insufficient for grounding analysis.

Conclusion: The introduced metric suite is a robust framework for studying interactive grounding, and findings highlight areas for improvement in large VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Align-then-Slide, a robust evaluation framework for document-level machine translation that addresses the challenge of evaluating ultra-long outputs from LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing sentence-by-sentence machine translation evaluation methods when dealing with whole-document outputs from large language models.

Method: Align-then-Slide consists of two stages: 1) Align, inferring sentence-level source-target correspondences and reformatting target outputs to resolve discrepancies; 2) Sliding Evaluate, a multi-granularity assessment strategy calculating metric scores across varied chunk sizes.

Result: Experiments demonstrated a high Pearson correlation (0.929) with expert MQM rankings and showed close alignment with human judgments using both benchmark and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Align-then-Slide provides an accurate, robust, and actionable framework for evaluating document-level machine translation, with preference data enabling improvements in model training and translation quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces NE-PADD, a method for detecting partial audio deepfakes using named entity semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve partial audio deepfake detection by leveraging semantic information such as named entities, which remains underexplored.

Method: The approach uses a dual-branch architecture combining SpeechNER and PADD with two innovative attention mechanisms: Attention Fusion (AF) and Attention Transfer (AT).

Result: NE-PADD outperforms existing baselines on the PartialSpoof-NER dataset, demonstrating the benefit of incorporating named entity knowledge.

Conclusion: Named entity knowledge integration enhances partial audio deepfake detection, validated by the superior performance of NE-PADD over baselines.

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces "Drivelology," a linguistic phenomenon of syntactically correct but pragmatically paradoxical or rhetorically layered statements. It highlights how large language models (LLMs) struggle with these complexities and provides a dataset for further exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore the limitations of LLMs in grasping nuanced and layered linguistic phenomena like Drivelology, which goes beyond mere syntactic coherence and requires deeper contextual and pragmatic understanding.

Method: The researchers created a benchmark dataset with over 1,200 examples in multiple languages, involving meticulous expert annotation and adjudication. They evaluated various LLMs on tasks like classification and reasoning using this dataset.

Result: The study found that LLMs frequently misinterpreted Drivelology as shallow nonsense, provided incoherent justifications, or failed to grasp rhetorical functions. This underscores a gap in LLMs' pragmatic language understanding.

Conclusion: The research illustrates the limitations of LLMs in representing nuanced linguistic depth, challenging assumptions about their cognitive understanding. The released dataset aims to guide further advancements in this area.

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

*Yanbo Wang,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Long-CoT reasoning's advancements in large language models and their trustworthiness in five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the impact of CoT-based reasoning techniques on improving or diminishing the trustworthiness of language models across multiple safety dimensions.

Method: The paper surveys existing studies systematically by investigating five core trustworthiness aspects (truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, privacy), analyzing methodologies, findings, and limitations, and provides a chronological overview.

Result: It identifies that while reasoning techniques enhance certain trust aspects like hallucination mitigation and harmful content detection, they also expose models to vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy.

Conclusion: The work highlights the progress and challenges of reasoning models, urging further research for AI safety and providing resources for continued discourse in advancing trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

*Cheng Wang,Zeming Wei,Qin Liu,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the limitations of probing-based methods for detecting harmful instructions in Large Language Models, revealing that current approaches only learn superficial patterns rather than semantic harmfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the safety concerns associated with LLMs' ability to comply with harmful instructions.

Method: A systematic investigation involving controlled experiments, performance comparison with n-gram methods, and a detailed analysis of learned pattern dependencies.

Result: Probing methods fail to capture semantic harmfulness and rely on superficial instructional patterns and trigger words.

Conclusion: Current probing-based approaches provide a false sense of security for LLM safety detection, emphasizing the need to redesign models and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG is a framework that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to address issues in LLM-based mobile agents, such as error handling, environment interaction, and memory limitations, achieving superior results in mobile task automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations of current LLM-based mobile agents, which include errors in task execution, inability to interact with external environments, and lack of memory capabilities.

Method: They design MobileRAG, a framework incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) components: InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG, to improve user query understanding and task execution. They also introduce MobileRAG-Eval for benchmarking performance.

Result: MobileRAG demonstrates a 10.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods in real-world mobile task performance with fewer operational steps, according to experiments using the MobileRAG-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach showcases the potential of RAG in enhancing mobile agent capabilities, enabling them to handle complex tasks with higher efficiency and accuracy while also addressing core limitations.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Matrix of Thought (MoT) and MTQA framework to improve complex Question Answering (QA) using large language models (LLMs), achieving better reasoning performance and accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in complex QA tasks caused by insufficient reasoning capabilities of large language models and the limitations in existing reasoning enhancement methods like Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Method: MoT applies a horizontal and vertical exploration mechanism with 'column-cell communication' in LLM thought structures, coupled with a fact-correction mechanism using knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance reasoning and accuracy.

Result: The Matrix of Thought-based framework (MTQA) outperformed state-of-the-art benchmarks in F1 and EM scores across four datasets, with reasoning time reduced to just 14.4% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Matrix of Thought provides efficient and accurate reasoning for complex QA tasks, demonstrating superiority over existing methods in reasoning capabilities and efficiency.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

TL;DR: KPoEM introduces a dataset for emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry and showcases improved results with fine-tuned Korean language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of research in emotion analysis for Korean poetry, highlighting challenges posed by figurative language and cultural specificity.

Method: The researchers compiled a multi-label dataset from 483 poems and annotated it with 44 fine-grained emotion categories. They fine-tuned a state-of-the-art Korean language model on this dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned KPoEM model achieved an F1-micro score of 0.60, significantly outperforming models trained on general corpora, which achieved a score of 0.34.

Conclusion: KPoEM demonstrates effective computational analysis of emotions in Korean poetry, linking literary analysis with structured data to explore cultural and emotional nuances.

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SelfAug, a method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning scenarios of large language models, specifically in Retrieval-Augmented Generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods often lead to catastrophic forgetting, which hampers the balance between task-specific learning and retaining general capabilities.

Method: SelfAug aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution, preventing catastrophic forgetting and improving task performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show SelfAug effectively balances retaining general capabilities and improving task-specific performance.

Conclusion: SelfAug addresses catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning scenarios, offering a practical and effective solution for diverse applications while advancing understanding in RAG contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPFT-SQL, a self-play fine-tuning method for enhancing Text-to-SQL task performance through iterative data refinement and error-driven learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), its limitations in generating new information and processing a large number of correct SQL queries hinder Text-to-SQL task performance.

Method: SPFT-SQL introduces a verification-based iterative fine-tuning phase to synthesize high-quality data and an error-driven loss mechanism during self-play to focus on distinguishing correct and erroneous SQL.

Result: Experiments across six large language models and five benchmarks demonstrate SPFT-SQL's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL improves Text-to-SQL accuracy by enhancing model training methods and addressing the weaknesses of standard self-play fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Motivation: There is a need to overcome limitations in RPCA research, including the disregard for paralinguistic speech features and the absence of standardized evaluation methods.

Method: The authors created VoxRole using an automated two-stage pipeline that aligns movie audio with scripts and employs an LLM to craft detailed character profiles.

Result: VoxRole includes 13,335 multi-turn dialogues and 65.6 hours of speech, capturing 1,228 characters across 261 movies. It enables evaluation of spoken dialogue models' persona consistency.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals shortcomings and strengths of existing models, addressing a long-standing gap in speech-based persona modeling for RPCAs.

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

### [74] [CANDY: Benchmarking LLMs' Limitations and Assistive Potential in Chinese Misinformation Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03957)
*Ruiling Guo,Xinwei Yang,Chen Huang,Tong Zhang,Yong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CANDY, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check Chinese misinformation, and finds that LLMs often fail in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in fact-checking misinformation, specifically in the context of the Chinese language, as their reliability in this domain remains uncertain.

Method: The authors curated a dataset of approximately 20,000 annotated instances and evaluated current LLMs using chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. They also developed a taxonomy of potential flaws in LLM-generated explanations.

Result: The study found that LLMs have significant limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, with factual fabrication identified as a common failure. However, they show promise in augmenting human performance when used as assistive tools.

Conclusion: LLMs are currently unreliable as standalone tools for fact-checking Chinese misinformation, but they have potential to support human efforts. The dataset and code have been made publicly available.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

*Ulin Nuha,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper focuses on addressing the lack of NLP resources for the low-resource Ladin language by creating synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) and showing their effectiveness in improving translation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of labeled data for extremely low-resource languages, such as indigenous ones like Ladin, limits the effectiveness of NLP tools and technologies. The paper is motivated to bridge this gap by providing foundational resources for an endangered language.

Method: The authors created synthetic datasets by translating monolingual Italian data into Ladin and applied rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures to ensure quality. These datasets were used for both sentiment analysis and MCQA.

Result: The synthetic datasets significantly improved Italian-to-Ladin translation models compared to existing baselines, demonstrating their utility for NLP research and applications.

Conclusion: The paper presents the first publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, laying groundwork for NLP research in this endangered language and enabling broader downstream applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

*Zhaoyan Gong,Juan Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RTQA, a framework for improving temporal knowledge graph question answering by decomposing questions recursively and aggregating answers using multiple paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for TKGQA struggle with complex temporal queries and suffer from limited reasoning abilities and error propagation in decomposition frameworks.

Method: RTQA employs recursive question decomposition, bottom-up solving using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and multi-path answer aggregation to enhance reasoning and fault tolerance.

Result: Experiments on established benchmarks showed significant improvements in Hits@1, particularly for "Multiple" and "Complex" query categories, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The RTQA framework successfully advances temporal knowledge graph question answering capabilities, providing a practical and robust solution without requiring training.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [78] [On Robustness and Reliability of Benchmark-Based Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04013)
*Riccardo Lunardi,Vincenzo Della Mea,Stefano Mizzaro,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) perform consistently when benchmark questions are paraphrased, finding that their effectiveness declines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether benchmark-based evaluations of LLMs accurately reflect their performance in practical scenarios involving linguistic variability.

Method: The researchers generated paraphrased versions of benchmark questions from six common datasets and evaluated the effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs against these paraphrased inputs.

Result: LLM rankings remained stable across paraphrased inputs, but their absolute effectiveness scores declined significantly, highlighting a lack of robustness to linguistic variability.

Conclusion: Existing benchmark evaluations may not adequately capture the real-world performance of LLMs, necessitating the design of robustness-aware benchmarks for better evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the consistency of model outputs across multiple languages using a similarity metric, revealing increasing cross-lingual consistency in larger and more capable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how consistent multilingual models are in their outputs and to evaluate their reliability across different languages.

Method: The authors utilized the model similarity metric κp to analyze responses from models in 20 different languages and across 47 subjects, focusing on consistency patterns.

Result: The study found that as model size and capability grow, their outputs become increasingly consistent across languages. Moreover, models show higher internal cross-lingual consistency compared to their agreement with other models prompted in the same language.

Conclusion: The research underscores the utility of κp for assessing multilingual reliability and suggests it can be used to improve the creation of consistent multilingual systems.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

### [80] [A RoBERTa-Based Functional Syntax Annotation Model for Chinese Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04046)
*Han Xiaohui,Zhang Yunlong,Guo Yuxi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study developed a RoBERTa-based model for Chinese functional syntax annotation and achieved promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of an automatic annotation system for Chinese texts based on Systemic Functional Grammar hinders the application of functional syntax theory in discourse analysis.

Method: The researchers created a dataset of 4,100 annotated sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus, fine-tuned a RoBERTa-Chinese model, and used it for named entity recognition focused on functional syntax elements.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.852, outperforming comparative models, especially in identifying syntactic elements like Subject, Main Verb, and Complement.

Conclusion: This research marks the first application of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, paving the way for future developments in automated Chinese functional syntax analysis.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for synthesizing sheet music problems to train and evaluate AI models in sheet music reasoning, introducing benchmarks and datasets like SSMR-Bench for Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of benchmarks and training datasets for sheet music reasoning in developing AI models with musical interpretation capabilities.

Method: The authors synthesized sheet music problems based on music theory rules, creating textual and visual data for evaluation benchmarks and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Models like Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct showed performance improvements using synthetic data, surpassing GPT-4 in specific benchmarks like MusicTheoryBench.

Conclusion: Synthesizing sheet music problems proves effective for advancing AI reasoning in music interpretation and composition, opening possibilities for AI-assisted music creation.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Motivation: There is a growing use of AI technologies like chatbots in education, driven by the shift to e-learning post-COVID-19 and advancements in NLP, but Arabic educational chatbots remain underexplored.

Method: The study surveys existing Arabic chatbots in the educational sector, categorizing their approaches, linguistic features, and performance evaluation methods.

Result: Few Arabic educational chatbots utilize modern methodologies like Large Language Models, signifying a disparity compared to advancements in English chatbots.

Conclusion: Arabic educational chatbots have untapped potential and require further research to integrate cutting-edge NLP technologies such as LLMs to improve accessibility and effectiveness.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

TL;DR: This study focuses on detecting hidden bias and generating explanations for narratives in news articles using fine-tuned NLP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve understanding and analysis of implicit bias, hidden agendas, and subtle phrasing in news narratives.

Method: A fine-tuned BERT model and recall-oriented approach were used for narrative detection, combined with a ReACT framework and semantic retrieval for generating explanations.

Result: The study achieved improved classification accuracy and reliable narrative justification by integrating structured auxiliary knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance reliability and accuracy in narrative detection and analysis, with significant applications in media analysis and intelligence gathering.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores creating efficient, stable, and personalized lexical profiles for conversational agents to enable lexical alignment, achieving successful communication with minimal data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance human-agent communication by focusing on lexical alignment, an important facet of natural interaction that is underexplored in conversational agents despite advancements in large language models.

Method: The study constructed personalized lexical profiles based on transcribed spoken data, varying both the quantity of data and the number of lexical items per part-of-speech category. Performance was measured using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics over time.

Result: Compact lexical profiles created with minimal data (10 minutes of transcribed speech including limited items per POS category) showed the best balance between performance and data efficiency.

Conclusion: This research provides guidelines for creating data-efficient and stable lexical profiles, advancing the potential for lexical alignment in conversational agents and improving communication effectiveness.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Conclusion: MultiWikiQA is a high-quality benchmark for multilingual reading comprehension, highlighting linguistic diversity and variable model performance. The dataset is freely available for research.

Abstract: We introduce a new reading comprehension dataset, dubbed MultiWikiQA, which
covers 306 languages. The context data comes from Wikipedia articles, with
questions generated by an LLM and the answers appearing verbatim in the
Wikipedia articles. We conduct a crowdsourced human evaluation of the fluency
of the generated questions across 30 of the languages, providing evidence that
the questions are of good quality. We evaluate 6 different language models,
both decoder and encoder models of varying sizes, showing that the benchmark is
sufficiently difficult and that there is a large performance discrepancy
amongst the languages. The dataset and survey evaluations are freely available.

*Wei Liu,Michael Strube*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates combining entity and discourse relation features for text coherence modeling, using a joint approach to improve coherence assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in coherence modeling by jointly incorporating entity and discourse relation features, which are usually studied separately.

Method: Developed two methods to jointly model entities and discourse relations for assessing text coherence.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that combining these features enhances coherence model performance significantly.

Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of simultaneously modeling entities and discourse relations for more accurate coherence evaluation.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

TL;DR: MAGneT introduces a multi-agent framework for generating synthetic psychological counseling sessions, improving quality and diversity compared to single-agent approaches, and significantly enhancing fine-tuning of open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for scalable and high-quality psychological counseling data to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs), as such data is scarce.

Method: The authors propose MAGneT, a multi-agent framework that decomposes counselor response generation into sub-tasks managed by specialized LLM agents, combining structured evaluation metrics.

Result: MAGneT outperformed existing techniques in generated session quality, general counseling skills, and CBT-specific skills, gaining expert preference 77.2% of the time and achieving significant improvement in LLM fine-tuning outcomes.

Conclusion: MAGneT is a robust framework for generating counseling sessions, offering superior alignment with therapeutic practices, improving fine-tuning results, and providing open-source tools and data for future research.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SED-Aug is a dual augmentation framework designed to enhance social event detection from social media by leveraging text-based and feature-space augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges of social event detection, which requires costly annotated data, by proposing a novel augmentation method to reduce the need for extensive labeled datasets.

Method: The authors present SED-Aug, a framework that incorporates text-based augmentation through large language models and feature-space augmentation via five perturbation techniques to diversify and enhance embeddings.

Result: SED-Aug demonstrates significant improvements, outperforming the best baseline by 17.67% on Twitter2012 and 15.57% on Twitter2018 in terms of the average F1 score.

Conclusion: The proposed SED-Aug framework improves social event detection by boosting data diversity and model robustness, providing an effective alternative to costly manual annotations in social media analysis.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Inverse IFEval, a benchmark to assess Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to override cognitive biases and follow unconventional instructions across various domains and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to adapt to instructions that deviate from the conventional patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning. The authors aim to address this limitation and measure adaptability in adversarial contexts.

Method: Inverse IFEval evaluates LLMs using eight challenge types like Question Correction and Counterfactual Answering. It involves a human-in-the-loop pipeline to create a dataset of 1012 high-quality questions in Chinese and English, evaluated with an LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs highlight the utility of the Inverse IFEval benchmark and reveal the significance of adaptability under unconventional instructions.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for future LLM alignment efforts to prioritize instruction-following reliability and adaptability, proposing Inverse IFEval as both a diagnostic tool and a foundation for enhancing LLM behavior under diverse contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

### [90] [Facts Fade Fast: Evaluating Memorization of Outdated Medical Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04304)
*Juraj Vladika,Mahdi Dhaini,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies risks in static training data of LLMs that can lead to outdated medical advice, introduces new QA datasets, evaluates LLM performance, and provides directions for improving medical AI reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have potential for healthcare but rely on static data, risking the use of outdated medical knowledge, which can harm medical decision-making.

Method: The authors created two QA datasets, MedRevQA for general biomedical knowledge and MedChangeQA for cases where medical consensus evolved, then tested eight LLMs against these datasets.

Result: LLMs displayed consistent reliance on outdated medical information in evaluations. The study highlighted the role of obsolete training data and strategies in this issue.

Conclusion: Static training data limits the reliability of LLMs in healthcare. Addressing this requires improved strategies for keeping medical AI systems up-to-date and accurate.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of ASR systems with domain-specific named entities by proposing a novel method, PARCO, to enhance phonetic discrimination and ensure entity retrieval while improving contextual ASR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with recognizing domain-specific named entities, especially homophones, due to limited diversity and a lack of fine-grained phoneme handling.

Method: The authors propose PARCO, which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering to enhance ASR efficiency and accuracy.

Result: PARCO achieves superior performance with a CER of 4.22% on AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on DATA2, while showing robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: The proposed PARCO method effectively improves the contextual ASR performance by addressing the challenges associated with phonetic distinctions, ensuring accurate entity retrieval, and reducing false positives in noisy conditions.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [92] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how specific prompts used in gender bias evaluations of large language models (LLMs) influence measured outcomes, uncovering differences based on prompt saliency and evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs being increasingly deployed in socially impactful areas, understanding and mitigating gender bias in these models has become crucial, especially as bias evaluations use artificial prompts.

Method: The study tested LLMs using various prompt conditions that emphasized either task context or gender focus, assessing bias outcomes across four different task formats using token-probability and discrete-choice metrics.

Result: Minor changes in prompts led to substantial differences in measured bias, sometimes reversing outcomes, with discrete-choice metrics amplifying bias compared to probabilistic metrics.

Conclusion: Evaluations of LLM gender bias are brittle and influenced heavily by prompt design, raising challenges for creating reliable and ecologically valid benchmarks in NLP research.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

*Mutsumi Sasaki,Go Kamoda,Ryosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Sato,Kentaro Inui,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well open-source language models handle the Japanese calendar, finding that they perform poorly in arithmetic tasks and struggle with consistency across calendars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although temporal reasoning in language models has been studied, most research focuses on the Gregorian calendar. The paper aims to address the gap for non-Gregorian systems like the Japanese calendar, which has significant cultural relevance.

Method: The authors construct four datasets for tasks requiring both temporal knowledge and reasoning. They systematically evaluate English-centric and Japanese-centric language models' performance on these tasks.

Result: Some language models show a capability for calendar conversions, but Japanese-centric models struggle with calendar arithmetic and maintaining consistency.

Conclusion: Developing culturally aware language models is essential for improving their ability to handle non-Gregorian calendar systems effectively.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

### [94] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel General Feature Prediction (GFP) framework for self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, emphasizing efficient mask skeleton modeling by replacing low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked autoencoder models for skeleton-based action recognition are limited by their focus on reconstructing raw joint coordinates, which leads to computational inefficiencies and limited semantic capability.

Method: The paper proposes a collaborative learning framework with a lightweight target generation network that dynamically creates supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies. It employs constrained optimization to maintain feature diversity and prevent model collapse.

Result: Experiments show a 6.2× faster training process compared to traditional approaches and state-of-the-art performance in action recognition benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: The GFP framework efficiently improves masked skeleton modeling by predicting high-level features rather than reconstructing low-level data, providing both computational efficiency and superior representation quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Susan Done,Dimitrios Androutsos,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes an AI-based method to address challenges in mitosis detection and classification by focusing on domain generalization and data imbalance, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counting mitotic figures is time-consuming and prone to variability among pathologists. Current AI solutions suffer from domain shift and severe data imbalance in detecting mitosis. This paper aims to improve robustness and accuracy in this challenging task.

Method: The authors employ a teacher-student model based on a UNet segmentation backbone. The approach integrates contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training to address domain generalization. Additionally, it generates pixel-level pseudo-masks for various nuclei types to tackle data imbalance. A multi-task learning paradigm with a multi-scale CNN classifier is used for classification.

Result: The proposed model achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection (Track 1) and a balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification (Track 2) on the preliminary test set.

Conclusion: The unified framework combining segmentation-based detection and classification proves effective for robust mitosis analysis, addressing both domain shift and data imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [96] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a framework designed to address multiple overlapping biases in vision models, enhancing their fairness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision models are impaired by overlapping biases in real-world images, such as textures, watermarks, and gendered makeup. Current methods for addressing individual biases are inadequate, as fixing one bias can exacerbate others.

Method: GMBM consists of a two-stage framework: 1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL), which trains encoders for each bias attribute and incorporates them into the backbone network, compelling the classifier to recognize biases explicitly. 2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning, which removes bias directions learned during the first stage from the backbone’s gradients for unbiased predictions.

Result: GMBM demonstrated superior performance by improving worst-group accuracy, halving multi-attribute bias amplification, and setting a new low in test-time Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) across datasets such as FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, end-to-end solution for handling multiple biases in visual recognition, showing promising results even under challenging biases and distribution shifts.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight U-Net model for left ventricle segmentation in echocardiography that performs comparably to the larger nnU-Net but is faster and requires fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motive is to make segmentation models like nnU-Net more practical and feasible for real-time echocardiography by reducing their size and computational time without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Through an ablation study, the authors analyze which components of nnU-Net contribute most to cardiac segmentation performance. They then optimize the model by focusing on efficient augmentations, architecture, and techniques such as deep supervision.

Result: The authors develop a lightweight U-Net that's 16 times smaller than nnU-Net and 4 times faster, achieving Dice scores statistically equivalent to nnU-Net on the CAMUS dataset for LV/MYO/LA segmentation and comparable generalization on other datasets.

Conclusion: The lightweight U-Net is a promising solution for real-time echocardiographic segmentation as it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements, suggesting its potential utility in clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an updated version of the treeX algorithm, refining it for better accuracy and efficiency in 3D tree instance segmentation using point cloud data, and applies it on a range of datasets as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deep learning methods in tree instance segmentation (high computational demand and annotated dataset requirements) by developing an unsupervised and resource-efficient alternative.

Method: The revised treeX algorithm uses clustering-based stem detection and region growing for crown delineation with tailored parameter presets for ground-based and UAV-borne laser scanning.

Result: Significant accuracy and runtime improvements over the original treeX with F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data, and successful segmentation in UAV-borne data where the original fails.

Conclusion: The updated algorithm offers a viable and efficient alternative for tree instance segmentation in scenarios with sufficient point cloud quality and visibility, while also facilitating label generation for deep learning models.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D introduces a novel framework that incorporates geometry-aware supervision for 3D scene understanding, outperforming existing multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in 3D scene understanding within Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically overcoming the reliance on text-only supervision that lacks geometric constraints.

Method: Reg3D employs a dual-supervision paradigm combining input-level and explicit reconstruction tasks using complementary object-level and frame-level methods within a dual-encoder architecture.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant performance improvements across benchmarks like ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new paradigm in training spatially-aware multimodal models by effectively integrating geometric constraints.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuantV2X, a fully quantized system for efficient multi-modal, multi-agent vehicle-to-everything (V2X) cooperative perception, achieving both efficiency and real-world deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X cooperative perception systems focus heavily on accuracy, often neglecting critical aspects like computational efficiency, latency, and practicality for real-time deployment. High resource demands of full-precision models make them unsuitable for constrained environments.

Method: The authors propose QuantV2X, a quantized multi-agent system employing a unified end-to-end quantization strategy for both neural networks and transmitted messages. This method minimizes computational and bandwidth requirements while preserving accuracy.

Result: QuantV2X reduces system-level latency by 3.2×, improves mAP30 by +9.5 points compared to baselines, and scales effectively to fit within memory budgets for larger models.

Conclusion: QuantV2X demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a fully quantized V2X cooperative system, combining efficiency and scalability without sacrificing accuracy. The system is open-sourced to support further research.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

TL;DR: The paper evaluates three deep learning models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) for automated plant species classification using leaf venation patterns. EfficientNetB0 outperformed the others with the best testing accuracy and F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of deep learning in automating plant taxonomy, focusing on leaf venation patterns, which are critical for species identification.

Method: The Swedish Leaf Dataset, comprising 1,125 images of 15 species, was used to train and test ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.

Result: EfficientNetB0 achieved the highest accuracy (94.67%) and F1 score (>94.6%), outperforming ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, which had lower accuracies and more signs of overfitting.

Conclusion: The study concludes that EfficientNetB0 is the most robust model for venation-based plant species classification, emphasizing the promise of deep learning for scalable and accurate taxonomy tools.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency of traditional graph matching networks for comparing building layout graphs, which involve costly node-level interactions.

Method: The proposed LayoutGKN defers cross-graph node-to-node interactions to the final embedding stage, using a differentiable graph kernel to determine similarity.

Result: LayoutGKN achieves performance comparable to or better than graph matching networks, with a notable improvement in computational speed.

Conclusion: The method optimizes graph comparisons in spatial layouts, providing both speed and accuracy improvements, and releases open-source code and data for accessibility.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [103] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIP-SVD, a novel and efficient method to adapt CLIP models to fine-grained domains by fine-tuning only singular values, achieving superior performance with minimal parameter adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting vision-language models like CLIP to domain-specific tasks is challenging due to reliance on prompt engineering or expensive full model fine-tuning, and the limitations of current adaptation methods.

Method: The authors developed CLIP-SVD by modifying only the singular values of CLIP’s parameter matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), avoiding additional modules and ensuring efficient parameter usage.

Result: CLIP-SVD outperformed prior methods in classification accuracy and generalization across 21 datasets, utilizing only 0.04% of the model's parameters.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD demonstrates that fine-tuning singular values is an effective and efficient strategy for domain adaptation in VLMs, preserving the model's pre-trained knowledge and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel lightweight model for edge-deployed plant disease detection, combining efficient network architecture search (DeepMAD) with a Shape-Texture Attention Module, achieving high performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing global food security needs drive advancements in precision agriculture, but deploying high-performing models on edge devices for plant disease diagnosis remains difficult.

Method: The study employs a two-step approach: creating an efficient network backbone using DeepMAD and incorporating the Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) to improve feature awareness via deformable convolutions and Gabor filters.

Result: In tests on the CCMT dataset, the proposed STA-Net model achieved 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%, outperforming baseline and standard attention models.

Conclusion: Decoupling attention mechanisms for incorporating domain knowledge enables efficient and accurate plant disease detection on edge devices, contributing to precision agriculture advancements.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting camouflaged objects underwater by introducing a benchmark dataset (DeepCamo) and a novel detection framework (SLENet). Experiments show the framework's superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged objects are important for marine ecology but remain hard to detect due to water distortions, turbidity, and organism traits. This paper aims to address this challenge.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework, SLENet, which uses a Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement module and a Localization Guidance Branch to improve multi-scale feature representation. A Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder is guided to make accurate predictions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SLENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the new DeepCamo dataset and three other benchmark datasets. It also proves effective for broader COD tasks.

Conclusion: SLENet, with the DeepCamo dataset, advances the field of underwater camouflaged object detection and generalizes well to other tasks.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [106] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new training strategy that leverages temporal coherence in video frames to improve image diffusion model training. It outperforms conventional methods in terms of convergence speed, generative diversity, and distributional coverage, without requiring changes to model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static image-based training overlooks temporal information inherent in video data, leading to slower training, limited diversity, and weaker generalization.

Method: The proposed method introduces a training strategy that utilizes temporal coherence from continuous video frames during diffusion model training without any architectural modifications.

Result: The method achieves over 2x faster convergence, improves FID scores on training and validation distributions, and increases generative diversity by capturing temporal variations.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal inductive bias from video data can significantly enhance the performance of image diffusion models, offering faster training and better generative quality without altering the model architecture.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D introduces a multi-scale vision-language pretraining framework for addressing diagnostic challenges in 3D CT imaging, achieving state-of-the-art results in several medical AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologic diagnostic errors are common in clinical practice, especially in 3D imaging, due to factors like missed abnormalities, limited context, and variability in report language.

Method: The authors developed MedVista3D, which leverages multi-scale image-text alignment and semantic consistency through language model rewrites and a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank.

Result: MedVista3D demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering while transferring effectively to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction.

Conclusion: MedVista3D addresses key limitations of prior 3D vision-language models by integrating fine-grained local-global context understanding and semantic-aware alignment for improved diagnostic support.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [108] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaPL, a causality-guided text prompt learning method that uses visual granulation to improve CLIP's effectiveness on fine-grained recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the limited capability of existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods in handling fine-grained datasets.

Method: CaPL employs visual granulation and causality-guided inference, featuring an attribute disentanglement module using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model and a granule learning module that employs causal inference strategies to create visual granules.

Result: The CaPL method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning techniques, particularly on fine-grained datasets, validated through experimental results on 15 datasets.

Conclusion: CaPL improves the learning of discriminative text prompts by leveraging visual granules, enhancing performance in fine-grained recognition tasks.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

### [109] [EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03808)
*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses turbulence mitigation (TM) by introducing a novel event-based approach that significantly improves computational efficiency and restoration quality over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TM methods rely on high-capacity networks and synchronous frame inputs, which are computationally and storage-intensive. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and sparse imaging, present an opportunity to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose the 'event-lucky insight,' a correlation between turbulence distortions and event streams. They introduce the EGTM framework that leverages pixel-level guidance from event data for turbulence mitigation. They also create the first real-world event-driven TM dataset for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art TM methods dramatically in efficiency (710x smaller model size, 214x faster inference latency, and 224x lower complexity) while achieving better restoration quality (+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on the authors' real-world dataset.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and advantage of introducing event cameras for TM tasks, achieving significant computational efficiency and improved restoration quality. The method bridges a technological gap and provides resources for further research and application.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

### [110] [Focus Through Motion: RGB-Event Collaborative Token Sparsification for Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03872)
*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FocusMamba, an adaptive collaborative sparsification method for RGB-Event detection that improves computational efficiency while enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RGB-Event detection lack adaptive handling of low-information regions, causing inefficiency and suboptimal performance.

Method: FocusMamba uses an Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to adaptively discard low-information regions and a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module for capturing complementary features.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets (DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD) show that FocusMamba outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed FocusMamba framework successfully balances computational efficiency with accuracy by leveraging adaptive sparsification and effective feature fusion techniques.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces the task of Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), which aims to identify unseen food dishes by considering cuisines and ingredients as compositional attributes. The authors propose the SalientFusion model to address background redundancy, role confusion, and semantic biases, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on new and general benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges in recognizing unseen food categories (Zero-Shot Food Learning) due to the rapid emergence of new dishes. They redefine and align it as Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), inspired by the natural alignment of cuisines and ingredients with attributes.

Method: The authors develop SalientFusion, combining SalientFormer to remove background redundancy and tackle role confusion using depth features, and DebiasAT to reduce semantic bias by aligning attribute prompts with visual features.

Result: SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on two newly proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, as well as on general datasets for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL).

Conclusion: The proposed CZSFR task and SalientFusion model advance food recognition by effectively managing background distractions, ingredient-role confusion, and attribute biases in unseen food categories, providing a novel solution with efficient contextual understanding.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OccTENS, a generative model for predicting 3D scene geometry and dynamics efficiently and accurately over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies, temporal degradation, and lack of controllability in current models for long-term 3D occupancy generation.

Method: They reformulate the task as a Temporal Next-Scale Prediction (TENS) problem and design a TensFormer model for flexible spatial and temporal prediction, along with a pose aggregation strategy for unified ego-motion and occupancy modeling.

Result: OccTENS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of occupancy quality and inference speed based on experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: OccTENS provides a computationally efficient and controllable approach for high-quality 3D occupancy generation, effectively addressing key limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly-supervised model for establishing dense functional correspondences across diverse object categories, leveraging vision-language models and dense contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objects that share functionalities often have similar parts in shape and appearance, motivating the need for dense functional correspondences driven by functionality.

Method: The authors use pseudo-labeling via vision-language models to identify functional parts in multi-view images, combined with dense contrastive learning for pixel correspondence.

Result: The proposed model outperforms baseline methods in both synthetic and real evaluation datasets curated as task benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating functional and spatial knowledge via a weakly-supervised paradigm effectively solves the task of dense functional correspondence, demonstrating superior performance over conventional methods.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Motivation: The paper seeks to address computational inefficiency and overfitting risks in few-shot learning for contrastive vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: Proposes Attn-Adapter, a dual attention mechanism featuring Memory Attn-Adapter for category embedding refinement and Local-Global Attn-Adapter for enriching image embeddings.

Result: Attn-Adapter demonstrates superior performance in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework achieves dynamic online adaptation with efficient inference, ensuring scalability and improved few-shot learning capabilities for CLIP models.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline

limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliable defect detection in wind power plant monitoring using high-resolution data and efficient multispectral analysis methods.

Method: An ensemble approach combining a general-purpose YOLOv8 model and a specialized thermal model, integrated via a bounding box fusion algorithm.

Result: The approach achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming the standalone YOLOv8 model's mAP@.5 of 0.91.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

### [117] [SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897)
*Xiaofu Chen,Israfel Salazar,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Standard metrics struggle with evaluating detailed image captions due to lack of semantic consideration. SPECS tackles this by modifying CLIP and focusing on detail specificity, providing reliable performance while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable, semantic-aware, and computationally efficient metrics for evaluating long and detailed image captions, as current methods either lack accuracy or usability during iterative model development.

Method: SPECS introduces modifications to CLIP, emphasizing specificity by rewarding correct details in captions and penalizing incorrect ones. It achieves this through a revised metric tailored to image captioning.

Result: SPECS shows comparable correlation to human judgments as open-source LLM-based metrics but is far more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SPECS is a practical, effective, and efficient metric for evaluating long image captions, making it ideal for iterative model development processes.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

TL;DR: ChexGen is a generative model for radiograph synthesis that improves AI systems' performance, fairness, and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of well-annotated diverse medical images limits the development of reliable AI models in healthcare.

Method: ChexGen uses a latent diffusion transformer framework with pretraining on 960,000 chest X-ray image-report pairs.

Result: ChexGen successfully synthesizes accurate radiographs and improves disease-related tasks while addressing demographic biases.

Conclusion: Generative foundation models like ChexGen can revolutionize medical AI by making it more accurate, fair, and data-efficient.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework using deep learning, improving compression efficiency over traditional methods and ensuring random access and backward compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive data volumes in multiview video pose challenges in storage and transmission, and current deep learning-based video coding has limited exploration in general multiview scenarios.

Method: Introduced feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction and inter-view motion entropy models to utilize motion correlation, and a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module with inter-view contextual entropy models for content correlation.

Result: The LMVC framework significantly surpasses the compression efficiency of the traditional MV-HEVC standard in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The LMVC framework sets a new benchmark for multiview video coding and paves the way for advancements in efficient multiview data processing.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TopoSculpt, a framework for topological refinement of 3D medical tubular structures, enhancing geometric and topological accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable accurate modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy for applications like bronchoscopic navigation and arterial connectivity, addressing limitations in current voxel-wise overlap and topology-aware approaches.

Method: TopoSculpt employs whole-region modeling, introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint, and uses a curriculum refinement scheme to iteratively correct topological errors.

Result: Experiments on pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets show significant improvements in topology and geometry, with major reductions in errors and enhanced branch detection rates.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects topological errors and improves high-fidelity 3D modeling of tubular anatomy, showcasing its usefulness in medical applications.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a deep-learning pipeline for pneumothorax detection and localization using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate detection of pneumothorax is critical because it can be life-threatening if undetected, and small cases are difficult to identify on chest X-rays.

Method: The proposed model uses a U-Net architecture with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder and is trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset. Data augmentation and a combined binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss function were applied to improve performance.

Result: The model achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.7008 and a Dice score of 0.8241 when tested on the independent PTX-498 dataset.

Conclusion: The deep-learning model demonstrates high accuracy in localizing pneumothorax and provides valuable support for radiologists in diagnosis.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

### [122] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method that improves Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection by forming an adaptive negative textual space with the help of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for OOD detection fail to accurately construct a negative space and often include false negative labels, leading to poor performance in some scenarios.

Method: The authors utilize MLLMs to generate textual descriptions of negative images and reduce false negatives by matching these descriptions to visually similar subsets of in-distribution classes. An adaptive weighted scoring system balances near-OOD and far-OOD detection.

Result: The Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) approach reduces FPR95 by 4.2% on the ImageNet benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed ANTS method effectively improves OOD detection without requiring additional training or task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly scalable and adaptable for various environments.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange, a novel multimodal RSCD method, integrates image and text modalities for superior feature representation, change pattern modeling, and robustness under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RSCD methods relying purely on image modality face challenges in feature representation, change pattern modeling, and handling disturbances like illumination and noise.

Method: MMChange introduces three core modules: IFR for region refinement, VLM and TDE for semantic understanding, and ITFF for deep integration between image and text modalities.

Result: MMChange outperformed state-of-the-art RSCD methods in metrics across datasets like LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD, showing improved accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Integrating text and image modalities through MMChange provides a promising direction for enhanced multimodal RSCD systems.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAC-MIL, a method for WSI classification that integrates spatial encoding and efficient instance correlation techniques, achieving top performance on several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification by incorporating spatial information and addressing computational inefficiencies in handling full-instance correlations.

Method: The proposed method uses a positional encoding module for spatial relationships based on slide coordinates and a linear complexity SAC block for instance correlation using MLP. This design eliminates reliance on complex CUDA-specific implementation, unlike Transformer-based methods.

Result: SAC-MIL outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL leverages spatial context and efficient computation, providing a simpler yet competitive alternative to Transformer-based WSI classification models.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-task learning framework to accurately segment liver vessels in non-contrast MRI, leveraging auxiliary contrast-enhanced MRI data available only during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation in non-contrast MRI is valuable for analyzing vascular remodelling linked to liver diseases but is challenging due to the lack of annotated data and absence of contrast-enhanced imaging sequences.

Method: A multi-task learning framework is proposed using paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data during training, with or without vessel annotations, to improve vessel segmentation performance in non-contrast MRI.

Result: The framework enhanced segmentation accuracy, with the most benefit when few annotations were available. The approach also proved effective for brain tumor segmentation, indicating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: The use of auxiliary imaging data, even if only available during training, improves segmentation tasks while reducing the reliance on large-scale annotated data.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

*Mohamed Insaf Ismithdeen,Muhammad Uzair Khattak,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores prompt sensitivity in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA), introducing a systematic evaluation framework named Promptception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor understanding of how prompt design impacts LMM performance in MCQA tasks and the associated challenges in fair and transparent model evaluation.

Method: The authors created Promptception, a framework with 61 prompt types across various categories, to systematically analyze prompt sensitivity in evaluating 10 LMMs across three MCQA benchmarks.

Result: Proprietary models were found to be more sensitive to prompt phrasing, aligning tightly with instructions, while open-source models were steadier but struggled with complex phrasing.

Conclusion: Prompting Principles specific to proprietary and open-source LMMs were proposed for achieving more robust and fair evaluations of these models.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SliceSemOcc, a framework improving 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving through better utilization of height-axis features and dynamic channel attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D semantic occupancy prediction methods often neglect height-axis information and use uniform weight assignments across height layers, limiting their ability to capture vertical semantic variations.

Method: The authors propose SliceSemOcc, which introduces vertical slice-based voxel feature extraction, global-local fusion for spatial and contextual details, and SEAttention3D module assigning dynamic height-wise attention weights.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes datasets show that SliceSemOcc significantly improves mean IoU, with noticeable benefits for small-object categories.

Conclusion: SliceSemOcc effectively addresses height-axis representation challenges in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, offering substantial performance improvements.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

*Solha Kang,Esla Timothy Anzaku,Wesley De Neve,Arnout Van Messem,Joris Vankerschaver,Francois Rameau,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates and proposes a method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformer models, using experiments on the ImageNet dataset and a real-world case study on invasive breast mass classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations in machine learning models could lead to unreliable predictions by associating incorrect or unintended signals with tasks. Reliable detection and mitigation of these correlations are needed to build trustworthy models.

Method: The authors propose a novel method for detecting spurious correlations in vision transformers, applying it to supervised and self-supervised models. They conduct experiments on the ImageNet dataset and analyze specific spurious signals in certain classes.

Result: Their method successfully identifies spurious correlations, reveals that training methodology affects reliance on spurious signals, and uncovers specific classes and images in ImageNet with unintended correlations.

Conclusion: The authors emphasize caution in using certain ImageNet images in future research, provide a detailed list of flagged images, and demonstrate the real-world implications of detecting spurious signals with a case study.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

*Shiku Kaito,Shinnosuke Matsuo,Daiki Suehiro,Ryoma Bise*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning framework called Learning from Majority Label (LML), which uses majority class labels at the bag level to train classification models and demonstrates its efficacy through a Counting Network and Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scenarios where bag-level majority labels can inform instance-level classification, which is important in fields like medical imaging, political prediction, sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring.

Method: The method involves a Counting Network to predict majority class labels and a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) to improve majority-class proportion by removing minority-class instances.

Result: The experiments across four datasets show the proposed LML approach outperforms conventional MIL methods, and ablation studies validate the contribution of individual modules.

Conclusion: The study presents LML as a promising approach for instance-level classification based on majority class proportions, supported by a clear implementation and code availability for further exploration.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a drone monitoring system with millisecond-level response times using a heterogeneous computing architecture and optimized algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video surveillance systems face significant response delays over 200 ms in dynamic environments due to limited deep feature extraction and computational inefficiency.

Method: A heterogeneous computing system based on Phytium processors and Cambricon accelerator cards was developed, integrating the YOLOv5s detection network with DeepSORT tracking algorithm in a feedback-enabled control loop.

Result: The system achieved single-frame processing delays of 50-100 ms for 1080p video streams, with target recognition accuracy exceeding 98.5%.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an efficient, low-latency, and accurate solution for UAV monitoring, showcasing the potential of domestic chips for real-time applications.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight

*Quang-Huy Che,Le-Chuong Nguyen,Gia-Nghia Tran,Dinh-Duy Phan,Vinh-Tiep Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a re-ranking method using K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) to improve person re-identification by aggregating multi-view features, achieving significant accuracy and computational efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in person re-identification such as pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions caused by view bias from single-view image features.

Method: The method involves generating multi-view features through K-nearest Weighted Fusion, where features of neighbors are aggregated without requiring model fine-tuning or extra annotations.

Result: Experiments on Market1501, MSMT17, and Occluded-DukeMTMC datasets show that the method improves Rank@1 by 9.8% on MSMT17 and 22.0% on Occluded-DukeMTMC, along with computational efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The proposed re-ranking method efficiently enhances person re-identification systems by leveraging multi-view features, demonstrating accuracy improvements and suitability for large-scale datasets.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

*Yaru Chen,Faegheh Sardari,Peiliang Zhang,Ruohao Guo,Yang Xiang,Zhenbo Li,Wenwu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues in Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) tasks by introducing Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) modules, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVVP methods amplify errors by treating noisy pseudo-labels as reliable supervision or letting indiscriminate attention spread them. A better way to handle weakly supervised labels is needed.

Method: The BiT module refines audio-visual features through semantic injection and dynamic calibration, while the CATS module enhances semantic propagation and connection across time.

Result: The proposed method provides state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks LLP and UnAV-100 across key indicators.

Conclusion: Combining semantic injection, calibration, propagation, and connection addresses the deficiencies of previous methods, improving AVVP task outcomes with weak labels.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet the demands of real-time perception in ADAS, models need to balance computational efficiency with performance and scalability to ensure safety and practicality.

Method: The paper introduces TriLiteNet, a model optimized for multi-task driving perception, evaluated on metrics like vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation using minimal resources.

Result: TriLiteNet achieves high recall and accuracy across tasks (85.6% vehicle detection recall, 92.4% mIoU for drivable areas, and 82.3% lane line accuracy) while being computationally efficient (down to 0.14M parameters).

Conclusion: TriLiteNet succeeds in offering a practical multi-task perception model for ADAS, combining high performance with low computational demand suitable for embedded systems.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TriLiteNet.

Conclusion: DVS-PedX offers a valuable resource for advancing event-based pedestrian perception, revealing opportunities for improvement in spiking neural networks and domain adaptation.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TaleDiffusion, a framework for generating consistent multi-character story visualizations, overcoming issues like character inconsistency and dialogue inaccuracies in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in text-to-story visualization, especially issues related to character consistency, artifact generation, and inaccurate dialogue rendering.

Method: The framework uses a pre-trained LLM for per-frame descriptions, a bounded attention-based mask technique, identity-consistent self-attention, region-aware cross-attention, and post-processing with CLIPSeg for dialogue assignment.

Result: TaleDiffusion surpasses existing methods in ensuring character consistency, reducing artifacts, and accurately rendering dialogue bubbles.

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion effectively solves key problems in text-to-story visualization, showing significant improvements over previous methods in generating coherent multi-character stories.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEPG, a framework addressing limitations in text-to-image diffusion models like multi-element prompts and stylistic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating complex prompt interpretations and stylistic diversity, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed MEPG framework integrates Position-Style Aware LLMs with spatial-semantic expert modules, allowing for dynamic routing across regional and global image partitions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models in terms of image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: MEPG enables enhanced text-to-image generation with more precise spatial coordination and rich stylistic variation, surpassing existing models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper re-evaluates an existing deepfake detection method with optimized hyperparameters, achieving 81% accuracy on an 'in-the-wild' benchmark, surpassing prior models and approaching commercial detector performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need for accessible and effective deepfake detectors to fit real-world settings, especially for emerging benchmarks like Deepfake-Eval-2024.

Method: The study revisits baseline deepfake detection models using standard vision backbones and refines their hyperparameters to improve accuracy on less controlled datasets.

Result: With the proposed hyperparameter optimization, the method achieves 81% accuracy on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, outperforming earlier results by 18% and nearing commercial detector performance.

Conclusion: Proper tuning of baseline models can make them competitive with commercial detectors for practical deployment scenarios, balancing accuracy and computational feasibility.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web tool that automates image labeling using advanced AI models, aiming to improve annotation efficiency with minimal human involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of labor-intensive and manually intensive data annotation, which restricts the scalability of labeling large datasets for AI models.

Method: VisioFirm incorporates state-of-the-art models (such as CLIP, Grounding DINO, and Ultralytics) into an interactive interface. It utilizes AI for initial annotations, followed by user refinement, while also offering advanced tools like segmentation and efficient anonymization approaches.

Result: The tool reduces human annotation efforts by up to 90% while maintaining highly accurate labels. This is verified using benchmarks on diverse datasets and incorporates features like low-confidence filtering and connected component clustering.

Conclusion: By offering AI-assisted annotation, VisioFirm significantly enhances the scalability and efficiency of data labeling processes. It provides offline accessibility and supports numerous export formats, making it a practical solution for various labeling tasks.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

TL;DR: DUDE is a new method for cross-domain image retrieval which uses feature disentanglement to separate object features from domain styles, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCIR methods often struggle with aligning cross-domain features due to the entanglement of object features with domain-specific styles, necessitating innovative approaches.

Method: DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model for disentangling object and domain features, followed by progressive mutual neighbor alignment across domains.

Result: Experiments show DUDE outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets spanning 13 domains.

Conclusion: DUDE offers a significant advancement in UCIR, effectively addressing domain gap issues with promising potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LASER, a framework improving Vision Language Models (VLMs) for precise region-focused reasoning in GUI tasks, establishing a new performance benchmark on ScreenSpot-Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in enabling VLMs to reason over key image regions in tasks involving high-resolution and complex multi-element inputs.

Method: Introduces LASER framework using Monte Carlo estimation and IoU-based evaluation to guide VLMs towards accurate and diverse region focus while adapting to task complexities.

Result: LASER demonstrates consistent performance gains on ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 55.7 score on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Conclusion: LASER effectively improves VLMs' reasoning and perception capabilities, advancing GUI task performance and setting a new standard for 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper integrates differential morphological profile (DMP) features into advanced semantic segmentation networks to improve remote sensing image analysis, focusing on challenges such as shape extraction and extreme scale variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing imagery segmentation faces unique challenges like extreme scale variation and foreground-background imbalance that are not addressed by networks optimized for ground-perspective photographs.

Method: The paper incorporates DMP, which extracts multi-scale shape features, into segmentation architectures using direct input and hybrid dual-stream designs that fuse RGB and DMP channels. Performance is tested on the iSAID dataset with varied structuring elements.

Result: Hybrid DMP architectures consistently outperformed direct-input models and demonstrated the capability to surpass non-DMP models on metrics like mIoU, F1, and Recall.

Conclusion: Integrating DMP improves semantic segmentation performance in remote sensing imagery and offers a promising method for addressing segmentation challenges in this domain.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D diffusion model to synthesize tau PET images using MRI data and plasma biomarkers, offering a cost-effective alternative to existing methods for studying Alzheimer's disease progression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and limited availability of tau PET scans in diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease, and to leverage readily available and non-invasive tools like structural MRI and plasma biomarkers.

Method: A 3D diffusion model guided by textual prompts from plasma p-tau217 measurements, combined with structural MRI data, is proposed to synthesize 3D tau PET images.

Result: The model successfully generates realistic and clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images, validated using AV1451 tau PET data from the ADNI database.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-effective, non-invasive tool for visualizing tau pathology, augmenting tau PET data, and simulating Alzheimer's disease progression under varying biomarkers and cognitive scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

*Junying Meng,Gangxuan Zhou,Jun Liu,Weihong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that incorporates spatial regularization methods and volume priors to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current segmentation networks fail to effectively utilize feature extraction methods and important prior information from datasets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The approach integrates a regression network to estimate target region volumes for unlabeled images. These estimations are used with an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint to regularize segmentation results. Additionally, a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function enforces similarity in volume distribution between labeled and unlabeled datasets.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on three benchmark datasets: 2017 ACDC, PROMISE12, and a thigh muscle MR image dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of spatial regularization and volume priors significantly enhances feature extraction and segmentation accuracy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

*Jianning Deng,Kartic Subr,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework to learn articulated object representations using sparse-view and unposed images without requiring dense observations or camera pose supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely heavily on dense multi-view observations and accurate camera pose data, which may not be available in many applications, necessitating a framework that works with limited input data.

Method: The method involves sparse-view 3D reconstruction for individual articulations, learning a deformation field to create dense correspondences, applying a disentanglement strategy to separate static and moving parts, and optimizing geometry, appearance, and kinematics using self-supervised loss functions.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world data show that the approach produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under weaker input conditions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in sparse and unposed image learning, paving the way for applications with minimal input requirements and robust performance.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using synthetic images from text-to-image models as reference points to correct mislabeled samples in noisy image datasets. It effectively improves classification accuracy under semantic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of semantic noise in image classification datasets caused by visually similar but mislabeled categories, which hampers the performance of traditional supervised learning.

Method: The researchers use high-quality synthetic images with reliable labels as reference points to detect and rectify mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. This approach is integrated with state-of-the-art noise-robust training techniques.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated significant improvement in classification accuracy on benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 30% on CIFAR-10, 11% on CIFAR-100 under semantic noise, and 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.

Conclusion: The method is effective in addressing semantic label noise, enhancing classification accuracy, and is compatible with existing noise-robust training approaches for further performance boosts.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an efficient model for odd-one-out anomaly detection, reducing parameters and training time significantly compared to the state-of-the-art, while retaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in spatial and relational reasoning necessary for identifying odd-looking instances in multi-object scenes.

Method: Proposes a DINO-based model optimized for efficiency, reducing parameters and training duration by significant margins compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Achieves competitive performance while being more computationally efficient; also introduces a baseline using a Multimodal Large Language Model.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows that odd-one-out anomaly detection can be performed efficiently, highlighting limitations in current large language models for structured visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

### [147] [GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-language Models on WorldWide Image Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04334)
*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoArena, an open evaluation platform to address data leakage and metric limitations in assessing LVLMs for image geolocalization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for global image geolocalization face issues like data leakage from pretrained models and inadequate privacy-conscious metrics.

Method: GeoArena enables diverse evaluation by accepting user-submitted images and employs human judgments for model comparison instead of relying solely on geographic coordinates.

Result: GeoArena has compiled thousands of human voting records, allowing for detailed analysis and establishment of a performance leaderboard for LVLMs.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a more accurate and human-aligned evaluation framework for image geolocalization tasks, addressing prior limitations in methodology and privacy.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

*JiYuan Wang,Chunyu Lin,Lei Sun,Rongying Liu,Lang Nie,Mingxing Li,Kang Liao,Xiangxiang Chu,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how editing models outperform generative models for dense geometry estimation and introduces the FE2E framework, achieving notable improvements in performance without extensive data scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether image-editing models are better suited than text-to-image generative models for dense geometry estimation tasks.

Method: The authors reformulated the editor's loss function into a 'consistent velocity' objective, applied logarithmic quantization for precision issues, and leveraged Diffusion Transformer's global attention to simultaneously estimate depth and normals.

Result: FE2E achieves significant zero-shot improvements in monocular depth and normal estimation on multiple datasets, including a 35% gain on the ETH3D dataset, surpassing methods using 100 times more training data.

Conclusion: The FE2E framework demonstrates that editing models offer a superior foundation for dense prediction tasks, showcasing performance and stability advantages over generative models.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

### [149] [MICACL: Multi-Instance Category-Aware Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04344)
*Feng-Qi Cui,Zhen Lin,Xinlong Rao,Anyang Tong,Shiyao Li,Fei Wang,Changlin Chen,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MICACL, a multi-instance learning framework for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) that addresses issues of long-tailed distributions and complex spatio-temporal modeling to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DFER models often suffer from biases due to challenges like uneven category distributions and difficulty in spatio-temporal relationship modeling.

Method: MICACL employs a Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM), Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN), and Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to optimize spatio-temporal feature modeling and balance category training.

Result: Experiments conducted on datasets like DFEW and FERV39k establish MICACL as achieving state-of-the-art robustness and generalization in in-the-wild DFER tasks.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively addresses model bias and improves performance by innovating methods for spatio-temporal feature representation and handling long-tailed category distribution.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

*Dor Cohen,Inga Efrosman,Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computer vision pipeline to summarize body-camera footage into panoramic images for effective situational awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders face challenges in reviewing lengthy video footage during time-critical situations, necessitating concise visual summaries.

Method: The paper employs monocular SLAM to estimate camera trajectories, clusters camera poses for key viewpoints, selects representative frames, and fuses them using multi-frame stitching to create spatially coherent panoramas.

Result: The method produces informative panoramic images summarizing incident scenes to aid rapid understanding and decision-making.

Conclusion: By transforming lengthy footage into concise panoramic summaries, the approach enhances situational awareness and facilitates incident review for first responders.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

*Hao Ju,Hu Zhang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AnomalyLMM, a novel framework leveraging Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) for text-based person anomaly search, achieving better recall accuracy and interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing public safety need for identifying individuals exhibiting abnormal behaviors using natural language descriptions, while overcoming challenges like fine-grained cross-modal alignment and anomaly recognition under sparse data.

Method: The paper proposes a coarse-to-fine LMM-based pipeline and a training-free adaptation strategy using masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking.

Result: The method surpasses the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 on the PAB dataset and demonstrates visually interpretable alignment between textual and visual anomalies.

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM effectively bridges the gap between generative LMMs and retrieval tasks, setting a foundation for text-based anomaly search and advancing future research in this domain.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

*Yilin Tao,Jiashui Huang,Huaze Xu,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM) for better Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research primarily focuses on predicting aesthetic ratings and has limited application in Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC). There is a gap in specifically adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for generating textual aesthetic descriptions.

Method: The paper proposes ASE-MLLM, an end-to-end framework incorporating aesthetic saliency into MLLMs via the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM). This includes IAS-ViT as an image encoder leveraging cross-attention to fuse aesthetic saliency features with original image features.

Result: ASE-MLLM outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs across current Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The integration of aesthetic saliency features efficiently enhances MLLMs for AIC tasks, offering a novel and effective approach in computational aesthetics.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

### [153] [SSGaussian: Semantic-Aware and Structure-Preserving 3D Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04379)
*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 3D style transfer pipeline that utilizes pretrained 2D diffusion models to address limitations in existing methods by enhancing high-level style semantics and improving structural clarity in stylized scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in extracting high-level style semantics and ensuring structural clarity and separation in existing 3D style transfer methods.

Method: The method involves two stages: leveraging 2D diffusion model priors to create stylized renderings of key viewpoints, and transferring these stylized views onto 3D representations using cross-view style alignment and instance-level style transfer.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods in stylistic fidelity, structural coherence, and instance-level consistency across a variety of 3D scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates 2D diffusion models into 3D style transfer, yielding visually enhanced and structurally consistent 3D scenes, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

*Tingyou Li,Zixin Xu,Zirui Gao,Hanfei Yan,Xiaojing Huang,Jizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised method for simultaneous probe and object reconstruction in X-ray ptychography, which improves image reconstruction, particularly in low-signal scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray ptychography's potential is limited by challenges in accurate image reconstruction when the illuminating probe is unknown, especially under low-signal conditions in low-dose or high-speed experiments.

Method: The authors propose PtyINR, a self-supervised framework that represents both the object and probe as continuous neural fields, enabling end-to-end recovery directly from raw diffraction data without probe pre-characterization.

Result: Extensive testing shows PtyINR achieves better reconstruction quality on simulated and real-world data, with strong robustness in low-signal conditions.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a physics-informed and generalizable solution to probe-dependent inverse problems, enhancing the practicality and adoption of X-ray ptychography in various fields.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced method for constructing safety-focused multimodal datasets, addressing complexities in real-world scenarios and introducing a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset construction methods fail to effectively address the complexities of real-world multimodal safety scenarios and lack standardized evaluation metrics.

Method: An image-oriented self-adaptive method was proposed, starting with images and generating paired text and guidance responses to build a dataset.

Result: An RMS dataset of 35k image-text pairs was generated and a safety judge model was fine-tuned to assess effectiveness across various tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: The image-oriented approach demonstrated scalability and effectiveness, contributing significantly to real-world multimodal safety dataset construction and evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MDT-dist, a novel framework for reducing inference sampling steps in 3D flow generation models, leveraging Velocity Matching and Velocity Distillation for optimized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating 3D generation tasks by reducing the high sampling requirements of flow-based models, inspired by advances in 2D diffusion model distillation.

Method: The MDT-dist framework employs Marginal-Data Transport learning, translating it into feasible Velocity Matching and Velocity Distillation strategies to optimize sampling efficiency.

Result: MDT-dist achieves significant speedups (up to 9.0x) with reduced latency (0.68s or 0.94s) while maintaining high-quality outputs on the TRELLIS framework.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently reduces computation steps in 3D generation, outperforming existing distillation methods for few-step sampling while preserving fidelity in visual and geometric dimensions.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

TL;DR: Durian introduces a zero-shot method to animate portrait videos with facial attribute transfer using diffusion models and dual reference networks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent facial attribute transfer across portrait animation videos in a zero-shot manner.

Method: Dual reference networks inject spatial features from portrait and attribute images into the diffusion model's denoising process using self-reconstruction and mask expansion with keypoint-conditioned image generation.

Result: Durian achieves high-quality attribute transfer in portrait animation videos and supports multi-attribute composition without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates its effectiveness in generalizing across diverse attributes and reference combinations, ensuring robustness and achieving state-of-the-art results for portrait animation with zero-shot attribute transfer.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

TL;DR: This study introduces a deep learning method that incorporates a differentiable Hough transform to effectively detect and segment collimator shadows in X-ray imaging, achieving refined segmentation masks with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting collimator shadows in X-ray imaging, especially when shadows are obscured by scattered radiation, and to minimize radiation dose while accurately pre-processing the region of interest.

Method: The study incorporates a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect polygonal-shaped collimation borders and combines this detection with information about the region of interest's center during inference to produce line-constrained segmentation masks.

Result: The method robustly reconstructs collimated regions, achieving a median Hausdorff distance of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real X-ray images.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of detecting collimator shadows and is adaptable to various edge counts, proving it can produce accurate segmentation masks for X-ray imaging applications.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Motivation: Existing unified models for visual understanding and generation lack mechanisms to evaluate consistency between understanding and generation tasks, especially when alternating between modalities.

Method: The authors propose a cyclic evaluation framework (UCF-UM) with three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), and Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG). They also introduce a benchmark dataset called ND400 for evaluation.

Result: The UCF-UM evaluation revealed varying levels of cross-modal stability among models, with some like BAGEL maintaining semantic fidelity better than others such as Vila-u.

Conclusion: Cyclic consistency is crucial for assessing unified models, and the metrics and framework proposed offer practical tools for measuring cross-modal representation stability.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys recent advancements in panoramic vision, focusing on the challenges of adapting perspective techniques to omnidirectional images (ODIs), and provides a comprehensive review of methods and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the growing demand for holistic scene perception enabled by omnidirectional images, which face unique challenges compared to traditional perspective images due to their geometric and spatial disparities.

Method: The paper conducts a survey of 300+ research papers, categorizing strategies and methods into four dimensions: visual quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal understanding, and visual generation. It also emphasizes cross-method and cross-task analyses to identify solutions for domain adaptation.

Result: The survey identifies three main challenges for panoramic vision: geometric distortions near poles, non-uniform sampling in ERP, and boundary continuity issues. It provides a synthesis of current strategies and solutions for these challenges across various tasks.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the state of the art in panoramic vision, elaborates open challenges, and discusses future research directions to drive the development of more effective panoramic vision technologies.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance control, refinement, and consistent modification of generated visuals in story visualization using diffusion models.

Method: Propose a zero-shot framework named Plot'n Polish for maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames while enabling precise edits.

Result: Plot'n Polish addresses challenges in providing flexibility for fine/coarse edits while ensuring coherence in story visualization.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish bridges the gap for creators seeking detailed control and consistency in crafting visual stories.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal misinformation detection faces challenges, especially in unseen scenarios. This study introduces TRUST-VL, a unified vision-language model, leveraging a novel visual module and a large dataset to enhance detection accuracy, generalization, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing threat of multimodal misinformation facilitated by generative AI, and the existing difficulty in handling diverse distortion types within unseen contexts.

Method: The researchers propose TRUST-VL, a unified model that combines reasoning across distortion types and employs a Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module. Additionally, they construct TRUST-Instruct, a 198K-sample dataset designed for structured reasoning in misinformation detection.

Result: TRUST-VL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks, with improved generalization and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Joint training across distortion types and structured reasoning datasets enhance the model's ability to detect and explain multimodal misinformation effectively in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a video generative model for creating long virtual try-on videos efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of creating long virtual try-on videos, ensuring smooth transitions and consistent human appearance without excessive computational resources.

Method: The VFR framework models generation auto-regressively, leveraging prefix video conditions for smoothness and a 360-degree anchor video for temporal consistency.

Result: VFR successfully generates minute-long virtual try-on videos, maintaining both smooth transitions and consistent appearances during various motions.

Conclusion: This work pioneers efficient methods for long virtual try-on video generation, demonstrating advancements in realism and usability.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

*Siddharth Samsi,Dan Campbell,Emanuel Scoullos,Oded Green*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the latest HPEC Graph Challenge, focusing on performance improvements for anonymized network sensing graphs using the NVIDIA RAPIDS ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HPC benchmarks like LINPACK fail to represent aspects of modern, complex workloads. The latest HPEC Graph Challenge emphasizes realistic end-to-end workloads that involve graph data processing and network analysis, showcasing areas where current HPC systems face challenges.

Method: The authors utilized off-the-shelf ETL tools from NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem (cuDF and cupy) to reformulate the GraphBLAS computational aspects of the challenge in data science language, achieving significant acceleration. GPU performance was benchmarked against CPU-based Pandas operations.

Result: Using NVIDIA RAPIDS tools, performance speedups ranged from 147x to 2185x depending on the GPU model (A100, H100, H200), showing dramatic improvements in workload handling without specialized HPC code.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that leveraging accessible, open-source enterprise tools like RAPIDS can significantly enhance graph processing performance, enabling efficient tackling of HPC challenges even without specific HPC-focused programming.

Abstract: The HPEC Graph Challenge is a collection of benchmarks representing complex
workloads that test the hardware and software components of HPC systems, which
traditional benchmarks, such as LINPACK, do not. The first benchmark, Subgraph
Isomorphism, focused on several compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. The
most recent of the challenges, the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,
represents a shift in direction, as it represents a longer end-to-end workload
that requires many more software components, including, but not limited to,
data I/O, data structures for representing graph data, and a wide range of
functions for data preparation and network analysis. A notable feature of this
new graph challenge is the use of GraphBLAS to represent the computational
aspects of the problem statement. In this paper, we show an alternative
interpretation of the GraphBLAS formulations using the language of data
science. With this formulation, we show that the new graph challenge can be
implemented using off-the-shelf ETL tools available in open-source, enterprise
software such as NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem. Using off-the-shelf software,
RAPIDS cuDF and cupy, we enable significant software acceleration without
requiring any specific HPC code and show speedups, over the same code running
with Pandas on the CPU, of 147x-509x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, 243x-1269X for an
NVIDIA H100 GPU, and 332X-2185X for an NVIDIA H200 GPU.

*John Augustine,Soumyottam Chatterjee,Valerie King,Manish Kumar,Shachar Meir,David Peleg*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper focuses on distributed data retrieval with $k$ peers aiming to access an array of $n$ bits. It introduces protocols that reduce query complexity for nonfaulty peers under asynchronous communication networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize query complexity in distributed systems while ensuring robustness against faults in asynchronous communication networks.

Method: The authors develop query-optimal deterministic solutions for crash faults and analyze randomized protocols for Byzantine faults in asynchronous environments.

Result: The paper provides deterministic protocols for crash faults and establishes a query complexity lower bound for Byzantine faults in randomized settings. It also proposes a randomized protocol with near-optimal complexity for $
Beta < 1/2$.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the study of the Download problem in asynchronous networks, offering critical insights into handling faults with minimized query complexity.

Abstract: The distributedData Retrieval (DR) model consists of $k$ peers connected by a
complete peer-to-peer communication network, and a trusted external data source
that stores an array $\textbf{X}$ of $n$ bits ($n \gg k$). Up to $\beta k$ of
the peers might fail in any execution (for $\beta \in [0, 1)$). Peers can
obtain the information either by inexpensive messages passed among themselves
or through expensive queries to the source array $\textbf{X}$. In the DR model,
we focus on designing protocols that minimize the number of queries performed
by any nonfaulty peer (a measure referred to as query complexity) while
maximizing the resilience parameter $\beta$.
  The Download problem requires each nonfaulty peer to correctly learn the
entire array $\textbf{X}$. Earlier work on this problem focused on synchronous
communication networks and established several deterministic and randomized
upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to extend the study of
distributed data retrieval to asynchronous communication networks. We address
the Download problem under both the Byzantine and crash failure models. We
present query-optimal deterministic solutions in an asynchronous model that can
tolerate any fixed fraction $\beta<1$ of crash faults. In the Byzantine failure
model, it is known that deterministic protocols incur a query complexity of
$\Omega(n)$ per peer, even under synchrony. We extend this lower bound to
randomized protocols in the asynchronous model for $\beta \geq 1/2$, and
further show that for $\beta < 1/2$, a randomized protocol exists with
near-optimal query complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to address the Download problem in asynchronous communication networks.

*Avisek Sharma,Satakshi Ghosh,Buddhadeb Sau*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gathering problem for robots on a circle with $\pi$-visibility and proposes an algorithm for robots with finite communication ability operating under a fully asynchronous scheduler with non-rigid movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenging gathering problem for autonomous robots with limited visibility ($\pi$-visibility), non-rigid movements, and working under a fully asynchronous scheduler, a scenario where conventional approaches fail.

Method: The proposed algorithm utilizes finite communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$) to enable robots with $\pi$-visibility, operating in non-rigid movement scenarios, to achieve gathering under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

Result: The algorithm successfully solves the gathering problem under conditions involving $\pi$-visibility, non-rigid movement, and an asynchronous scheduler, a feat not achieved in prior works.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of gathering problems by overcoming strict visibility and movement constraints, demonstrating that finite communication can enable practical solutions under asynchronous conditions.

Abstract: This work addresses the gathering problem for a set of autonomous, anonymous,
and homogeneous robots with limited visibility operating in a continuous
circle. The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a
rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise
direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots
on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna
\textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is
impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$
visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$
visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is
removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a
gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory
($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.
  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be
done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous
scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one
point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots
had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite
communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$). In this work the robot movement is
non-rigid and the robots work under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

TL;DR: The paper introduces scalable algorithms for counterfactual analysis in large-scale systems with burnout variables by enabling efficient parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and scalability challenges in simulating counterfactual scenarios for systems impacted by burnout variables, such as budget-limited online advertising campaigns.

Method: Developed an algorithmic approach called uncertainty relaxation that allows for efficient parallel computation to handle burnout variable dynamics.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in scalability and computational efficiency for counterfactual estimation in relevant systems.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms show promise for applications in systems with burnout constraints, addressing a key computational bottleneck in counterfactual analysis.

Abstract: We consider large-scale systems influenced by burnout variables - state
variables that start active, shape dynamics, and irreversibly deactivate once
certain conditions are met. Simulating what-if scenarios in such systems is
computationally demanding, as alternative trajectories often require sequential
processing, which does not scale very well. This challenge arises in settings
like online advertising, because of campaigns budgets, complicating
counterfactual analysis despite rich data availability. We introduce a new type
of algorithms based on what we refer to as uncertainty relaxation, that enables
efficient parallel computation, significantly improving scalability for
counterfactual estimation in systems with burnout variables.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LowDiff is a framework for efficient checkpointing in distributed deep-learning model training, focusing on minimizing costs and improving performance during frequent checkpointing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent checkpointing during distributed training of deep-learning models is essential for recovery from failures, but it incurs significant costs and degrades performance.

Method: LowDiff introduces compressed gradients as differential checkpoints, batched gradient write optimization, dynamic adjustment of checkpoint frequency, layer-wise gradient reuse, snapshotting, and asynchronous persistence strategies.

Result: Experiments confirm LowDiff enables frequent checkpointing per iteration with runtime overheads below 3.1%, showcasing its efficiency and practicality even across various workloads.

Conclusion: LowDiff successfully reduces checkpointing costs while maintaining training performance, making frequent checkpointing feasible and efficient for distributed systems.

Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures,
so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies
focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it
generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading
training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to
reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application
to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework
that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints
to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write
optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also
dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to
maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient
reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence
strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression.
Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing
frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\% runtime overhead.

*Serafino Cicerone,Alessia Di Fonso,Gabriele Di Stefano,Alfredo Navarra*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of unlimited computational power for synchronous robots in the OBLOT model, enabling optimal resolution for a broad set of tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In swarm robotics, the OBLOT model emphasizes limited robot capabilities which complicates algorithm design. The paper investigates how addressing computational power can transform outcomes.

Method: The authors assess synchronous robots on finite graphs and utilize the assumption of unlimited computational power to propose optimized algorithms.

Result: They demonstrate that unlimited computational power enables minimal moves and rounds for a wide class of problems in the OBLOT model.

Conclusion: Leveraging computational power improves the OBLOT model's efficiency, offering definitive algorithms for swarm robotics challenges.

Abstract: The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics.
It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are
anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their
only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,
i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of
distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous
research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished
within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed
computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is
neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the
number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove
that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited
computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,
by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to
a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and
rounds.

*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel class of optimisers for neural networks based on a Riemannian geometric perspective, demonstrating empirical effectiveness and computational efficiency similar to Adam.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural network optimisers by leveraging the Riemannian metric induced by embedding the loss landscape in a higher-dimensional space, specifically aiming for better performance, natural gradient adjustments, and simpler integration with existing methods.

Method: The method uses the Riemannian geometric viewpoint of the neural network loss landscape to create an optimiser that adjusts learning rates based on curvature and integrates features like gradient clipping and scheduled learning rates. The optimiser is computationally efficient and compatible with existing preconditioning methods.

Result: The proposed optimiser shows high effectiveness in low-dimensional problems and slight performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods (SGD, Adam, AdamW, Muon) across various tasks and architectures.

Conclusion: The new optimiser provides theoretical and practical advantages, such as adaptive learning rate adjustments based on curvature and natural decoupling of weight decay. It is a versatile and computationally efficient option for improving neural network training.

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose AI model for electronic health records (EHRs), integrating feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for EHRs are often task-specific, limiting their applicability and generalizability in diverse healthcare scenarios.

Method: CEHR-GPT integrates a time-token-based learning framework to handle temporal data in EHRs, supporting feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation within one model.

Result: CEHR-GPT performs well across multiple tasks, generalizes effectively to external data, and allows functionality without extensive retraining.

Conclusion: CEHR-GPT is a versatile tool for EHR analysis, offering utility for rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome prediction in healthcare.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

*E. Khalafyan,A. E. Allahverdyan,A. Hovhannisyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of the Common Cause (PCC), applying these methods to image datasets for robust rank estimation, feature stability, clustering, and data denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance NMF's effective rank estimation, address the NMF nonidentifiability problem, and explore PCC's potential in clustering and probabilistic causality.

Method: The paper maps image datasets into probability models, uses PCC for rank estimation in NMF, stabilizes feature extraction against noise, develops a clustering strategy based on common causes, and leverages NMF for data denoising.

Result: PCC offers a robust and noise-stable method for estimating NMF's rank, stabilizing extracted features. NMF, in turn, facilitates approximate PCC implementation, clustering, and data denoising, demonstrating excellent resistance to noise and local optimization seeds.

Conclusion: Integrating NMF with probabilistic causality principles not only enhances rank and feature stability but also provides robust clustering and denoising methods, bridging methodologies in data reduction and causality modeling.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

*Yixiong Ren,Wenkang Du,Jianhui Zhou,Haiping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents a novel framework to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness by promoting smooth internal representations in deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing training accuracy and adversarial robustness in deep learning remains a significant challenge.

Method: A geometry-aware deep learning framework with layer-wise local training is introduced, emphasizing intra-class compactness and inter-class separation for smoothness in feature space.

Result: The framework renders deep neural networks robust to adversarial white and black box attacks, with performance backed by an energy model with Hebbian coupling.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of learning physics, aligning features of biological and artificial intelligence systems, and supports effective assimilation of new data into existing network structures.

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedDeCAB, a semi-decentralized client selection method for federated learning that uses probabilistic rankings to enhance model performance under dynamic client availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of limited energy, availability budgets, and data heterogeneity among IoT clients in federated learning.

Method: FedDeCAB uses probabilistic rankings for client selection and allows partial model parameter sharing from nearest neighbors when clients are offline.

Result: Experiments on large-scale taxi and vessel trajectory datasets show FedDeCAB's effectiveness under data heterogeneity, limited communication, and dynamic client availability.

Conclusion: FedDeCAB improves offline model performance, enhances federated learning convergence, and reduces communication overhead in challenging IoT settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in uniform-reward RLHF and proposes SharedRep-RLHF to improve fairness by leveraging shared traits in annotations, demonstrating superior performance over MaxMin-RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback where uniform reward models favor dominant groups and fail to capture subpopulation diversity.

Method: The SharedRep-RLHF framework integrates shared traits from annotations across groups instead of learning group-specific reward models, alongside theoretical analysis and sample complexity quantification.

Result: Experiments show SharedRep-RLHF achieves up to 20% better win rate compared to MaxMin-RLHF across various NLP tasks.

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF mitigates drawbacks of existing methods, enhances fairness, and showcases significant performance improvements, marking progress in equitable RLHF systems.

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Result: The model achieved tangible improvements including a 30% increase in inventory turnover, reduced SME financing costs by 18%-22%, and stable order fulfillment rates above 95%.

Conclusion: Integrating economic theory with machine learning significantly enhances cost-efficiency, mitigates risks, and facilitates sustainable supply chain management.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Motivation: The study aims to understand and address how gradient variance and standard deviation evolve during training, impacting the stability and generalization of deep neural networks.

Method: The method involves a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization technique aligned with natural gradient scaling dynamics to prevent amplification and stabilize optimization processes.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN models demonstrate improved or maintained test accuracy, particularly under strong generalization conditions.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the significance of monitoring gradient dynamics and encourage bridging gaps between theoretical expectations and observed empirical behaviors for future optimization advancements.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

Motivation: To understand and improve the representational properties of neural operators, which are increasingly important in scientific computing.

Method: The paper introduces an extension of sparse autoencoders to lifted and infinite-dimensional spaces, analyzing their inference and training dynamics compared to other approaches.

Result: The lifted and operator-based modules show faster recovery, enhanced smooth concept recovery, and robust inference across resolutions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves interpretability and utility of neural operators by leveraging beneficial inductive biases.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiencies in Bayesian inference using exact graph node kernels, particularly for large-scale graphs.

Method: The authors employ Graph Random Features (GRFs), a stochastic estimator of graph node kernels, to replace exact kernel computations, reducing the computational complexity.

Result: The GRF-based approach reduces the time complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N^{3/2})$, achieving substantial speedups and memory savings for graphs with more than $10^6$ nodes.

Conclusion: Graph Random Features enable efficient Gaussian processes on large-scale graphs while maintaining competitive performance, making it feasible to perform tasks like Bayesian optimization on massive graphs using standard hardware.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently
introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian
processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs
with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive
performance.

Motivation: The authors aim to address emerging challenges in leveraging geo-distributed, multi-modal, and multi-task data processing across wireless devices, especially in fog/edge infrastructures.

Method: They propose HF-FMs, which align modular structures like modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts, adapters, and task heads with hierarchical fog/edge networks while incorporating device-to-device (D2D) communication for cooperative training.

Result: HF-FMs demonstrate unique capabilities for addressing heterogeneity in modalities and tasks across fog/edge nodes. Their effectiveness is prototyped in a wireless network setting, alongside released open-source code.

Conclusion: HF-FMs provide a promising direction for federated learning by addressing key edge and fog network challenges, with a modular design that supports diverse modalities and tasks.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR introduces a novel SNE algorithm addressing limitations in preserving data geometry and enhancing cluster structure visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNE algorithms often fail to preserve geometry and cluster structures in noisy, high-dimensional data.

Method: EmbedOR incorporates discrete graph curvature into a curvature-enhanced distance metric and extends tSNE consistency results for broader datasets.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show EmbedOR effectively preserves geometry and avoids fragmenting dense, continuous data regions.

Conclusion: EmbedOR improves visualization and enables annotations for deeper insights into data geometry, surpassing current SNE algorithms.

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

### [185] [Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)
*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the Online Testing Problem (OTP), an online learning problem focused on optimal test selection for subjects, revealing unique challenges caused by missing data during testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to optimize sequential testing policies for subjects while addressing the challenges posed by costly and correlated tests, as well as handling missing data that can lead to biased estimations.

Method: The authors propose algorithms, including an Explore-Then-Commit strategy with $	ilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret for OTP and an iterative-elimination approach achieving $	ilde{O}(\/sqrt{T})$ regret for a variant problem with missingness-independent rewards.

Result: The study establishes a theoretical minimax regret lower bound of $\/Omega(T^{2/3})$ for OTP, introduced algorithms that match this bound, and showed improved regret performance for a variant of the problem. Simulations validated the findings.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding of exploration-exploitation trade-offs under missing data scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing efficient online sequential testing strategies.

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning methods often fail in the real world, especially in high-stakes and socially sensitive contexts, limiting their benefits in areas like medical diagnosis.

Method: The paper highlights causal and statistical structures causing failures in image analysis and introduces two new problems: 'no fair lunch' and 'subgroup separability.'

Result: Current fair representation learning methods are inadequate in solving these newly identified problems.

Conclusion: The authors suggest potential paths forward to address these issues and improve the robustness and fairness of machine learning applications.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal

image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable estimator for range-partition entropy, applies it to neural networks, and demonstrates its efficiency in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make range-partition entropy, a concept from computational geometry, usable in deep learning for adaptable and efficient computations.

Method: Developed a differentiable approximation of range-partition entropy, designed EntropyNet to restructure data, and applied entropy regularization to Transformers.

Result: Achieved significant runtime speedups in geometry tasks and improved accuracy in sparse deep learning models, supported by theoretical bounds and extensive validation.

Conclusion: Entropy-bounded computation is both theoretically elegant and practically effective for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured representation.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SST-iTransformer to predict parking availability, surpassing existing models in accuracy using multi-source data and spatio-temporal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address urban parking challenges by improving prediction models, focusing on spatio-temporal dependencies and multi-source data utilization.

Method: The authors use SST-iTransformer with K-means clustering, dual-branch attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning to optimize parking prediction accuracy.

Result: Experiments with Chengdu data show SST-iTransformer achieves the lowest MSE and competitive MAE, proving more effective than other deep learning models.

Conclusion: Integrating historical data, ride-hailing features, and spatial dependencies significantly enhances parking prediction performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

### [190] [Mapping on a Budget: Optimizing Spatial Data Collection for ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03749)
*Livia Betti,Farooq Sanni,Gnouyaro Sogoyou,Togbe Agbagla,Cullen Molitor,Tamma Carleton,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses training data sparsity in Satellite Machine Learning (SatML) by introducing a method to optimize spatially limited data collection under constraints, significantly improving performance in simulated scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models using satellite imagery face challenges due to limited and spatially clustered labeled training data, which hampers large-scale applications like monitoring and policymaking.

Method: The paper proposes a problem formulation for optimizing spatial training data under heterogeneous data collection costs and budget constraints, and develops novel methods for addressing this problem.

Result: The methods demonstrate substantial performance improvements in simulations across three continents and four tasks, and identify scenarios where optimized sampling is most effective.

Conclusion: Optimized training data collection greatly enhances SatML applications. The formulation is adaptable across domains, with specific impact demonstrated for agricultural surveys in Togo.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

*Alvaro Almeida Gomez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method for extending real-valued functions on smooth manifolds, leveraging diffusion geometry, low-rank distance matrices, and online updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently approximate real-valued functions on smooth manifolds, addressing computational challenges in high-dimensional data, while improving accuracy and scalability.

Method: The approach utilizes diffusion geometry linked to the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a low-rank distance matrix reduction via SVD, and an online updating mechanism.

Result: The method outperformed traditional feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in accuracy and efficiency, particularly in applications like sparse CT reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is a powerful and scalable alternative for function approximation on manifolds, especially for high-dimensional data scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

### [192] [Learning an Adversarial World Model for Automated Curriculum Generation in MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that uses adversarial co-evolution to generate dynamic training environments for agents, enhancing their strategic depth and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for embodied intelligence are hindered by the constraints of finite complexity and pre-designed environments. The authors aim to address this limitation by developing adaptable training environments.

Method: They propose a system involving two agents: an "Attacker" agent generates challenging environments to exploit the "Defender" agents' weaknesses, while the Defender agents learn policies to overcome these challenges.

Result: The co-evolution process yields novel training scenarios, allowing defenders to develop complex behaviors, such as coordinated tactics, while attackers learn strategic formations.

Conclusion: Adversarial co-evolution creates scalable curricula for embodied intelligence, driving agents towards more robust and sophisticated strategies.

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

TL;DR: Examines the transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity for sparse-reward RL using low-rank structure in reward matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding properties of reward functions to improve sparse-reward RL efficiency.

Method: Introduces Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) framework linking matrix completion theory with RL through policy-dependent sampling analyses.

Result: PAMC boosts sample efficiency by factors of 1.6 to 2.1 across 100 domains, revealing low-rank structures in over half.

Conclusion: Structural reward learning proves impactful for sample-expensive applications like robotics and healthcare.

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

### [194] [Online time series prediction using feature adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03810)
*Xiannan Huang,Shuhan Qiu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADAPT-Z, a method for improving time series forecasting under distribution shift by focusing on adapting latent feature representations. The approach addresses delayed feedback using an adapter module that leverages historical and current gradient information, showing superior performance across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the need to address distribution shifts in time series forecasting, especially in online scenarios where data distributions evolve over time. Current approaches inadequately address latent factor shifts and the challenge of delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting.

Method: The authors propose ADAPT-Z, which utilizes an adapter module that updates latent feature representations influenced by distribution shifts. The method also incorporates historical gradient tracking to handle delayed feedback effectively.

Result: Experiments indicate that ADAPT-Z consistently outperforms baseline models and cutting-edge online learning methods across diverse datasets, validating its robustness and efficacy.

Conclusion: ADAPT-Z presents a novel approach to tackling distribution shifts in time series data, emphasizing latent factor adaptation and handling delayed feedback, proving to be more effective than existing methodologies.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

*Parth Ashokbhai Shiroya,Swarnagowri Shashidhar,Amod Ashtekar,Krishna Aindrila Kar,Rafaela Lomboy,Dalton Davis,Mohammed E. Eltayeb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a LiDAR-based machine learning framework to classify indoor surfaces based on their electromagnetic scattering properties, critical for reliable mmWave and sub-THz communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain connectivity in mmWave and sub-THz networks, which rely on reflections due to high signal sensitivity to blockage.

Method: A dataset of 78,000 points from 15 indoor surfaces was analyzed using features derived from LiDAR geometry and intensity. Models like Random Forest and XGBoost were trained for surface classification.

Result: Ensemble tree-based models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, demonstrated the best trade-off between classification accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework allows the creation of scatter-aware maps and digital twins, improving adaptive beam management and connectivity in next-gen networks.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

and high predictive power over imbalanced data. In this research, we study
neural network-based models on data related to traffic accidents. We begin
analyzing relative feature colinearity and unsupervised dimensionality
reduction through autoencoders, followed by a dense network. The features are
related to traffic accident data and the target is to classify accident
severity. Our experiments show cross-validated results of up to 92% accuracy
when classifying accident severity using the proposed deep neural network.

*Lucas Lopes Felipe,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Daniel Sadoc Menasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a game-theoretic reformulation of the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for community detection, focusing on its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the understanding and performance of community detection in networks using a game-theoretic approach.

Method: Reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, introducing stability criteria, and experimenting with robust partitions in community tracking scenarios.

Result: The study proves that the CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time and shows that robust partitions improve accuracy in ground-truth community tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of community detection, offering valuable insights and practical improvements.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

*Kimia Ehsani,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector to improve the spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication link prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance V2I communication by making accurate link quality predictions, leveraging sensor data from modern vehicles while addressing MLLMs' lack of spatial understanding.

Method: A lightweight BEV injection connector fuses spatial context from neighboring vehicles' sensing data with the ego vehicle's input. A co-simulation environment was also developed for multimodal learning using CARLA and MATLAB-generated datasets.

Result: Using the BEV framework, performance metrics improved significantly, achieving up to 13.9% macro-average accuracy gains across tasks, and up to 32.7% gains under challenging conditions like rain and nighttime.

Conclusion: The proposed BEV injection framework effectively enhances the prediction accuracy and robustness of MLLMs for V2I tasks, particularly in adverse environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep latent variable MFG model to address the challenge of inferring reward functions for heterogeneous agents in mean field games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods in mean field games struggle with agent heterogeneity and unknown objectives, which are common in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a deep latent variable model for MFGs and its associated IRL method, enabling reward inference without prior knowledge of tasks or modifications to the MFG model.

Result: Experiments on simulated scenarios and a real-world taxi-ride pricing problem show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art IRL methods in MFGs.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles context heterogeneity and demonstrates enhanced capability in reward inference for tasks across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

TL;DR: The paper combines Quantization-aware Training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) and proposes a novel metric to better select data augmentation (DA) strategies in order to improve low-bit deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored relationship between data augmentation and quantization-aware knowledge distillation, especially in low-precision models.

Method: A novel metric is proposed to evaluate data augmentations based on their ability to maximize Contextual Mutual Information and ensure class predictions align with ground truth labels. This metric enables automated selection of data augmentations with minimal training overhead.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art QAT and KD methods across various model architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: Careful selection of data augmentation strategies using the proposed metric enhances the effectiveness of QAT and KD, offering a robust way to improve low-bit model training.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MillGNN, a graph neural network (GNN) methodology, improves multi-variate time series forecasting by capturing hierarchical lead-lag dependencies across multiple grouping scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting methods struggle to consider hierarchical lead-lag effects within complex systems, leading to inefficiencies in capturing significant dependencies for multi-variate time series (MTS) prediction.

Method: MillGNN employs two modules: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning module using real-time inputs and dynamic decay features to model dependencies per scale, and (2) a hierarchical lead-lag message passing module for propagating lead-lag effects comprehensively across scales.

Result: MillGNN outperformed 16 state-of-the-art methods in experimental trials on 11 datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: MillGNN addresses the gap in capturing hierarchical lead-lag dependencies, achieving superior forecasting accuracy across diverse datasets and proving its efficiency in handling intricate MTS dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: CHD is a leading cause of death and a significant healthcare burden, requiring improved diagnostic methods.

Method: An MLP neural network was designed and trained using urinary peptide biomarkers, genetic algorithms for feature selection, SMOTE for balance, and stratified validation strategies.

Result: The model achieved high precision (95.67%), sensitivity, specificity, an AUC of 0.9748, and robust metrics like MCC and Cohen's kappa.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates strong potential as a reliable and non-invasive diagnostic tool for CHD detection.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

Motivation: Existing protein representation learning methods struggle to capture hierarchical structural organization inherent in protein structures.

Method: Proposed a framework, Topotein, comprising Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) for hierarchical protein representation and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet) for SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical levels.

Result: Topotein showed superior performance on four protein learning tasks, particularly excelling in fold classification, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical topological features are essential for enhanced protein analysis and understanding structure-function relationships.

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

Conclusion: Embedding a verified and reliable AI-based fault detection system in satellites can significantly enhance performance under uncertainty and reduce resource needs for addressing failures.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to align ML models with clinical knowledge for more meaningful predictions without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misalignment between machine learning models and clinical experiential learning in healthcare.

Method: In a prostate cancer case study, researchers integrated clinical knowledge via constraints into ML models, assessed performance across varied degrees of underspecification, and incorporated feedback-driven alignment.

Result: Incorporating clinical constraints improves alignment with practitioner interpretation while preserving model efficacy.

Conclusion: ML models can be adjusted to align better with clinical insights, improving interpretability and maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FedQuad, a method to tackle data heterogeneity in Federated Learning (FL) by optimizing intra-class and inter-class variance, achieving superior performance on CIFAR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization challenges of FL models caused by data heterogeneity, limited datasets, and class imbalance across clients.

Method: FedQuad minimizes intra-class variance and maximizes inter-class variance across clients using metric learning strategies to improve global model aggregation and disentangle client data in the feature space.

Result: FedQuad demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, validating its ability to handle various data distributions and high numbers of clients.

Conclusion: FedQuad effectively mitigates the negative impacts of heterogeneous data by leveraging metric learning for enhanced representational learning in federated settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

*Amirmohammad Farzaneh,Matteo Zecchin,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework (SP-CCI) is introduced to improve counterfactual prediction intervals using synthetic data, reducing conservativeness without sacrificing coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for constructing counterfactual prediction intervals are often overly conservative, especially when counterfactual samples are scarce due to treatment imbalance.

Method: The method utilizes synthetic counterfactual labels generated by pre-trained models, incorporates risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS), and applies a debiasing step using prediction-powered inference (PPI) during calibration.

Result: SP-CCI consistently achieves tighter prediction intervals compared to standard methods, both in theory and empirical experiments across various datasets.

Conclusion: SP-CCI offers a reliable and effective approach to constructing narrower prediction intervals with maintained coverage guarantees, advancing counterfactual inference techniques.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

### [209] [Who Pays for Fairness? Rethinking Recourse under Social Burden](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04128)
*Ainhize Barrainkua,Giovanni De Toni,Jose Antonio Lozano,Novi Quadrianto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses fairness in algorithmic recourse and proposes a novel framework and algorithm (MISOB) to address social burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address emerging legislative and ethical concerns about fairness in algorithmic recourse and classification.

Method: A theoretical analysis of recourse fairness, introduction of the 'social burden' framework, and development of the MISOB algorithm.

Result: Empirical findings indicate that MISOB effectively lowers social burden for all groups without reducing classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of integrating fairness into algorithmic recourse and demonstrates the practical effectiveness of their approach.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

*Benoît Ronval,Pierre Dupont,Siegfried Nijssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents TAGAL, a method leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic tabular data, achieving competitive performance without requiring additional LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving machine learning tasks, notably classification, through enhanced synthetic data generation using LLMs to overcome limitations in real data availability.

Method: TAGAL uses an agentic workflow with iterative feedback to generate synthetic tabular data using LLMs, incorporating external knowledge without requiring additional training of the LLMs.

Result: TAGAL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods that require LLM training and outperforms other training-free approaches in terms of both utility for downstream ML models and data similarity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of TAGAL, emphasizing the promise of agentic workflows and the untapped potential of LLM-driven synthetic data generation methods.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

### [211] [Attention as an Adaptive Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154)
*Peter Racioppo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel attention mechanism, Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), uses a linear stochastic differential equation to compute robust attention weights rather than comparing queries and keys directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance attention mechanisms by incorporating model-based dynamics for improved robustness and efficiency in handling uncertainties in input sequences.

Method: The AFA models input sequences as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation, using linear dynamics and pairwise uncertainties propagated via closed-form solutions to compute attention weights.

Result: Attention weights are derived as a maximum-likelihood solution, achieving robust reweighting of the propagated pairwise precisions.

Conclusion: AFA generalizes standard attention mechanisms and recovers dot-product attention under specific constraints, providing an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative attention model.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

TL;DR: The paper explores the effectiveness of self-supervised speech models on bioacoustic detection and classification tasks, showing their competitive performance and potential in bioacoustics research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the unexplored effectiveness of self-supervised speech models on non-speech data, particularly focusing on bioacoustic sounds.

Method: The authors analyzed speech models like HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS using linear probing on time-averaged and time-wise latent representations, while also studying influences of frequency range and noise.

Result: The findings reveal that such models generate rich representations of animal sounds that are competitive with fine-tuned, bioacoustic-specific pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Self-supervised speech learning offers an efficient framework for bioacoustic research, demonstrating noise-robust performance and broad application potential.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

*Nicolas Johansson,Tobias Olsson,Daniel Nilsson,Johan Östman,Fazeleh Hoseini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses membership inference attacks (MIAs) in time series forecasting, introducing two new approaches and evaluating their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the largely unexplored impact of MIAs on time-series forecasting and address the privacy risks associated with these models.

Method: Introduced two new methods: an adaptation of multivariate LiRA for time-series forecasting, and a novel Deep Time Series (DTS) attack, benchmarked against adaptations of other leading attacks on datasets and forecasting architectures.

Result: Forecasting models are shown to be vulnerable to MIAs, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods perform strongly and establish new baselines for privacy risk in this field.

Conclusion: Time-series forecasting models pose significant privacy risks, exacerbated by longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, necessitating further vigilance and research in mitigating MIAs in this domain.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses the phenomenon of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), focusing on Dirichlet energy and presenting new proofs and experimental insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze and address the problem of over-smoothing in GNNs by studying Dirichlet energy and its implications.

Method: They use theoretical analysis of Dirichlet energy involving Leaky-ReLU and extend these findings to spectral polynomial filters, accompanied by experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification.

Result: Demonstrated that Dirichlet energy decreases exponentially with depth under certain conditions; also provided insights from experiments on scenarios where Dirichlet energy increases.

Conclusion: The findings suggest practical techniques to mitigate over-smoothing by modifying edge properties and weight behaviors in GNNs.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Set Block Decoding (SBD), a method that accelerates language model inference by combining next token prediction and masked token prediction, resulting in faster generation without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome high computational and memory costs incurred during the decoding stage of autoregressive next token prediction models, which hinder their practical deployment.

Method: The proposed SBD method integrates next token prediction and masked token prediction, enabling the model to sample multiple future tokens in parallel. This uses solvers from discrete diffusion literature and can be implemented by fine-tuning existing models without requiring architectural changes.

Result: By fine-tuning models like Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, SBD achieves a 3-5x reduction in forward passes while maintaining the same performance as conventional next token prediction training.

Conclusion: SBD provides a practical solution for accelerating generation in language models, significantly enhancing efficiency without compromising accuracy or compatibility.

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

*Hao-Nan Shi,Ting-Ji Huang,Lu Han,De-Chuan Zhan,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZooCast intelligently integrates Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) into a dynamic 'model zoo' to optimize zero-shot forecasting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to overcome the limitations of individual TSFMs which excel on specific temporal patterns but lack universal efficacy.

Method: ZooCast employs a 'One-Embedding-Fits-All' approach to construct a unified space where models are efficiently matched for different forecasting tasks.

Result: Experiments validate ZooCast's superior performance on the GIFT-Eval benchmark, ensuring efficiency comparable to individual TSFMs.

Conclusion: ZooCast provides a scalable framework that adapts seamlessly to new TSFM additions, enhancing forecasting accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces supervised metrics—precision and recall—to evaluate the relationship phase in Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithms, addressing the issue of hidden cluster structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is used to visualize high-dimensional data and identify cluster structures. However, expected cluster structures sometimes don't appear in projections, and existing DR metrics don't fully explain this absence.

Method: The paper divides the DR process into two phases: the relationship phase (similarity modeling) and the mapping phase (data projection). It introduces two supervised metrics, precision and recall, to evaluate how well similarity relationships align with cluster structures derived from labels.

Result: The approach was applied to t-SNE and UMAP, demonstrating its utility in hyperparameter tuning, identifying projection artifacts, and verifying the capture of expected structures through multiple usage scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics enhance the reliability and efficiency of the DR process by explaining why certain cluster structures might be missing and guiding users in their analysis.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper defines long-range dependency mathematically to evaluate and compare the capability of state-space models (SSM) and transformers in handling long-range dependencies, proposing improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of long-range dependency in sequence models highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and theoretical investigation.

Method: The authors define long-range dependency rigorously using derivative-based measures and assess SSMs and transformers. They devise a new formulation for hidden state updates in SSM.

Result: SSMs exhibit exponential decay in long-range dependency, while transformers are more flexible but demand more training resources. A new stable hidden state update formulation for SSM is introduced.

Conclusion: Transformers theoretically have an edge in modeling long-range dependencies, yet SSM's computational efficiency makes them attractive. A hybrid improvement is pursued to balance flexibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

*Qifeng Tan,Shusen Yang,Xuebin Ren,Yikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework to optimize layer-wise noise allocation in differentially private deep learning, improving privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a rigorous connection between layer-wise noise allocation in deep learning and privacy-utility tradeoffs, as existing methods often rely on heuristic strategies.

Method: A unified analytical framework is proposed to connect noise injection strategies with optimization objectives, leading to a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-Consistent noise allocation scheme.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in privacy-utility tradeoffs, as demonstrated by extensive experiments in centralized and federated learning settings.

Conclusion: The framework improves signal preservation and privacy budget efficiency, offering insights into previous methods and guiding the design of adaptive noise injection schemes.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HF research faces challenges due to privacy constraints and restricted data sharing. The study aims to leverage synthetic data as a solution to enhance collaboration and preserve confidentiality.

Method: Five deep learning models were tested for generating synthetic HF datasets: TVAE, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, TabDDPM, and normalizing flow. Evaluation involved statistical metrics, ML-based survival prediction, and privacy assessments.

Result: SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM exhibited high fidelity to real datasets, while TVAE and SurvivalGAN performed strongly in survival predictions. Privacy protections were validated against re-identification risks.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods can generate synthetic HF datasets that are both privacy-preserving and research-ready, enabling broader data-sharing and supporting predictive modeling in HF studies.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

*Idan Shenfeld,Jyothish Pari,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) retains prior model capabilities better than supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while performing similarly on new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the discrepancy in prior knowledge retention between RL and SFT during fine-tuning of models on new tasks.

Method: The study compares RL and SFT approaches, analyzing the KL-divergence between model distributions when fine-tuned, and validating findings empirically and theoretically.

Result: RL minimizes KL-divergence changes, preserving prior knowledge better compared to SFT, which can lead to distributions far from the original model.

Conclusion: RL's Razor principle has been introduced, suggesting RL prefers solutions closest in KL-divergence to the original model while achieving task success.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

### [222] [An Interactive Framework for Finding the Optimal Trade-off in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04290)
*Yaohong Yang,Aki Rehn,Sammie Katt,Antti Honkela,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient method for finding the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off in differential privacy by modeling the Pareto front directly and using a better approach for preference elicitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to select an optimal balance between privacy guarantees and model performance in differential privacy introduces a critical multi-objective optimization problem.

Method: The authors derive the theoretical trade-off shape, directly model the Pareto front, and enhance preference learning by replacing pairwise comparisons with user interactions involving hypothetical trade-off curves.

Result: Experiments in differentially private logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six datasets demonstrate the method's ability to converge to the optimal trade-offs with reduced computational cost and fewer user interactions compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages problem structure and improves preference learning, facilitating more efficient discovery of privacy-accuracy trade-offs in differential privacy.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

*Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes AT-UCB, an algorithm that improves decision-making in causal multi-armed bandits by efficiently leveraging causal abstraction to reduce regret and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision-making problems often involve different levels of abstraction, but there lacks a systematic methodology to exploit the shared information between these abstraction levels for causal multi-armed bandit problems.

Method: The authors present AT-UCB, which uses causal abstraction theory for initial exploration in a cheaper, coarse-grained CMAB instance. It then refines this to focus on a subset of optimal actions in the main CMAB using the traditional UCB algorithm.

Result: AT-UCB reduces cumulative regret significantly compared to the classical UCB algorithm, shown both theoretically with a novel regret bound and empirically using applications like epidemiological simulators.

Conclusion: The proposed AT-UCB algorithm demonstrates efficiency in exploiting information across abstraction levels, offering a more cost-effective and less regretful alternative for CMAB-based decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

*Haley Dozier,Althea Henslee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses climate resilience in U.S. Army installations by proposing a data-driven model to analyze energy behavior, aiming to understand disruptions and benchmark resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect U.S. Army installations from climate risks and vulnerabilities in energy systems and to sustain critical missions.

Method: Develop a behavioral model analyzing multimodal energy usage data of non-residential buildings using open-access data for validation.

Result: Generated behavior profiles to assess the impact of disruptions and benchmark resilience measures.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology supports the baseline understanding of energy vulnerabilities and future resilience planning for Army installations.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

### [225] [When three experiments are better than two: Avoiding intractable correlated aleatoric uncertainty by leveraging a novel bias--variance tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04363)
*Paul Scherer,Andreas Kirsch,Jake P. Taylor-King*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel active learning strategies leveraging relationships between bias and uncertainty to enhance performance in noisy batched experimental scenarios, outperforming canonical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world experiments have inherent uncertainties, often magnified in batched settings, necessitating more robust modeling strategies to optimize learning.

Method: The paper combines the bias-variance tradeoff concept and develops active learning methods that tackle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while employing a novel cobias-covariance relationship and eigendecomposition.

Result: The proposed approach, particularly the difference-based method utilizing cobias-covariance in batched scenarios, exceeds the performance of traditional tools like BALD and Least Confidence.

Conclusion: By integrating advanced statistical relationships, the method enhances active learning performance in experimental scenarios with uncertainty and batching.

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Jie Ye,Xian-He Sun,Anthony Kougkas,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PagedEviction, a KV cache pruning strategy improving memory efficiency during large sequence inference in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching accelerates LLM inference but becomes a memory bottleneck as sequence length grows, necessitating optimized caching strategies.

Method: The proposed PagedEviction uses a fine-grained, block-wise eviction algorithm fit for paged memory layouts without modifying CUDA attention kernels.

Result: Evaluation on models like Llama-3.x demonstrates that PagedEviction reduces memory usage while achieving better accuracy than baseline methods for long-context tasks.

Conclusion: PagedEviction enhances LLM memory efficiency during inference, offering a scalable and accurate method for handling long sequence tasks.

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

### [227] [Transition Models: Rethinking the Generative Learning Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04394)
*Zidong Wang,Yiyuan Zhang,Xiaoyu Yue,Xiangyu Yue,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the fidelity-efficiency trade-off in generative modeling by introducing Transition Models (TiM), which enable arbitrary-step transitions to enhance quality across all sampling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models face a dilemma: diffusion models have high fidelity but are computationally expensive, while few-step models are limited by quality constraints.

Method: The paper proposes an exact continuous-time dynamics equation that governs state transitions over finite time intervals, implemented as Transition Models (TiM).

Result: TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 865M parameters, surpassing models with much higher parameter counts in both quality and efficiency. Its quality improves monotonically with increased steps and excels at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Conclusion: TiM resolves the existing fidelity-efficiency trade-off in generative modeling, offering scalable and high-quality output across a wide range of steps and resolutions.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

*Yuan Yin,Shashanka Venkataramanan,Tuan-Hung Vu,Andrei Bursuc,Matthieu Cord*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPA introduces a feature-aware projection approach to enhance LoRA by preserving information in a reduced hidden space, leading to significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's data-agnostic, randomly initialized down-projection limits adaptation performance, as it does not preserve useful information during fine-tuning.

Method: IPA uses a feature-aware framework with algorithms approximating top principal components for efficient projector pretraining, ensuring better information preservation during fine-tuning.

Result: IPA outperforms LoRA and DoRA, showing a 1.5-point improvement in commonsense reasoning and a 2.3-point increase on VTAB-1k, while using fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Feature-aware projections like IPA enhance parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods by addressing information loss in random initializations, achieving better performance with reduced resources.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

*Wenrui Li,Qinghao Zhang,Xiaowo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel unsupervised framework, HCL, that enables the discovery of interpretable causal heterogeneity from mixed-type observational data without requiring prior knowledge, and demonstrates its effectiveness in clustering and structure learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in understanding causal heterogeneity in domains like biology and medicine due to limitations in current causality-aware methods, which struggle with confounding, heterogeneity, and observational constraints.

Method: The authors introduce HCL, an unsupervised framework that jointly infers latent clusters and their causal structures using a bi-directional iterative strategy. It relaxes homogeneity and sufficiency assumptions, encoding structural heterogeneity and confounding into the representation.

Result: HCL identifies heterogeneous causal structures under mild identifiability conditions, achieves superior performance in clustering and structure learning compared to existing methods, and uncovers biologically meaningful mechanisms in single-cell perturbation data.

Conclusion: The framework enhances scientific discovery by uncovering interpretable and mechanism-level causal heterogeneity, showing promise for applications in domains like biology and medicine.

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

*Xingtai Lv,Yuxin Zuo,Youbang Sun,Hongyi Liu,Yuntian Wei,Zhekai Chen,Lixuan He,Xuekai Zhu,Kaiyan Zhang,Bingning Wang,Ning Ding,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in post-training language models into a single framework via a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, proposing a new algorithm called Hybrid Post-Training (HPT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to integrate two major sources of training data for post-training language models—online rollouts and offline demonstrations—into a cohesive framework, rather than treating them as separate paradigms.

Method: The method involves deriving a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator with four modular components and using this to propose the HPT algorithm, which selects different training signals dynamically to optimize learning.

Result: Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution test suites, the proposed HPT algorithm consistently outperforms robust baseline methods in terms of model performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework and the Hybrid Post-Training algorithm demonstrate that combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning approaches yields better results in post-training tasks for language models, improving both reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

*Pradeep Singh,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reframes Echo State Networks as state-space models, connecting them to both classical identification and modern kernelized methods, and provides theoretical and practical advancements for stability, linearization, and learning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to move beyond heuristic-driven design of Echo State Networks by providing a principled systems-theoretic framework to better understand and optimize their dynamics and performance.

Method: The authors connect Echo State Networks to state-space models, derive stability conditions, develop mappings for linear approximations and feature expansions, and enhance training using Kalman filters and spectral shaping with contraction constraints.

Result: The paper provides conditions for stability, interpretable approximations of Echo State Network dynamics, frequency-domain insights, and improved learning strategies using Kalman filtering and EM for hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: This work elevates the theoretical understanding and practical applicability of Echo State Networks by framing them within a rigorous state-space model perspective, offering both analytical insights and enhanced training mechanisms.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The understanding of why recent advancements in tabular DL methods succeed has been insufficient, necessitating deeper insight into their mechanisms.

Method: The authors analyze the mechanisms of high-performing tabular DL methods, focusing on their implicit handling of data uncertainty, and propose improved numerical feature embeddings based on these insights.

Result: The analysis provides a unified understanding of tabular DL advancements and results in the creation of more effective numerical feature embeddings.

Conclusion: This work advances foundational knowledge in tabular DL, offers practical improvements, and identifies areas for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) as vector embeddings based on shifts in their internal activations, aiding model organization and selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating and understanding finetuned LLMs is difficult due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.

Method: Delta Activations measure shifts in internal activations relative to a base model, creating vector embeddings that are robust across finetuning, additive across mixed datasets, and applicable to tasks via few-shot finetuning.

Result: Delta Activations reveal clustering by domain and task, exhibit robustness and additive properties, can embed tasks, and support model selection and merging.

Conclusion: Delta Activations can improve reuse and organization of publicly available finetuned LLMs, offering a structured approach to understanding and navigating their landscape.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

*Cyrus Cousins,Vijay Keswani,Vincent Conitzer,Hoda Heidari,Jana Schaich Borg,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap between AI models used for preference alignment and the true cognitive processes underlying human decision-making by proposing a structured approach to model human decision behavior accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI preference elicitation methods fail to align with human cognitive processes, potentially limiting generalizability and fidelity in decision-making tasks.

Method: The authors propose an axiomatic modeling approach based on structured processing and aggregation in pairwise comparisons, inspired by cognitive decision-making literature.

Result: The approach was tested in a kidney allocation task, demonstrating that the proposed models were either accurate or more accurate than prior models while remaining interpretable.

Conclusion: Structured, cognitively-informed modeling improves fidelity in understanding and replicating human decision processes, with applicability to broader decision-making contexts.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a realistic and structured benchmark for time series forecasting and anomaly detection in microservice systems.

Method: Introduces ChronoGraph, which models services as nodes with performance metrics and their dependencies as directed edges, with datasets annotated for forecasting and anomaly assessment.

Result: Baseline results from various forecasting models and anomaly detection methods highlight the dataset's utility.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph uniquely combines multivariate data, dependency graphs, and real incident labels, making it a valuable tool for studying structure-aware forecasting and robustness in disruptions.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

*Sara Makenali,Babak Rokh,Ali Azarpeyvand*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by combining pruning and Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT) quantization for effective model compression while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges posed by DNN deployment on resource-limited devices due to computational and memory demands, leveraging complementary benefits of pruning and quantization for effective compression is explored.

Method: Two approaches to integrate similarity-based filter pruning with APoT quantization are proposed: 1) Simultaneously applying pruning and quantization during training; 2) Sequentially performing pruning first, followed by low-bit quantization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effective compression and minimal accuracy loss, making the methods suitable for devices with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated approaches provide efficient model compression, balancing computational and memory efficiency without compromising sufficient accuracy.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide
range of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
devices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,
which result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this
issue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,
commonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance
processing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even
greater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization
to harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily
due to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly
optimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that
integrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)
quantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model
accuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied
simultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed
first to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the
pruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal
accuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with
limited computational resources.

### [237] [When Lifetimes Liberate: A Type System for Arenas with Higher-Order Reachability Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04253)
*Siyuan He,Songlin Jia,Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancements to resource management in higher-order functional languages by combining strengths of region-based systems, ownership types (like Rust), and reachability types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static resource management in functional languages faces challenges in balancing control, expressiveness, and flexibility. Current approaches like region-based systems, ownership types, and reachability types each have gaps, prompting the need for a unified solution.

Method: The authors introduce two extensions—A<: and {A}<:—to reachability types with novel features: a two-dimensional store model for tracking shared resources and mechanisms for lexical lifetime control.

Result: The proposed extensions enable flexible resource grouping into arenas or individual management with non-lexical lifetimes, while maintaining static safety guarantees and type consistency in higher-order functional languages.

Conclusion: This research provides a unified system combining the strengths of existing paradigms, offering static safety guarantees with flexible sharing and lifetime control in higher-order languages.

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

### [238] [Self-Organizing Aerial Swarm Robotics for Resilient Load Transportation : A Table-Mechanics-Inspired Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03563)
*Quan Quan,Jiwen Xu,Runxiao Liu,Yi Ding,Jiaxing Che,Kai-Yuan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decentralized, physics-inspired approach for cooperative aerial transportation using flying robot swarms, achieving high robustness, scalability, and success rates without explicit communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to multi-robot aerial transportation face challenges with scalability, communication requirements, and robustness in dynamic conditions. This paper aims to address these shortcomings to enhance applications in logistics and disaster response.

Method: The authors developed a decentralized dissipative force model inspired by table leg load distribution mechanics. This enables adaptive load allocation and autonomous formation stabilization among robots, based solely on local neighbor interactions and payload feedback.

Result: Simulations show significantly reduced tracking errors compared to existing methods under various challenging conditions. Real-world experiments with six robots attained a 94% success rate despite payload variations, cable uncertainties, and dynamic failures, even in outdoor winds.

Conclusion: This physics-inspired framework demonstrates a scalable, robust solution for cooperative aerial transport in constrained environments, advancing the integration of swarm intelligence with mechanical principles.

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a decision-making framework for two-robot object transport, leveraging neural networks to identify feasible grasp configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling two robots to cooperatively transport objects in constrained environments using feasible grasp configurations.

Method: The framework uses a Conditional Embedding (CE) model with two neural networks that process grasp configuration data into an embedding space, using supervised learning and negative sampling. Training data includes diverse environment maps and object shapes.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the model's reliability in identifying feasible grasp configurations across varied environments and objects. Experiments on physical robots further validate the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is generalizable and practical, effectively enabling cooperative robotic object transport in constrained settings.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Virtuoso, a conditional latent diffusion model aimed at goal-conditioned trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for computationally efficient, highly precise, and diverse trajectory generation for autonomous vehicle systems.

Method: A conditional latent diffusion model using a novel two-stage normalization pipeline and MLP denoiser, conditioned on scene context through a Transformer-based StateEncoder.

Result: Efficient Virtuoso achieves a minADE of 0.25 on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and provides insights on goal representation for improved tactical execution.

Conclusion: A richer, multi-step sparse route representation is essential for achieving nuanced human-like driving behavior compared to a single endpoint goal.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Result: The method achieves real-time updates, accounting for orientation, depth, and wave fluctuations, and is tested successfully on a custom AUV for SAUVC 2025.

Conclusion: This approach enhances simulation fidelity and scalability for underwater robotics without requiring precomputed hydrodynamic models.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested

*Guanglu Jia,Ceng Zhang,Gregory S. Chirikjian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called INGRID for designing parallel robotic mechanisms using AI and advanced theories, addressing limitations imposed by traditional robotic hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the limitations of robotic intelligence tied to traditional serial mechanisms by introducing automated design capabilities for parallel robotic structures.

Method: The framework integrates reciprocal screw theory, kinematic synthesis methods, and four tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design.

Result: INGRID is capable of generating unique parallel robotic mechanisms with customizable mobility and demonstrates this capability through case studies.

Conclusion: This framework decouples robotic intelligence from hardware constraints, enabling broader access to mechanism design and laying groundwork for AI-powered robotic hardware development.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

Result: The system enables realistic simulation of cloud-assisted aerial robots under variable network conditions for understanding challenges in cloud robotics.

Conclusion: The developed framework successfully addresses practical issues in cloud-robot integration by enabling seamless testing under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Motivation: The main motivation is to tackle the challenges of quadruped-based mobile manipulation, such as skill diversity, extended task duration, and partial observability, by using a comprehensive pick-and-place task.

Method: The authors proposed a visuo-motor policy trained entirely in simulation to perform a sequence of tasks, leveraging techniques for sim-to-real transfer and efficient training.

Result: The approach achieved nearly 80% success in real-world experiments, demonstrated robust behaviors like re-grasping and task chaining, and showed deployment possibilities across varied environments.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a capable visuo-motor policy for quadruped-based mobile manipulation, demonstrating effective training techniques and providing insights into sim-to-real transfer for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and
effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment

*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a dual-arm visuotactile framework for manipulating crumpled and suspended garments, utilizing dense visual correspondence and tactile-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clothing manipulation is challenging due to complex configurations, material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion, and prior systems overly simplify these tasks.

Method: The system uses confidence-aware dense visual correspondence trained on a simulated dataset and tactile-supervised grasp affordance employing high-resolution tactile feedback.

Result: The framework successfully adapts tasks such as folding and hanging garments, using a reusable intermediate representation to generalize across tasks.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable and generalizable solution for garment manipulation and can integrate with broader planning systems, including human demonstration-derived targets.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

*Branimir Ćaran,Vladimir Milić,Marko Švaco,Bojan Jerbić*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on creating a sensor fusion-based pose estimator for a wall-climbing mobile robot, utilizing EKF and UKF with multimodal data to address challenges posed by complex building environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise pose estimation is essential for wall-climbing robots used in construction tasks that involve navigating complex environments where traditional sensors and GPS are unreliable.

Method: Fusion of odometry, visual odometry, IMU data using EKF and UKF, along with calibration of systematic parameters via nonlinear optimization techniques and stochastic methods like Genetic algorithm and Particle Swarm.

Result: Experimental validation of calibration techniques and pose estimator effectiveness on a mobile wall-climbing robot in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed pose estimation approach effectively addresses environmental challenges and provides reliable localization for wall-climbing robots in construction settings.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

Motivation: Traditional perception-planning pipelines for robotics struggle with open-ended tasks, while existing Vision-Language-Action models lack mechanisms for handling action failures.

Method: The paper introduces FPC-VLA, combining a Vision-Language-Action model with a supervisor mechanism for failure prediction and corrective strategies, leveraging a similarity-guided fusion module and efficient training without manual labeling.

Result: FPC-VLA outperformed state-of-the-art robotic models in simulation and real-world tests, showing strong generalization and higher task success rates with minimal execution delays.

Conclusion: FPC-VLA provides a significant step toward more flexible and reliable autonomous systems for robotic manipulation, excelling in diverse, long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

*Hongyin Zhang,Shiyuan Zhang,Junxi Jin,Qixin Zeng,Yifan Qiao,Hongchao Lu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM), an offline RL fine-tuning algorithm for Vision-Language-Action models to address limitations in action accuracy for complex robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the action accuracy of Vision-Language-Action models for complex robotic tasks by combining imitation learning with offline RL to address data quality distribution issues.

Method: Developed ARFM, an offline RL fine-tuning algorithm incorporating an adaptively adjusted scaling factor to balance RL advantage preservation with flow loss gradient variance control.

Result: ARFM demonstrated superior generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: ARFM provides a stable and efficient approach to enhance Vision-Language-Action models, combining RL and imitation learning effectively to achieve better performance in complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning framework (DRLR) for robotics tasks using demonstrations, validated in simulation and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance robotic learning efficiency and robustness in deep reinforcement learning tasks by incorporating demonstration-based methods and addressing bootstrapping errors.

Method: The DRLR framework builds on the Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL) algorithm, modifies the action selection to calibrate Q-values, and employs the SAC policy instead of TD3 to avoid sub-optimal convergence.

Result: The method was validated through simulations of tasks like bucket loading and open drawer, showing robustness across different dimensions and demonstration qualities. Real-world deployment on a wheel loader confirmed successful sim2real transfer.

Conclusion: The DRLR framework improves exploration efficiency, mitigates bootstrapping errors, and enables successful real-world deployment in industrial robotics tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate

### [252] [Keypoint-based Diffusion for Robotic Motion Planning on the NICOL Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04076)
*Lennart Clasmeier,Jan-Gerrit Habekost,Connor Gäde,Philipp Allgeuer,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-based diffusion action model for robotic motion planning, reducing runtime significantly and achieving high success rates compared to numerical planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical planning methods for robotic motion planning often require significant runtime, motivating the need for faster, efficient alternatives.

Method: The model leverages deep learning to predict keypoint-based joint sequences using point cloud embeddings, training on datasets generated by numerical planners. Refinements to address dataset biases enhanced performance.

Result: The model achieves up to 90% success rates for collision-free solutions on the test set, outperforming numerical planners by an order of magnitude in runtime.

Conclusion: Deep learning presents a viable solution for robotic motion planning, providing significant runtime improvements while maintaining high success rates.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

### [253] [Object-Reconstruction-Aware Whole-body Control of Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04094)
*Fatih Dursun,Bruno Vilhena Adorno,Simon Watson,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computationally efficient object reconstruction strategy using focus points in unknown regions, compared to a sampling-based approach, proving faster results with similar coverage and entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiency in object reconstruction tasks requires identifying paths that explore unknown regions, but current methods are computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed method uses focus points in unknown regions to guide a robot's camera view, integrated into whole-body control of mobile manipulators without extra path planners.

Result: Simulation on 114 objects and real-world tests demonstrate no significant difference in coverage or entropy but show nine times faster results compared to traditional sampling-based methods.

Conclusion: This efficient approach reduces computational costs while maintaining reconstruction performance, making it a promising alternative to existing techniques.

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

### [254] [Lightweight Kinematic and Static Modeling of Cable-Driven Continuum Robots via Actuation-Space Energy Formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04119)
*Ke Wu,Yuhao Wang,Kevin Henry,Cesare Stefanini,Gang Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for cable-driven continuum robots to improve motion planning and control accuracy while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuum robots with deformable structures are ideal for unstructured environments but pose challenges for accurate and efficient modeling in motion planning and control.

Method: The proposed LASEM framework models actuation potential energy in actuation space, leveraging beam and rod theories via Hamilton's principle without explicit cable-backbone contact modeling.

Result: LASEM demonstrates accuracy in numerical simulations and introduces an iterative scheme for inverse kinematics while generalizing to non-uniform geometries and distributed loading.

Conclusion: LASEM offers a computationally efficient and accurate framework for motion modeling in continuum robots, making it practical for real-time applications.

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

### [255] [OVGrasp: Open-Vocabulary Grasping Assistance via Multimodal Intent Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04324)
*Chen Hu,Shan Luo,Letizia Gionfrida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OVGrasp is a wearable soft exoskeleton framework that leverages multimodal inputs—including open-vocabulary vision, language, and voice commands—for robust assistance in grasping tasks in unstructured environments. It enables zero-shot object recognition and demonstrates high performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of restoring autonomous grasping ability in individuals with motor impairments, particularly in complex environments where objects and intentions are unpredictable.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical control framework named OVGrasp, combining RGB-D vision, vision-language models, voice commands, and multimodal decision-making for inferring user intent in grasping tasks. The system enables zero-shot object detection without retraining and operates on a wearable egocentric-view soft exoskeleton.

Result: OVGrasp was evaluated systematically across 15 objects and three grasp types with ten participants, achieving a grasping ability score of 87.00%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. It also showed improved alignment with natural hand motions.

Conclusion: OVGrasp demonstrates robust multimodal interaction and generalization in open environments, offering a promising solution for motor impairment assistance by combining cutting-edge AI techniques with wearable exoskeleton technology.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton for collecting human manipulation data easily transferable to robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in collecting high-quality data for dexterous robotic manipulation in natural environments.

Method: Developed DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton that mirrors human hand movements to a robot hand, allowing for sensory data collection with direct feedback.

Result: DEXOP was tested on various dexterous tasks, showing improved speed, accuracy, and scalability of demonstration data collection while enhancing robot task performance.

Conclusion: DEXOP successfully provides a more efficient and natural way to collect high-quality sensory data, helping advance robotic dexterity.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EMMA framework enables scalable mobile manipulation training using human data instead of expensive robot teleoperation, achieving comparable task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and difficulty of mobile robot teleoperation hinder scalable mobile manipulation training.

Method: EMMA co-trains policies using human full-body motion data combined with static robot data, bypassing the need for mobile robot teleoperation.

Result: EMMA achieves comparable task success to teleoperator-trained baselines, generalizes well to new environments, and scales effectively with increased human data hours.

Conclusion: EMMA offers a promising solution to scalable robotic learning, leveraging human data to reduce reliance on costly mobile robot teleoperation.

Abstract: Scaling mobile manipulation imitation learning is bottlenecked by expensive
mobile robot teleoperation. We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA),
an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile
manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To
accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot
data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates
comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data
(Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task
success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations
and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the
hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in
real-world environments. Details of this project can be found at

TL;DR: This research investigates datasets used in requirements engineering (RE) for mobile apps, finding heavy reliance on Google Play and Apple App Store and a focus on requirements elicitation and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sources and activities investigated in RE research for mobile apps, aiming for more generalizable insights.

Method: The researchers conducted a systematic mapping study based on guidelines from Kitchenham et al., analyzing 43 selected papers.

Result: Google Play and Apple App Store datasets dominate RE research for mobile apps (90%), with elicitation and analysis being the most studied activities.

Conclusion: The study highlights growth in dataset usage, dependency on dominant platforms, need for diversified sources, and expansion into other RE activities for broader insights.

Abstract: [Background] Research on requirements engineering (RE) for mobile apps
employs datasets formed by app users, developers or vendors. However, little is
known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on
datasets, are requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. [Conclusions]
Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.

*Cheng-Yang Tsai,Tzu-Wei Huang,Jen-Wei Shih,I-Hsiang Wang,Yu-Cheng Lin,Rung-Bin Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses automated error diagnosis in APB transactions for SoC designs, proposing a hierarchical Random Forest-driven framework that achieves 91.36% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies and errors in manual debugging of APB transactions in large VCD files in the EDA domain.

Method: The approach utilizes a hierarchical Random Forest architecture with four pre-trained binary classifiers for multi-stage error diagnosis on APB transactions.

Result: The framework delivers 91.36% accuracy, excelling in address-related fault detection with high precision and recall, and robust performance in data error handling.

Conclusion: Hierarchical machine learning demonstrates strong potential for automated hardware debugging in EDA, validated by competitive contest results.

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful
automated tool for hardware debugging in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

### [260] [Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668)
*Matt Rau,Chris Brown,John Edwards*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces algorithms to track parse tree nodes over time in student programming code, enabling new types of analysis on programming process data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of tracking high-level code representations (like abstract syntax trees) through time, especially in unparseable states, and to enhance the understanding of student programming behavior.

Method: Developed two algorithms to track parse tree nodes and handle unparseable states; applied these on keystroke data from a 2021 CS1 course to analyze resulting parse trees.

Result: Discovered new statistics like deletion rates inside/outside conditionals, restoration of commented-out code, and insights on code jumping behavior.

Conclusion: The algorithms allow novel insights into programming behaviors and syntactic challenges, paving the way for scalable analysis of programming education.

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

*Rodrigo Oliveira Zacarias,Rodrigo Pereira dos Santos,Patricia Lago*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SECO-TransDX, a conceptual model to study transparency in software ecosystems from a Developer Experience perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the relationship between transparency and Developer Experience (DX) in software ecosystems.

Method: The conceptual model SECO-TransDX was developed based on prior research and a Delphi study involving academic and industry experts.

Result: The model identifies 63 interrelated concepts that shape transparency during developer interactions in technical, social, and organizational layers.

Conclusion: SECO-TransDX provides researchers and practitioners with insights and tools to improve transparency, enhance DX, and promote long-term engagement in software ecosystems.

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

### [262] [VulRTex: A Reasoning-Guided Approach to Identify Vulnerabilities from Rich-Text Issue Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03875)
*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Guowei Yang,Lin Shi,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes VulRTex, an advanced approach for identifying vulnerability-related issue reports (IRs) in open-source software by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for reasoning-based analysis. Its high performance is validated with significant improvements over baselines, both in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually identifying vulnerability-related issue reports in open-source software is time-intensive, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks due to delays. Existing automatic approaches are limited as they fail to leverage the rich-text information comprehensively.

Method: The authors introduce VulRTex, which uses reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a Vulnerability Reasoning Database from historical IRs. It retrieves relevant cases from this database to guide reasoning analysis for identifying vulnerabilities in target IRs' rich-text data.

Result: VulRTex improves performance in identifying vulnerability-related IRs on a dataset of 973,572 IRs. It outperforms the best baseline by +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and +10.5% Macro-F1, while halving the time cost of baseline reasoning approaches. It successfully identified 30 emerging vulnerabilities in 2024 GitHub IRs, 11 of which received CVE-IDs.

Conclusion: VulRTex's reasoning-guided approach demonstrates both practicality and significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency for identifying vulnerability-related IRs in open-source software. Its success underscores its value in enhancing software security workflow.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

TL;DR: This study evaluates tools for identifying software versions affected by vulnerabilities, revealing poor tool performance and proposing advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of vulnerable software versions is vital for patching and risk mitigation, but the effectiveness of existing tools remains unclear.

Method: A benchmark of 1,128 C/C++ vulnerabilities was used to evaluate 12 tools across dimensions like effectiveness, root cause analysis, sensitivity to patches, and ensemble strategies.

Result: The tools evaluated showed fundamental limitations, none exceeding 45.0% accuracy. Ensemble strategies improved accuracy by up to 10.1%, but total accuracy stayed below 60.0%.

Conclusion: Current tools fail to perform adequately, indicating the need for fundamentally new approaches and providing actionable insights for advancement.

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained

### [264] [Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896)
*Zushuai Zhang,Elliott Wen,Ewan Tempero*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study finds that interactions between code smells increase overall dependencies between code modules, making maintenance more difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintenance complexity due to module dependencies and the role of code smells in increasing these dependencies.

Method: Analyzed static dependencies in 116 open-source Java systems to quantify code smell interactions compared to non-smelly code.

Result: Interactions between code smell pairs increase total dependencies, such as Feature Envy methods and Data Classes showing a sevenfold increase.

Conclusion: To reduce dependency-related maintenance challenges, developers should focus on addressing interacting code smells rather than isolated ones.

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Auth Shim,' a proxy service pattern for bridging enterprise Identity Providers and open-source applications that lack native security protocol support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security integration gaps between enterprise Identity Providers (e.g., SAML, OIDC) and standalone OSS tools.

Method: Proposes the 'Auth Shim,' an external proxy service that uses secure administrative APIs of OSS tools for translating enterprise security protocols.

Result: Implemented at Adobe to integrate an OSS BI tool with Okta SAML, achieving automated RBAC and eliminating manual user provisioning.

Conclusion: Offers a reusable and secure blueprint for seamlessly integrating OSS tools into enterprise SSO ecosystems without compromising security governance.

Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but
standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,
creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to
embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepoDebug, a multi-task, multi-language debugging dataset addressing limitations in current datasets and evaluates 10 LLMs, finding performance challenges in repository-level debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debugging datasets focus mostly on function-level code debugging, not repository-level scenarios. The latter are more complex and realistic but underexplored due to diversity and coverage gaps.

Method: The authors developed RepoDebug, a repository-level dataset with 22 error subtypes in 8 programming languages and supported 3 debugging tasks. They evaluated 10 LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnect.

Result: RepoDebug addresses the limitations of previous debugging datasets. Experiments show that even the best-performing LLM, Claude 3.5 Sonnect, struggles with repository-level debugging scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges in repository-level debugging. RepoDebug is a valuable resource for benchmarking and addressing this gap to improve debugging efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

*Haowei Quan,Junjie Wang,Xinzhe Li,Terry Yue Zhuo,Xiao Chen,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyVul, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for Python-package vulnerabilities, featuring 1,157 verified vulnerabilities, detailed annotations, and evaluations of existing detection tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rising concerns of vulnerabilities in Python packages, which are exacerbated by Python's interaction with other languages and the under-explored effectiveness of current detection tools.

Method: The authors created PyVul, a large-scale benchmark suite with verified vulnerabilities, implemented LLM-assisted data cleansing to ensure label accuracy, and conducted vulnerability distribution analyses.

Result: PyVul achieved 100% commit-level and 94% function-level label accuracy. Analysis highlighted the prevalence of vulnerabilities in multi-lingual Python packages and exposed gaps in current vulnerability detection tools.

Conclusion: The study establishes PyVul as a precise benchmark for Python vulnerabilities, identifies weaknesses in current detection tools, and emphasizes the need for improved methodologies to address these issues.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaaSGuard is a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline for serverless computing, addressing security challenges in open-source platforms like OpenFaaS through lightweight security checks in all development stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless computing introduces unique security challenges due to its ephemeral execution and scalability, which are not effectively addressed by existing security methods.

Method: The paper proposes FaaSGuard, a systematic DevSecOps pipeline embedding fail-closed security measures into every stage of the software lifecycle, ensuring continuous vulnerability prevention.

Result: Experimental validation with 20 real-world serverless functions shows FaaSGuard achieves 95% precision and 91% recall in detecting vulnerabilities while maintaining CI/CD continuity.

Conclusion: FaaSGuard provides an effective, integrated security framework for serverless applications, enhancing detection and prevention of critical vulnerabilities without disrupting workflows.

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register

and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

*Timothee Robert,MohammadAli Shaeri,Mahsa Shoaran*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes BiND, a two-stage model for decoding bimanual hand movements using intracortical recordings, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods and showing robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of decoding bimanual movements in BCIs caused by overlapping neural representations and complex interlimb interactions.

Method: The proposed BiND model uses a two-stage approach: motion type classification followed by GRU-based decoders augmented with a trial-relative time index to estimate 2D hand velocities.

Result: BiND achieved a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 for unimanual and 0.69 for bimanual motion prediction, outperforming existing models by 2%. It demonstrated up to 4% accuracy improvement in cross-session analyses.

Conclusion: The study highlights BiND's effectiveness in leveraging task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling to improve bimanual decoding in BCIs.

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent Networks (HORNs) in analog-electronic hardware, showing its potential for energy-efficient computation despite precision differences affecting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the feasibility and computational efficiency of implementing oscillatory recurrent networks, such as HORNs, in analog-electronic hardware, leveraging transient dynamics for energy-efficient computation.

Method: The paper uses a digital twin approach to train a four-node HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification, then transfers the trained parameters to an analog electronic implementation to analyze performance using custom error metrics.

Result: The analog implementation replicated the digital model's dynamics successfully in most cases, but precision differences led to a 28.39% agreement in predictions. Re-training the linear readout layer restored classification performance to match the digital twin.

Conclusion: Analog electronic circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation. This proof-of-concept demonstrates their potential as energy-efficient systems while leveraging transient dynamics for computational processes.

Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent
Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed,
and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet,
while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor
dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in
analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far
are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in
analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of
the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node
HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained
parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error
metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the
dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall
well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on
the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement
with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch
is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the
floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform
classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a
re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to
that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the
analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic
circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation,
providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit
brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.

*Mauricio Girardi-Schappo,Leonard Maler,André Longtin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-coding scheme in recurrent neural networks, combining firing rate and spatial spike patterns, to optimize signal encoding, especially for weak stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how weak stimuli can be reliably encoded in recurrent neuron populations, especially when traditional firing rate-based methods are unreliable.

Method: A stochastic recurrent excitable network with single-cell threshold adaptation is analyzed to study how this mechanism improves encoding of weak signals.

Result: The dual-coding strategy exploits firing rate variance and spatial spike patterns, optimizing mutual information through threshold adaptation. Adaptation reduces internal noise and is crucial for weak signal encoding, particularly around criticality.

Conclusion: Threshold adaptation enables robust and efficient information encoding, suggesting its key role in both biological and artificial neural networks, especially under near-critical dynamics.

Abstract: Recurrently connected neuron populations play key roles in sensory perception
and memory storage across various brain regions. While these populations are
often assumed to encode information through firing rates, this method becomes
unreliable with weak stimuli. We propose that in such cases, information can be
transmitted via spatial spike patterns, employing a sparse or combinatorial
coding based on firing rate variance. Around the critical point of a stochastic
recurrent excitable network, we uncover a synergistic dual-coding scheme,
enabled by single-cell threshold adaptation. This scheme optimizes variance
coding for weak signals without compromising rate coding for stronger inputs,
thus maximizing input/output mutual information. These optimizations are robust
across adaptation rules and coupling strengths through self-suppression of
internal noise, particularly around the network's phase transition, and are
linked to threshold recovery times observed in hippocampal memory circuits
(~$10^2$-$10^3$ms). In contrast, nonadaptive networks perform similarly only at
criticality, suggesting that threshold adaptation is essential for reliable
encoding of weak signals into diverse spatial patterns. Our results imply a
fundamental role for near-critical latent adaptive dynamics enabled by dual
coding in biological and artificial neural networks.

### [273] [Energy-Weighted Flow Matching: Unlocking Continuous Normalizing Flows for Efficient and Scalable Boltzmann Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03726)
*Niclas Dern,Lennart Redl,Sebastian Pfister,Marcel Kollovieh,David Lüdke,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training method for continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions efficiently without requiring large datasets or extensive energy evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann distributions is crucial for scientific applications but is computationally difficult in high-dimensional energy landscapes. Current methods either need large datasets or cannot fully utilize advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows for efficient sampling.

Method: The proposed EWFM objective reformulates conditional flow matching via importance sampling, enabling training with samples from any proposal distribution. Two algorithms, iEWFM and aEWFM, are developed based on this: iEWFM iteratively refines proposals, while aEWFM incorporates temperature annealing for complex landscapes.

Result: On benchmark tasks, including high-dimensional Lennard-Jones clusters, EWFM algorithms achieve competitive sample quality compared with state-of-the-art methods while using up to 1,000 times fewer energy evaluations.

Conclusion: EWFM provides an effective and computationally efficient approach to modeling Boltzmann distributions, leveraging modern generative models without the need for extensive datasets or energy evaluations.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions
$\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many
scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex,
high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern
generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of
samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy
evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of
advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown
promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce
Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling
continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy
function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via
importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal
distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative
EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training,
and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature
annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including
challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate
sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while
requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces four new methods to test correlations between node features and network structure, offering theoretical guarantees, computational efficiency, and reduced assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether nodal covariates correlate with network structures, which is essential in multiple domains.

Method: Two methods use linear models linking covariates to latent node variables. The other two utilize canonical correlation analysis to bypass linear modeling assumptions.

Result: The approaches are supported by theoretical guarantees under latent space models and show strong performance in simulations and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform previous approaches by being computationally efficient and reducing modeling assumptions.

Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features.
In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates
are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel
methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model
relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive
network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation
analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear
modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods
when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space
model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be
high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer
modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We
demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated
and real-world data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper improves diffusion model efficiency by integrating compressed sensing into its workflow, optimizing both data training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate diffusion model inference and training during synthetic data generation by utilizing dimension reduction techniques.

Method: The method involves compressing data into a latent space, training a diffusion model within that space, and employing compressed sensing for efficient sparse recovery of generated samples.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates faster convergence, provides an optimal value for latent space dimension, and proves efficacy through experiments on various datasets like images and financial time series.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances the efficiency of diffusion models, making them more practical for computationally demanding applications in diverse fields.

Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.

TL;DR: The paper develops a method using triangular normalizing flows with invertible mappings for generative modeling in a Bayesian framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inverse problems in Bayesian frameworks by enabling conditional sampling for simulation and inference.

Method: The approach involves combining two triangular normalizing flows into one invertible mapping and proposing a training loss to directly train this mapping.

Result: Illustrates the practical utility of the method through numerical experiments on stylized examples.

Conclusion: The method provides a novel tool for conditional generative modeling with properties beneficial for both simulation and inference.

Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study introduces a bandit framework using the MNL model for stochastic matching tasks, addressing computational efficiency and regret optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational costs and regret optimization in stochastic matching scenarios where preference-based decisions are complex and require combinatorial optimization.

Method: The authors propose batched algorithms that update matching infrequently, reducing average computational cost while maintaining a regret bound.

Result: The framework achieves an amortized computational cost of $O(1)$ per round and a regret bound of $	ilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces computational costs without sacrificing performance, promising efficient solutions for stochastic matching problems.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching
based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents
on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm
stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown
preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize
regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all
agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based
on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur
a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we
propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates,
thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per
round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Motivation: To better understand the relationships and equivalences between popular post-training methods and explore alternatives for alignment without relying on explicit reinforcement learning techniques.

Method: The paper analyzes and connects various reinforcement learning approaches, test-time scaling techniques, and introduces resampling methods for diffusion models.

Result: Finds intrinsic links between different post-training methods and proposes a resampling approach that replaces explicit reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Post-training methods share deeper connections than previously understood, and alignment can be achieved using resampling techniques instead of traditional reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In this note, we reflect on several fundamental connections among widely used
post-training techniques. We clarify some intimate connections and equivalences
between reinforcement learning with human feedback, reinforcement learning with
internal feedback, and test-time scaling (particularly soft best-of-$N$
sampling), while also illuminating intrinsic links between diffusion guidance
and test-time scaling. Additionally, we introduce a resampling approach for
alignment and reward-directed diffusion models, sidestepping the need for

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper presents COBRA, a deep learning framework utilizing wrist-worn sensors for monitoring obesity-related behaviors. It demonstrates high accuracy (96.86%) and strong performance in recognizing activities like food intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in traditional methods for monitoring energy balance behaviors in obesity management, such as underreporting, recall bias, and integration challenges with digital health systems.

Method: COBRA employs a hybrid D-Net architecture that combines U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM for temporal processing. It utilizes wrist-worn multimodal sensors and applies spectral-temporal feature extraction for activity classification.

Result: The framework achieved an overall accuracy of 96.86% on the WISDM-Smart dataset, with high category-specific F1-scores and improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: COBRA offers a scalable, accurate, and demographically robust solution for obesity-related behavioral monitoring, paving the way for personalized obesity interventions.

Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance
behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant
underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern
digital health systems. This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral
Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective
behavioral monitoring using wrist-worn multimodal sensors. COBRA integrates a
hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head
self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily
activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical
Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart
dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal
preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving
high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86%
overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical
Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily
Living), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 1.18% in accuracy. The
framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%),
enabling scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and
continuous lifestyle monitoring.

*Paresh Baidya,Rourab Paul,Vikas Srivastava,Sumit Kumar Debnath*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses fault detection in hardware implementations of Post-Quantum Cryptographic algorithms, proposing a novel method called RESWO alongside enhancements to existing techniques RENO and RESO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intentional fault injection attacks can compromise the implementation of PQC algorithms, such as Kyber, potentially leaking sensitive information.

Method: The paper introduces the new fault detection technique, RESWO, alongside adapting existing methods, RENO and RESO, for Barrett Reduction in Kyber's Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit on FPGA. It analyzes their efficiency and resource usage.

Result: RESWO demonstrates similar slice usage to RENO and RESO but incurs lesser delay while all three methods achieve near-100% fault detection efficiency.

Conclusion: RESWO contributes to efficient and lightweight fault detection in Barrett Reduction with improved performance over existing methods, advancing the security of hardware implementations in PQC.

Abstract: A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally
injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)
algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in
side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The
recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also
leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three
efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for
Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are
fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including
Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new
algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection.
While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted
Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett
Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices
compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both
RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is
nearly 100%.

*Siddharth Muralee,Sourag Cherupattamoolayil,James C. Davis,Antonio Bianchi,Aravind Machiry*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Reactive Bottom-Up Testing paradigm for better detecting software vulnerabilities, implemented as "Griller." It improves on existing methods by validating function behavior within broader program contexts and addressing false positives, detecting known and new vulnerabilities effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic testing techniques, typically top-down approaches, struggle to exercise functions deep in the call graph, while previous bottom-up methods suffer from false positives and lack contextual validity.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage Reactive Bottom-Up Testing scheme: 1) Identify likely vulnerable functions and create context-aware test harnesses, 2) Use fuzzing and symbolic execution to find crashes and extract constraints, 3) Verify crashes and remove false positives by combining constraints. They implemented and tested this scheme in a prototype tool called "Griller."

Result: "Griller" successfully identified 28 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects and discovered 6 new vulnerabilities in real-world applications such as Pacman.

Conclusion: The Reactive Bottom-Up Testing paradigm, exemplified by "Griller," enhances vulnerability detection in complex software systems by combining function-level analysis with broader program context validation. This approach holds promise for advancing security testing practices.

Abstract: Modern computing systems remain rife with software vulnerabilities. Engineers
apply many means to detect them, of which dynamic testing is one of the most
common and effective. However, most dynamic testing techniques follow a
top-down paradigm, and struggle to reach and exercise functions deep within the
call graph. While recent works have proposed Bottom-Up approaches to address
these limitations, they face challenges with false positives and generating
valid inputs that adhere to the context of the entire program.
  In this work, we introduce a new paradigm that we call Reactive Bottom-Up
Testing. Our insight is that function-level testing is necessary but not
sufficient for the validation of vulnerabilities in functions. What we need is
a systematic approach that not only tests functions in isolation but also
validates their behavior within the broader program context, ensuring that
detected vulnerabilities are both reachable and triggerable. We develop a
three-stage bottom-up testing scheme: (1) identify likely-vulnerable functions
and generate type- and context-aware harnesses; (2) fuzz to find crashes and
extract input constraints via symbolic execution; (3) verify crashes by
combining constraints to remove false positives. We implemented an automated
prototype, which we call Griller. We evaluated Griller in a controlled setting
using a benchmark of 48 known vulnerabilities across 5 open-source projects,
where we successfully detected 28 known vulnerabilities. Additionally, we
evaluated Griller on several real-world applications such as Pacman, and it
discovered 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities. Our findings suggest that
Reactive Bottom-Up Testing can significantly enhance the detection of
vulnerabilities in complex systems, paving the way for more robust security
practices.

### [282] [BIDO: A Unified Approach to Address Obfuscation and Concept Drift Challenges in Image-based Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03807)
*Junhui Li,Chengbin Feng,Zhiwei Yang,Qi Mo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BIDO is a hybrid image-based malware detection method addressing obfuscation and concept drift challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based malware detection methods face challenges like performance loss due to obfuscation and concept drift, which are rooted in out-of-distribution issues.

Method: BIDO introduces three components: a local feature selection module for identifying key subregions in malware images, modeling pairwise cross-modal dependencies for extracting stable co-occurrence patterns, and a learnable metric for compact feature representation irrespective of obfuscation or drift.

Result: BIDO outperformed existing baselines on real-world datasets, demonstrating enhanced robustness against obfuscation and concept drift.

Conclusion: BIDO proves effective in improving malware detection performance by addressing the shared statistical challenges of obfuscation and concept drift.

Abstract: To identify malicious Android applications, various malware detection
techniques have been proposed. Among them, image-based approaches are
considered potential alternatives due to their efficiency and scalability.
Recent studies have reported that these approaches suffer significant
performance declines when confronted with obfuscation or concept drift.
However, existing solutions often treat these two challenges as different
problems, offering independent solutions. These techniques overlook the fact
that both challenges share a common statistical root, out-of-distribution, and
research from this perspective remains limited. In response, we propose BIDO, a
hybrid image-based malware detector designed to enhance robustness against both
obfuscation and concept drift simultaneously. Specifically, to improve the
discriminative power of image features, we introduce a local feature selection
module that identifies informative subregions within malware images. Second, to
enhance feature robustness, we model pairwise cross-modal dependencies in an
outer product space, enabling the extraction of stable co-occurrence patterns.
Third, to ensure feature compactness, we design a learnable metric that pulls
samples with identical labels closer while pushing apart those with different
labels, regardless of obfuscation or concept drift. Extensive experiments on
the real-world datasets demonstrate that BIDO significantly outperforms
existing baselines, achieving higher robustness against both concept drift and
obfuscation. The source code is available at:

*Chuhan Zhang,Ye Zhang,Bowen Shi,Yuyou Gan,Tianyu Du,Shouling Ji,Dazhan Deng,Yingcai Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroBreak, a system that analyzes neuron-level vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) to strengthen their defenses against jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks are increasingly bypassing the safety alignment of LLMs, necessitating robust defense strategies rooted in an understanding of neuron-level vulnerabilities and security mechanisms.

Method: The authors designed NeuroBreak, a system using layer-wise representation probing and neuron analysis from semantic and functional perspectives, to investigate the safety mechanisms within LLMs.

Result: NeuroBreak successfully provides mechanistic insights into LLM vulnerabilities and analyzes various jailbreak attack methods, validated through quantitative evaluations and case studies.

Conclusion: NeuroBreak enhances the understanding of LLM security vulnerabilities and supports the development of next-generation defense strategies against adversarial jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving
jailbreak attacks.

### [284] [LMAE4Eth: Generalizable and Robust Ethereum Fraud Detection by Exploring Transaction Semantics and Masked Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03939)
*Yifan Jia,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Ye Tian,Peng Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework combining transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge to improve Ethereum fraud detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods fail to capture transaction semantics, struggle with homogeneous transaction data, and face scalability issues in self-supervised graph learning.

Method: LMAE4Eth combines transaction-token contrastive language models for semantic representation, masked account graph autoencoders for node-level detection, and cross-attention fusion to integrate embeddings.

Result: LMAE4Eth outperformed 21 baseline approaches, improving F1-score by over 10% on two datasets.

Conclusion: By addressing semantic and scalability challenges, LMAE4Eth provides a robust solution for Ethereum fraud detection with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

*Omri Sgan Cohen,Ehud Malul,Yair Meidan,Dudu Mimran,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: KubeGuard, a new framework, addresses Kubernetes security issues by using runtime logs and large language models to recommend least-privilege configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Kubernetes security focuses mainly on detecting misconfigurations, leaving a need for solutions that actively mitigate overly permissive configurations to enhance cluster security.

Method: KubeGuard uses runtime logs and large language models (LLMs) in modular prompt-chaining workflows to create and refine Kubernetes manifests, generating recommendations for least-privilege configurations.

Result: KubeGuard successfully improves Kubernetes manifest security for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, demonstrating high precision, recall, and F1-scores in evaluations using both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: KubeGuard proves to be an effective framework for translating runtime observability into actionable security recommendations, reducing the attack surface in Kubernetes clusters.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

*Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Yiming Wang,Semih Esenlik,Zhaobin Zhang,Kai Zhang,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhanced filtering techniques in neural video compression, showing a significant reduction in bit rate compared to existing codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural video compression efficiency through systematic enhancement filtering approaches.

Method: Categorized enhancement techniques into in-loop contextual filtering (mitigates error propagation) and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement (refines reconstruction quality), and proposed an adaptive strategy for applying these techniques.

Result: Achieved a 7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancement filtering approaches are effective in improving neural video compression and set a foundation for further exploration in this domain.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Junqi Liao,Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Zhipin Deng,Li Li,Dong Liu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec with innovations improving alignment and stability in video encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize neural video codecs (NVCs) by addressing inefficiencies in reference and hierarchical quality structures.

Method: Three innovations are proposed: hierarchical multi-reference structure, encoder-side lookahead strategy, and layer-wise quality scale with random quality training.

Result: EHVC demonstrates significantly better performance compared to state-of-the-art NVCs.

Conclusion: The improvements in EHVC enhance coding efficiency and resolve structural mismatches in hierarchical NVC designs.

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code
will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.

*Harald Störrle,Anastasia Hort*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simpler and efficient model to predict surgery durations using limited data and expert knowledge, outperforming previous complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing operating theater utilization can reduce hospital costs and enhance medical outcomes. Previous methods require large datasets, which may not always be available.

Method: The researchers combined factor analysis with regression methods, while integrating qualitative insights from practitioners to make better use of small clinical datasets.

Result: Simpler methods of central tendency performed as well or better compared to complex literature models, especially when expert knowledge was combined with data analysis.

Conclusion: Integrating qualitative studies with data-driven methods yields accurate predictions even with limited data, presenting a practical approach for clinical settings.

Abstract: Context: Utilization of operating theaters is a major cost driver in
hospitals. Optimizing this variable through optimized surgery schedules may
significantly lower cost and simultaneously improve medical outcomes. Previous
studies proposed various complex models to predict the duration of procedures,
the key ingredient to optimal schedules. They did so perusing large amounts of
data.
  Goals: We aspire to create an effective and efficient model to predict
operation durations based on only a small amount of data. Ideally, our model is
also simpler in structure, and thus easier to use.
  Methods: We immerse ourselves in the application domain to leverage
practitioners expertise. This way, we make the best use of our limited supply
of clinical data, and may conduct our data analysis in a theory-guided way. We
do a combined factor analysis and develop regression models to predict the
duration of the perioperative process.
  Findings: We found simple methods of central tendency to perform on a par
with much more complex methods proposed in the literature. In fact, they
sometimes outperform them. We conclude that combining expert knowledge with
data analysis may improve both data quality and model performance, allowing for
more accurate forecasts.
  Conclusion: We yield better results than previous researchers by integrating
conventional data science methods with qualitative studies of clinical settings
and process structure. Thus, we are able to leverage even small datasets.

*Przemyslaw Korzeniowski,Niels Hald,Fernando Bello*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper discusses a parallel implementation of the Cosserat rod model for physics simulations, achieving substantial performance boosts using GPU computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency for simulating elastic rods, which are crucial for modeling objects such as catheters and ropes.

Method: Developed a massively-parallel GPU implementation of the CoRdE and an inextensible modification, leveraging CUDA and inter-block synchronization.

Result: Achieved significant performance improvements: x40.0 speed-up for the extensible CoRdE implementation and x15.11 for the inextensible version.

Conclusion: The GPU approach enables real-time, accurate simulation of elastic rods, making it suitable for applications like haptic interaction in medical simulations.

Abstract: An elastic rod is a long and thin body able to sustain large global
deformations, even if local strains are small. The Cosserat rod is a non-linear
elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending,
stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based
computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical
instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a
massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our
inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and
using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics
time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming
multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant
computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When
executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the
original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU
implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average
speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version. Simulating a
catheter/guidewire pair (2x512 Cosserat elements) in a cardiovascular
application resulted in a 13.5 fold performance boost, enabling for accurate
real-time simulation at haptic interactive rates (0.5-1kHz).

*Ruofan Liang,Kai He,Zan Gojcic,Igor Gilitschenski,Sanja Fidler,Nandita Vijaykumar,Zian Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LuxDiT introduces a novel diffusion model that estimates HDR lighting maps from visual input, excelling in both synthetic and real-world scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene lighting estimation remains difficult due to limited HDR ground-truth data and challenges in inferring non-local context.

Method: They fine-tuned a video diffusion transformer on large synthetic datasets and employed a low-rank adaptation strategy for improved semantic alignment.

Result: LuxDiT demonstrated superior performance in lighting prediction with realistic high-frequency details, surpassing existing techniques.

Conclusion: The approach succeeds in generalizing effectively to real-world conditions, providing accurate lighting predictions and advancing state-of-the-art in this domain.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ContraGS introduces a method for compressed training of high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting models, overcoming memory limitations, and preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address high memory consumption and inefficiencies during training and rendering 3D Gaussian Splatting models without reducing quality.

Method: ContraGS leverages codebooks for compressed representation and employs Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling to train non-differentiable parameters.

Result: ContraGS achieves significant reductions in memory usage (3.49X), quicker training (1.36X), and faster rendering (1.88X) while maintaining near state-of-the-art model quality.

Conclusion: ContraGS provides an effective solution for memory-efficient and faster training of 3D Gaussian Splatting models, retaining high scene representation quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset, and TensoIS, a learning-based model for estimating heterogeneous scattering parameters using Fractal Perlin noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in modeling heterogeneous media scattering parameters, which is challenging due to the lack of suitable distributions or effective learning-based methods.

Method: The method involves creating the HeteroSynth dataset with Fractal Perlin noise and developing TensoIS, a feed-forward framework utilizing low-rank tensor components for scattering parameter estimation.

Result: The framework successfully predicts scattering parameters for synthetic, simulated, and real-world heterogeneous media, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This study pioneers the use of Perlin noise for modeling heterogeneous scattering and provides a learning-based solution for inverse scattering estimation in heterogeneous media.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

*Lei Zhong,Yi Yang,Changjian Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SMooGPT, a fine-tuned language model for generating stylized human motion, leveraging natural language descriptions at a body-part level for better interpretability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing motion generation approaches, such as low interpretability, restricted generalization to new styles, and dataset bias.

Method: Utilizes body-part text descriptions as intermediate representations and fine-tunes a language model to serve as reasoner, composer, and generator of stylized motions.

Result: SMooGPT enables fine-grained motion control, resolves conflicts between motion content and style, and demonstrates robust generalization to new styles through experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves interpretability, control, and style adaptability in stylized motion generation, pushing the boundaries in the field.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

*Dongliang Cao,Guoxing Sun,Marc Habermann,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for generating dynamic human avatars that combine photorealism and pose-dependent realism by integrating person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either focus on high photorealism for specific individuals, or produce cartoonish avatars with limited pose-realism, but struggle to generalize identity and maintain high rendering quality.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage pipeline: first optimizing person-specific UNets for pose deformations, then training a hyper diffusion model to generate network weights for rendering diverse avatars.

Result: The method yields real-time rendering of dynamic human avatars and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods using a large-scale multi-view video dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations, enabling the generation of dynamic and controllable avatars for diverse identities.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

### [296] [Contextualized Token Discrimination for Speech Search Query Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04393)
*Junyu Lu,Di Jiang,Mengze Hong,Victor Junqiu Wei,Qintian Guo,Zhiyang Su*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel Contextualized Token Discrimination (CTD) method for improving speech query correction in ASR systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance query spelling correction for speech searches, addressing challenges of errors generated by Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.

Method: The method uses BERT for token-level contextualized representations, applies a composition layer for semantic enhancement, and corrects queries by comparing original and contextualized token representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CTD outperforms other approaches across all metrics, and a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions is introduced.

Conclusion: CTD proves effective for speech query correction, offering both a robust method and a valuable benchmark for evaluating correction techniques.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

### [297] [AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04345)
*Qizhou Wang,Hanxun Huang,Guansong Pang,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces AUDETER, a large and diverse dataset for detecting deepfake audio, addressing shortcomings in existing datasets and improving detection accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome the domain shift issues that make existing deepfake audio detection unreliable in real-world environments with evolving technologies and diverse audio samples.

Method: The authors created AUDETER, a large-scale dataset comprising over 3 million audio clips generated by 11 TTS models and 10 vocoders, combining diverse patterns for training and evaluating deepfake audio detectors.

Result: Experiments on AUDETER showed that state-of-the-art methods struggle with unseen audio without it, but models trained on AUDETER reduced detection error rates significantly, achieving 4.17% on cross-domain samples.

Conclusion: AUDETER provides significant advancements for training generalized deepfake audio detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world environments and fostering further research in this domain.

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.
AUDETER is available on GitHub.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper presents MatterVial, a hybrid framework integrating feature-based models with latent representations from pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance material science predictions, achieving significant accuracy improvements while ensuring interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between traditional feature-based models offering chemical transparency and the predictive power of deep learning, addressing the need for high-performance, interpretable machine learning tools in materials science.

Method: MatterVial integrates latent representations from graph neural networks (MEGNet, ROOST, and ORB) with feature-based descriptors and symbolic regression. This hybrid approach augments feature-based models to leverage both transparency and deep learning's predictive strength.

Result: The proposed approach significantly reduces errors and improves accuracy—by up to 40%—on Matbench tasks, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs in several cases.

Conclusion: MatterVial provides a powerful and interpretable machine learning framework for materials science, aligning with explainable AI principles, and demonstrating potential for targeted and autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted
and autonomous materials discovery.

*Marco Vetrano,Tiziano Zingales,G. Massimo Palma,Salvatore Lorenzo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) as a novel, fault-tolerant method for studying exoplanetary atmospheres, reducing computational costs compared to traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead caused by the high-dimensional parameter space in traditional exoplanetary atmospheric analysis methods.

Method: The authors propose a framework utilizing QELMs, leveraging near-term quantum devices (e.g., IBM Fez), to process astrophysical data efficiently and fault-tolerantly.

Result: The paper demonstrates the fault tolerance of QELMs through direct implementation on IBM Fez and highlights their potential in simplifying complex astrophysical data analysis.

Conclusion: QELMs show promise in providing faster, more efficient, and accurate tools for exoplanetary atmospheric studies, showcasing the advancing role of quantum computing in astrophysics.

Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.

### [300] [Gravity Well Echo Chamber Modeling With An LLM-Based Confirmation Bias Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03832)
*Joseph Jackson,Georgiy Lapin,Jeremy E. Thompson*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved model for identifying social media echo chambers by incorporating confirmation bias into the 'gravity well' framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in existing models of echo chambers which often ignore the individual-level influence of confirmation bias in the spread of misinformation.

Method: The researchers extended the 'gravity well' model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias variable calculated through comparisons of user posting history and responses to diverse viewpoints.

Result: The model was validated on nineteen Reddit communities, showing enhanced accuracy in detecting echo chambers and identifying markers of community information health.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides a systematic way to account for confirmation bias in social media dynamics, offering tools to flag echo chambers and support misinformation containment efforts.

Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of
misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual
confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well"
model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells.
We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias
variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to
belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through
comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a
wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity
well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals
community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on
nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of
confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective
identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the
model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common
points of amplification.

TL;DR: SRWToolkit is an open-source toolkit for designing social robotic avatars with local large language models, emphasizing on-device functionality and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and speed up the creation of customizable robotic avatars while ensuring functionality without relying on cloud services.

Method: Developed a web-based toolkit supporting multimodal interactions, real-time customizations, and local LLM inference; tested usability through a small-scale user study.

Result: User study participants successfully designed and interacted with different robotic roles, reporting positive outcomes in usability, trust, and user experience.

Conclusion: The toolkit provides an efficient way to develop robotic avatars, promoting scalable research in human-robot interaction and enabling customization for diverse needs.

Abstract: We present SRWToolkit, an open-source Wizard of Oz toolkit designed to

interaction through text input, button-activated speech, and wake-word command.
The toolkit offers real-time configuration of avatar appearance, behavior,

ensures on-device functionality through local LLM inference. In our small-scale
user study ($n=11$), participants created and interacted with diverse robotic
roles (hospital receptionist, mathematics teacher, and driving assistant),
which demonstrated positive outcomes in the toolkit's usability, trust, and
user experience. The toolkit enables rapid and efficient development of robot
characters customized to researchers' needs, supporting scalable research in

### [302] [Privacy Perceptions in Robot-Assisted Well-Being Coaching: Examining the Roles of Information Transparency, User Control, and Proactivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04358)
*Atikkhan Faridkhan Nilgar,Manuel Dietrich,Kristof Van Laerhoven*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines factors shaping users' privacy perceptions in social robot interactions, emphasizing the importance of explicit user control over how personal data is used and shared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates privacy concerns in the context of social robots used as well-being coaches since these robots handle sensitive user information, yet little is known about the factors influencing users' privacy perceptions.

Method: An online study involving 200 participants was conducted to assess the impact of three factors on privacy perceptions: transparency of information usage, user control over data, and the robot's behavioral approach (proactive or reactive).

Result: The study found that explicit user control over data significantly enhanced privacy perceptions and trust, whereas transparency and proactivity had minimal or no significant impact on perceived privacy appropriateness.

Conclusion: User control is critical for improving privacy appropriateness and trust in social robots. Just providing transparency or proactivity without control mechanisms is insufficient, highlighting the need for further research to enable effective user management of robots' data practices.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field
of well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide
support alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching
interactions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,
making privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the
factors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine
three key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,
(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their
information, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts
proactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =
200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,
they additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information
is interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that
provided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived
privacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of
transparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,
and we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing
users or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.
These insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that
allow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially
when social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.

TL;DR: This study explores how gaze-based learning analytics, combined with user-friendly design and conversational AI, can enable effective educational insights for teachers and students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make gaze-based analytics accessible and meaningful in educational technology for better student cognition and instructional strategies.

Method: The paper used iterative design, user-centered design principles, and five studies involving users to develop a learning analytics dashboard with gaze data, complemented by a conversational agent powered by a large language model.

Result: The study revealed that gaze analytics become accessible and pedagogically useful with proper visualization, narrative scaffolding, and conversational AI to simplify data interpretation.

Conclusion: Gaze data and conversational agents can enhance classroom EdTech; design considerations are outlined to integrate complex data modalities effectively in education.

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large
language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by
enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

*Christian Merz,Lukas Schach,Marie Luisa Fiedler,Jean-Luc Lugrin,Carolin Wienrich,Marc Erich Latoschik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unobtrusive method for detecting user behavior changes in extended reality (XR) systems via a deep metric similarity learning-based biometric user model, which was proven effective through experimental evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and detection of user behavior changes in XR, especially due to the Proteus effect or bodily affordances caused by different avatars, while minimizing user input.

Method: The authors employed a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning to identify behavioral changes using high-dimensional embeddings. This was tested against non-learned motion analysis and subjective questionnaires in a study involving a fruit-collection task with avatars of varying heights.

Result: The proposed model outperformed alternative approaches by identifying behavior changes through motion data, confirming the effective manipulation of perceived body schema and validating the model's efficacy across various query-reference data pairings.

Conclusion: The deep metric similarity learning-based model offers advantages such as unobtrusive and scalable analysis, real-time evaluation, and user-specific insights, making it a generalizable tool for detecting behavior changes in various XR contexts.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: HumAIne-chatbot personalizes AI conversations using user profiling and reinforcement learning, showing improvement in user satisfaction and task achievement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems lack adaptability and personalization, overlooking individual user characteristics.

Method: Developed HumAIne-chatbot using a pre-trained profile framework on GPT-generated personas; refined through online reinforcement learning using both implicit and explicit signals.

Result: Experiments with 50 synthetic personas showed improvements in user satisfaction and task performance in personalized conditions.

Conclusion: AI-driven user profiling in conversational agents improves key interaction metrics and warrants further real-world validation.

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a deep learning framework for solving PDEs without requiring derivatives of the solution neural network, addressing computational challenges.

Result: The proposed approach enables solving PDEs in a computationally efficient manner, particularly for specific PDE types like second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs.

Conclusion: The ARDO method demonstrates its suitability for derivative-free deep learning-based PDE resolution, focusing on Fokker-Planck type problems.

Abstract: We propose ARDO method for solving PDEs and PDE-related problems with deep
learning techniques. This method uses a weak adversarial formulation but
transfers the random difference operator onto the test function. The main
advantage of this framework is that it is fully derivative-free with respect to
the solution neural network. This framework is particularly suitable for

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to improve climate model accuracy by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model to better parameterize small-scale processes like atmospheric gravity waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing significant uncertainties in climate models caused by unresolved small-scale atmospheric-oceanic processes such as gravity waves and turbulence.

Method: Fine-tuning NASA and IBM Research's large pre-trained foundation model (Prithvi WxC) with 2.3 billion parameters to create a deep learning-based parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperforms the baseline Attention U-Net in predictive performance, evidenced by a lower Hellinger distance (0.06 vs. baseline's 0.11).

Conclusion: AI foundation models show promise for versatile and reusable climate applications, enabling more accurate observations-driven parameterizations of earth system processes.

Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes
like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be
sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes
are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to
developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes
by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely
unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3
billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a
latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned
(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity
waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution
climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10
times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous
evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals
superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the
atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost
is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and
0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and
reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-
and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of
observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more
earth-system processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in solving PDE problems with high accuracy and scalability using neural networks motivate the development of a more flexible and effective approach.

Method: The authors propose a subdomain neural operator model capable of handling arbitrary Robin-type boundary conditions and use it as a preconditioner for iterative solvers. It also supports multilevel domain decomposition for large-scale PDE solutions.

Result: The method successfully addressed Maxwell's equations across varied problem sizes, resolutions, and conditions, enabling effective simulations and inverse design of multi-wavelength nanophotonic devices.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates significant potential in creating accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for practical, large-scale PDE problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate
and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

TL;DR: This paper uses machine learning on genetic and epidemiological data to study antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends in Campylobacter species, predicting increased resistance and economic burden by 2050.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the rising public health and economic challenges posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in Campylobacter spp., by leveraging genomic and epidemiological data.

Method: The study employs machine learning, specifically Random Forest models validated with bootstrap resampling, alongside time-series forecasting (SARIMA, SIR, Prophet), to predict AMR patterns using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and economic projections.

Result: The Random Forest model achieved 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes, identified key resistance determinants, and forecasted rising campylobacteriosis cases and healthcare costs. Enhanced models indicate sustained and increasing resistance trends.

Conclusion: If AMR trends in Campylobacter remain unchecked, cases and associated economic burdens could rise significantly by 2050. Machine learning offers effective tools for predictive modeling and resistance management.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic
challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.
This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data
from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity
(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by
the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns
in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK
from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance
determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We
investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene
for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with
bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%
accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,
SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially
exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden
projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced
Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by
incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend
modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing
fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.

### [310] [Sharp Convergence Rates of Empirical Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Spatio-Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04225)
*Marina Struleva,Shayan Hundrieser,Dominic Schuhmacher,Axel Munk*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper analyzes statistical properties of empirical plug-in estimators used in unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) for spatio-temporal point processes. It provides theoretical convergence rates based on intrinsic dimensions and variance assumptions and validates these for specific processes such as Poisson cluster and Hawkes processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and establish theoretical bounds for empirical UOT estimators when analyzing intensity measures observed from spatio-temporal point processes. This is crucial for applications in areas requiring precise transport metrics, such as physics, biology, and finance.

Method: The study models observations from weakly time-stationary point processes with intensity measures over expanding time windows. It introduces a sub-quadratic temporal growth variance condition and establishes convergence rates and bounds. Various processes are exemplified for validation.

Result: The authors demonstrate that as temporal variance growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate slows. They provide matching lower bounds and validate the variance condition using several spatio-temporal point processes.

Conclusion: The empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance achieves near-minimax rate optimality under the established assumptions. The results show broad applicability and provide insights into UOT metrics for complex spatio-temporal processes.

Abstract: We statistically analyze empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal
transport (UOT) formalisms, focusing on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance,
between general intensity measures based on observations from spatio-temporal
point processes. Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly
time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish
sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic
dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition
of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal
dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes
slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial
covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes,
including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox
processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower
bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish
near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.

### [311] [Avoidance of an unexpected obstacle without reinforcement learning: Why not using advanced control-theoretic tools?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03721)
*Cédric Join,Michel Fliess*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper evaluates collision avoidance methods using control strategies instead of reinforcement learning (RL), highlighting computational efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from criticisms of RL's inefficiency, needing excessive trials to learn new tasks.

Method: The authors use the Dubins' car model with flatness-based control and HEOL feedback, paired with a model-free predictive control approach, both tested via simulations.

Result: Both methods show robust performance against mismatches and disturbances, with the model-free approach performing slightly better in robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods demonstrate excellent robustness and computational efficiency compared to RL, making them practical alternatives for collision avoidance scenarios.

Abstract: This communication on collision avoidance with unexpected obstacles is
motivated by some critical appraisals on reinforcement learning (RL) which
"requires ridiculously large numbers of trials to learn any new task" (Yann
LeCun). We use the classic Dubins' car in order to replace RL with
flatness-based control, combined with the HEOL feedback setting, and the latest
model-free predictive control approach. The two approaches lead to convincing
computer experiments where the results with the model-based one are only
slightly better. They exhibit a satisfactory robustness with respect to
randomly generated mismatches/disturbances, which become excellent in the
model-free case. Those properties would have been perhaps difficult to obtain
with today's popular machine learning techniques in AI. Finally, we should
emphasize that our two methods require a low computational burden.

### [312] [Compatibility of Multiple Control Barrier Functions for Constrained Nonlinear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04220)
*Max H. Cohen,Eugene Lavretsky,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) for safely controlling nonlinear systems with multiple state constraints, specifically focusing on box constraints in vector-valued outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in synthesizing safe controllers for nonlinear systems subjected to multiple state constraints, as earlier works largely focus on single CBF constraints.

Method: The paper develops a framework utilizing multiple CBFs for systems with vector relative degrees. It ensures constraint compatibility, resulting in a locally Lipschitz continuous controller with a closed-form expression. The framework also analyzes the trade-offs between safety constraints and tracking objectives.

Result: Theoretical validation is provided, demonstrating compatibility of constraints and controller properties. Simulation results on a planar quadrotor show the framework's practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively ensures safe control of nonlinear systems under multiple constraints while maintaining desired system behavior, and is validated both theoretically and through simulations.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for the constrained
control of nonlinear systems; however, the majority of results in the
literature focus on systems subject to a single CBF constraint, making it
challenging to synthesize provably safe controllers that handle multiple state
constraints. This paper presents a framework for constrained control of
nonlinear systems subject to box constraints on the systems' vector-valued
outputs using multiple CBFs. Our results illustrate that when the output has a
vector relative degree, the CBF constraints encoding these box constraints are
compatible, and the resulting optimization-based controller is locally
Lipschitz continuous and admits a closed-form expression. Additional results
are presented to characterize the degradation of nominal tracking objectives in
the presence of safety constraints. Simulations of a planar quadrotor are
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

### [313] [Leveraging Equivariances and Symmetries in the Control Barrier Function Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04399)
*Adrian Wiltz,Dimos V. Dimarogonas*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging symmetries in system dynamics and constraints to simplify and save computation in generating Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBFs often require demanding calculations or detailed design, and the authors aim to reduce this complexity by leveraging structural symmetries.

Method: The approach involves examining equivariances (symmetries) in system dynamics and constraints to infer CBF properties using reachability analysis, even for non-symmetric constraints.

Result: The paper demonstrates that symmetries allow extrapolation of CBF values across domains from subset evaluations, leading to reduced computational needs. It also offers theoretical examples and numerical studies showing substantial efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Utilizing equivariances and symmetries in dynamics and constraints offers a promising avenue for simplifying CBF synthesis while maintaining robustness across various systems.

Abstract: The synthesis of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) often involves demanding
computations or a meticulous construction. However, structural properties of
the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these
challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,
loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.
Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances
in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs
derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their
CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to
significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even
leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we
show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to
construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide
examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study
investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF
synthesis.

### [314] [SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety Certificates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413)
*Babak Esmaeili,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a data-driven motion-planning framework for multi-agent systems in shared workspaces using convex optimization without explicit system models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe and dynamically feasible motion planning in obstacle-filled workspaces for multi-agent systems without relying on explicit system models.

Method: Each agent learns its behavior using convex semidefinite programming to create locally invariant ellipsoids and feedback gains, forming a tree of waypoints interconnected by dynamically feasible transitions. Safety is ensured using overlapping ellipsoids and a space-time reservation table.

Result: Agents generate synchronized, safe, and dynamically feasible trajectories using data and convex optimization, validated through simulation results.

Conclusion: The framework proves effective for multi-agent motion planning, ensuring safety, dynamic feasibility, and independence from explicit system models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.

### [315] [Reservoir Predictive Path Integral Control for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03839)
*Daisuke Inoue,Tadayoshi Matsumori,Gouhei Tanaka,Yuji Ito*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework integrating Echo-State Networks (ESNs) and Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to address fast learning and control of nonlinear dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in fast online identification and control of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems with improved computational efficiency and control performance.

Method: Combining reservoir computing through ESNs for fast dynamics learning with parallelized MPPI control for leveraging learned nonlinearities, along with an uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI) extension.

Result: URPPI demonstrates superior control performance in experiments with Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RPPI and its uncertainty-aware variant (URPPI) provide effective solutions for nonlinear dynamics control, offering enhanced performance and reduced costs in dynamic system applications.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

### [316] [Sample Efficient Certification of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03899)
*Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti,Andrea Del Prete*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper discusses verifying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) using a Lipschitz-based certification algorithm to ensure robust safety in dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of computing Control Invariant (CI) sets for ensuring system safety and the difficulty in verifying CBFs due to robust optimization constraints.

Method: Introduced a Lipschitz-based approach for verifying CBFs, enabling sample efficiency, and demonstrated this method through a numerical example.

Result: Validation of the proposed method showed its efficiency in verifying CBFs through numerical experimentation.

Conclusion: The proposed Lipschitz-based certification algorithm provides a practical and sample-efficient approach to verify CBFs, aiding safe system design.

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

### [317] [Sailing Towards Zero-Shot State Estimation using Foundation Models Combined with a UKF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04213)
*Tobin Holtmann,David Stenger,Andres Posada-Moreno,Friedrich Solowjow,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents the FM-UKF—a hybrid approach combining transformer-based system dynamics models with the UKF for zero-shot state estimation applicable to varying sensor configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditionally, state estimation requires significant manual effort for system identification and data collection, while foundation models in other domains already utilize pre-trained models to reduce such needs. This motivates creating zero-shot models to simplify deployment in system dynamics estimation.

Method: The FM-UKF introduces a hybrid method by integrating a transformer-based model of system dynamics with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), allowing generalization across unknown sensor configurations without retraining.

Result: The method was evaluated on container ship models with complex dynamics, achieving competitive trade-offs in accuracy, effort, and robustness against classical methods and end-to-end approaches.

Conclusion: FM-UKF demonstrates the potential for reducing manual system identification efforts in state estimation, supporting future research through an open-source benchmark and dataset.

Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires
extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

### [318] [Reinforcement Learning for Robust Ageing-Aware Control of Li-ion Battery Systems with Data-Driven Formal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04288)
*Rudi Coppola,Hovsep Touloujian,Pierfrancesco Ombrini,Manuel Mazo Jr*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven method for improving lithium-ion battery charging that balances fast charging and aging, combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and formal methods for optimized hybrid control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation centers on addressing the trade-off between fast charging and the long-term aging and loss of capacity in lithium-ion batteries, which is a key issue for modern battery technologies.

Method: The approach combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) for synthesizing individual battery charging controllers with data-driven formal methods for abstraction. The method uses Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis to generate a hybrid system by partitioning RL-based controllers into a switched structure.

Result: The resulting hybrid system achieves a discrete selection among RL-based controllers and provides probabilistic guarantees on the closed-loop performance of lithium-ion battery cells.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully integrates data-driven RL strategies with formal abstractions to design efficient, safe, and performance-assured battery charging systems.

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

### [319] [Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Adversarial Evidence in the Health Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03787)
*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and their robustness, particularly in the health domain, emphasizing how misinformation in retrieved evidence affects model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about potential misinformation spread within RAG systems when processing critical health-related questions, where incorrect responses can cause significant harm.

Method: Controlled experiments were conducted varying the type of retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, adversarial) and question framing by users to assess alignment between model outputs and ground-truth answers.

Result: Adversarial documents significantly degrade model alignment, but robustness persists when helpful evidence is included in the retrieval pool.

Conclusion: Designing safer RAG systems for high-stakes domains requires implementing retrieval safeguards, and public experimental results were provided to support future research.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github
repository.

*Or Shachar,Uri Katz,Yoav Goldberg,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NER Retriever, a framework for zero-shot Named Entity Retrieval using large language models (LLMs) without requiring fixed schemas or fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ad-hoc Named Entity Retrieval, where predefined type schemas are not available and user-defined descriptions are used to guide entity retrieval.

Method: Utilizes mid-layer transformer block vectors in LLMs for embedding entities and employs a contrastive projection network to align compatible types while separating unrelated ones.

Result: NER Retriever achieves superior performance compared to lexical and dense retrieval baselines across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: NER Retriever provides an effective, scalable, and schema-free solution for named entity retrieval, leveraging innovative representation strategies within LLMs.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

*Daryl Chang,Yi Wu,Jennifer She,Li Wei,Lukasz Heldt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Automated Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework to automatically optimize system objectives while ensuring secondary constraints, improving user experience and ecosystem stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems face challenges in maintaining secondary constraints while optimizing primary objectives, especially as system dynamics evolve.

Method: The ACT framework uses offline pairwise evaluations on unbiased data to identify minimal hyperparameter adjustments needed to meet guardrails and adapts through continuous retraining.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate ACT's effectiveness and real-world deployment in a large-scale production system.

Conclusion: ACT provides a scalable approach to enforcing secondary constraints in dynamic recommender systems without reliance on extensive manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for automating relevance evaluation in personalized search systems, aiming to improve efficiency and scalability compared to human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high costs and scalability limitations of human annotations necessitate an automated relevance evaluation method for personalized search systems.

Method: Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) are used to automate relevance evaluation, each step rigorously validated against human judgments to ensure reliability.

Result: LLMs demonstrated alignment with human annotations, improved evaluation efficiency, expanded query sets, optimized sampling designs, and enhanced assessment capabilities in large-scale search experiments.

Conclusion: Automating relevance evaluations with LLMs results in higher-quality metrics, reduced Minimum Detectable Effect in experiments, and scalable improvements for search systems.

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

*Dror Aiger,Bingyi Cao,Kaifeng Chen,Andre Araujo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a local-to-global image retrieval paradigm combining efficient local feature search with effective global feature re-ranking, resulting in improved retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in current image retrieval systems, which often overlook partial image matches due to reliance on computationally expensive local feature matching or less detailed global feature search.

Method: It combines efficient local feature search with on-the-fly global feature re-ranking based on local similarities. Multidimensional scaling is used to create embeddings that align with local retrieval characteristics.

Result: The proposed approach sets new state-of-the-art performances on benchmark image retrieval datasets like Revisited Oxford and Paris.

Conclusion: The integration of local and global retrieval techniques enhances scalability, retrieval precision, and computational efficiency in image search systems.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

Motivation: The need for improved methods to retrieve and understand technical content in the domains of hardware and software engineering.

Method: Technical-Embeddings utilize query expansion and contextual summarization, alongside fine-tuning of a bi-encoder BERT model with separate learning parameters.

Result: Technical-Embeddings outperformed baseline models in precision and recall across two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA.

Conclusion: Integrating query expansion and contextual summarization showcases effectiveness in enhancing retrieval of technical documents, benefiting engineering and product development workflows.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding
models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential
contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To
further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating efficient embeddings of users and items based on Pinterest data, improving ad retrieval and ranking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pinterest needed an effective system to personalize ad delivery based on complex relationships between users and items while ensuring scalability.

Method: A novel upstream-downstream framework generates and integrates asynchronous precomputed embeddings into downstream models using diverse data signals and sophisticated architectures.

Result: The system showed major performance enhancements both offline and online, now integrated into Pinterest's production, enhancing ad metrics significantly.

Conclusion: Using precomputed embeddings in downstream tasks proved effective and scalable, and successfully boosted Pinterest's ad ranking and retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,
resulting in significant gains in online metrics.

### [326] [Simplicity Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: A Strategic Perspective on Controllers in Reactive Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04129)
*Mickael Randour*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the complexity of strategies in game-theoretic controller synthesis, focusing on factors like memory, randomness, and broader notions of strategy complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how complex strategies impact controller synthesis, challenging the belief that simpler, limited-memory strategies are always better.

Method: The authors analyze recent findings regarding strategy requirements, including memory and randomness, and introduce alternative perspectives on complexity.

Result: Insights into the trade-offs between complexity, memory, randomness, and broader strategy considerations in synthesis contexts.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of evaluating strategy complexity in controller design, aiming for balance between simplicity and optimality.

Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the
interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game
between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal)
strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a
real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited
memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive
and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a
variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and
randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions
of complexity for strategies.

### [327] [An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03539)
*Chatipat Lorpaiboon,Jonathan Weare,Aaron R. Dinner*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper highlights an improved approach to estimate the committor and transition rates with less sensitivity to lag time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of bias in estimating committors from trajectory data due to dependency on lag time.

Method: Introduces an alternative mathematical expression that minimizes the committor error independent of lag time.

Result: Numerical tests on benchmark systems showed greater accuracy and reduced sensitivity to lag time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves the estimation of committors and transition rates, supporting robust analysis in dynamic systems.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

*Prathamesh Devadiga,Omkaar Jayadev Shetty,Pooja Agarwal*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAMVAD, a Multi-Agent System for simulating judicial deliberation in the Indian justice system using AI agents powered by large language models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome ethical and practical barriers in studying empirical judicial deliberations and to improve understanding of the fairness and efficacy of justice systems.

Method: The system involves agents simulating key judicial roles (Judge, Prosecution, Defense, etc.), using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a domain-specific legal knowledge base for realism and transparency in legal arguments.

Result: The system achieves a legally grounded and transparent simulation of the Indian justice system, featuring iterative deliberations by adjudicators to reach consensus-based verdicts.

Conclusion: SAMVAD serves as an innovative platform for simulating legal reasoning and group decision-making, enriched with verifiable and legally grounded arguments tailored to the Indian legal context.

Abstract: Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)
designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the
Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

TL;DR: Examines Uganda's public response to perceived mobile money security flaws through the #StopAirtelThefty Twitter campaign and insights into system shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the security concerns in Uganda's growing mobile money sector highlighted by public discourse.

Method: Used qualitative analysis to extract and analyze complaints from a public Twitter campaign decrying mobile money security vulnerabilities.

Result: Identified key themes of user dissatisfaction and security vulnerabilities within Uganda's mobile money systems.

Conclusion: The findings inform providers and policymakers on necessary measures to enhance digital finance security within Uganda's regulatory environment.

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile money in Uganda has been a cornerstone of
financial inclusion, yet its security mechanisms remain a critical concern.
This study investigates a significant public response to perceived security

### [330] [No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404)
*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how human decision-making aligns with racially biased AI models in hiring scenarios and explores methods to reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of AI bias on human decision-making during resume screening and explore interventions to mitigate this bias in hiring contexts.

Method: Conducting a resume-screening experiment with 528 participants collaborating with simulated AI models that exhibit varying levels of race-based bias, supported by implicit association tests.

Result: Participants adapt their selections to align with biased AI recommendations up to 90% of the time, but pre-screening interventions like IATs can reduce stereotype-driven decisions by 13%.

Conclusion: AI bias significantly influences human decision-making, but strategies like implicit bias tests can partially mitigate this effect. Policies should address AI's complex role in hiring systems to ensure fairness and accountability.

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

### [331] [Hypothesis Selection: A High Probability Conundrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03734)
*Anders Aamand,Maryam Aliakbarpour,Justin Y. Chen,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper addresses the hypothesis selection problem, aiming to efficiently identify a candidate distribution close to an unknown distribution $P$. It improves computational efficiency and explores alternative settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve key aspects of the hypothesis selection problem, including optimizing running time, sample complexity, and approximation factors, which remain unresolved despite decades of research.

Method: The authors propose algorithmic improvements to reduce runtime complexity and study hypothesis selection under alternative settings including expected distance performance, known optimal values, and preprocessing approaches.

Result: The paper improves the time complexity of prior algorithms to $	ilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$ and settles accuracy factors ($C = 3$) across diverse settings like expected distance output, known $\\mathsf{OPT}$ values, and preprocessing-enhanced models.

Conclusion: The proposed methods address foundational issues in hypothesis selection, optimizing computation and precision, while resolving or advancing multiple unresolved questions from prior works in this area.

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given a finite set of candidate
distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples
from an unknown distribution $P$. Our goal is to find a hypothesis $H_i$ whose
total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis
in $\mathcal{H}$. If the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output
an $H_i$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation
distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$.
  Despite decades of work, key aspects of this problem remain unresolved,
including the optimal running time for algorithms that achieve the optimal
sample complexity and best possible approximation factor of $C=3$. The previous
state-of-the-art result [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided a
nearly linear in $n$ time algorithm but with a sub-optimal dependence on the
other parameters, running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We
improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$,
significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.
  Furthermore, we study hypothesis selection in three alternative settings,
resolving or making progress on several open questions from prior works. (1) We
settle the optimal approximation factor when bounding the \textit{expected
distance} of the output hypothesis, rather than its high-probability
performance. (2) Assuming the numerical value of \textit{$\mathsf{OPT}$ is
known} in advance, we present an algorithm obtaining $C=3$ and runtime
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ with the optimal sample complexity and succeeding
with high probability in $n$. (3) Allowing polynomial \textit{preprocessing}
step on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ before observing samples, we present
an algorithm with $C=3$ and subquadratic runtime which succeeds with high
probability in $n$.

TL;DR: The paper derives a divergence-kernel formula for linear response of random dynamical systems and introduces a Monte-Carlo algorithm for testing a diffusion generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of determining linear responses in systems with random elements, including multiplicative and parameterized noise.

Method: Derivation of a divergence-kernel formula and transitioning to the continuous-time framework, followed by development of a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm.

Result: Linear response evaluations using a proposed diffusion generative model were tested on simple problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and algorithm are versatile and applicable without the need for hyperbolicity in random systems.

Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response
(parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random
dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula
works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it
does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm
for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative
model and test on simple problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve our understanding of protoplanetary disk evolution by resolving their complex three-dimensional structure, which traditional methods cannot achieve.

Method: A computational framework integrating physics-constrained neural fields, differentiable rendering, and RadJAX, a highly efficient GPU-accelerated radiative transfer solver.

Result: The new framework successfully recovered the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer in HD 163296, revealing previously undetected structural features such as emission surface narrowing and flattening beyond 400 au.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a new paradigm for analyzing disk structures and enhancing our comprehension of protoplanetary disk evolution through advanced computational techniques.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture
features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational
framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable
rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional
ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural
reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature
missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting
complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary

*Zheng-Meng Zhai,Valerio Lucarini,Ying-Cheng Lai*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper reveals a limitation in using sparse optimization techniques to determine governing equations for chaotic systems, showing these equations depend on measurement methods but yield similar chaotic behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of imprecise data caused by disturbances and measurement errors when modeling dynamical systems using sparse optimization.

Method: The authors compare the chaotic attractors and Koopman spectra resulting from different sets of equations derived using sparse-optimization methods.

Result: The study finds that while the equations derived depend on data measurement, they produce similar chaotic attractors; differences in Koopman spectra emerge with small eigenvalues.

Conclusion: Physical interpretation of governing equations may be misleading, advocating for direct data-driven approaches like machine learning instead.

Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a
popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering
the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and
measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used
sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models
that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models
generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking
limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling
in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the
different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the
differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an
equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing
equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to
misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the
available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.

*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces LibriQuote, a dataset for training and benchmarking expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems, featuring large-scale expressive and non-expressive speech data and a challenging test set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of expressive speech datasets suitable for training and benchmarking, and to evaluate TTS systems' ability to generate expressive and natural speech.

Method: The authors created the LibriQuote dataset with 12.7K hours of non-expressive and 5.3K hours of expressive speech, annotated with context and pseudo-labels for speech verbs and adverbs. They also included a 7.5-hour test set for benchmarking expressive TTS synthesis.

Result: Fine-tuning TTS systems on LibriQuote improved speech intelligibility, while recent systems still failed to match human-level expressiveness. The dataset was validated for its wide emotional and accent coverage.

Conclusion: LibriQuote is a valuable resource for advancing expressive TTS systems, addressing gaps in training data and providing rigorous benchmarks. It highlights the limitations of current systems while enhancing their capability with fine-tuning.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

*John Wentworth,David Lorell*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper investigates under what conditions one Bayesian agent's latent variables can be expressed as a function of another agent's latent variables, given convergence in predictive distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how latent variables learned by one Bayesian agent can relate to those learned by another is important for ensuring compatibility and communication between different generative models.

Method: The paper introduces 'natural latent conditions' and derives theorems to guarantee translatability of latent variables. Robustness of the findings to approximation errors is also examined.

Result: Simple conditions (natural latent conditions) are established as the most general constraints for guaranteeing translatability between latent variables in Bayesian models.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational insight into how latent variables across Bayesian agents can be functionally related, with implications for model compatibility even under approximation errors.

Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same
environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive
distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but
may have different generative models containing different latent variables.
Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function
of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be
possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further
constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability
is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to
approximation error in the natural latent conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel simulation-based inference (SBI) method integrating score matching with Langevin dynamics to efficiently handle moderate to high-dimensional posterior landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SBI methods struggle with efficiently addressing challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Method: The authors propose score-matching integrated with Langevin dynamics, along with tailored score-matching procedures such as localization schemes and architectural regularization to optimize inference in challenging settings.

Result: The approach demonstrates superiority on benchmark tasks and challenging moderate to high-dimensional problems, showing improved performance relative to existing SBI methods.

Conclusion: The method advances the applicability of SBI to efficiently handle complex posterior landscapes, paving the way for robust Bayesian analysis in high-dimensional contexts.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the
likelihood is intractable but model simulations are available. Recent advances
in statistics and machine learning, including Approximate Bayesian Computation
and deep generative models, have expanded the applicability of SBI, yet these
methods often face challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces.
Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian
sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with
Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in
such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for
SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an
architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of
log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide
theoretical analysis of the method and illustrate its practical benefits on
benchmark tasks and on more challenging problems in moderate to high
dimensions, where it performs favorably compared to existing approaches.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of uncertainty quantification in uplift model comparisons by proposing a two-step sampling and resampling-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the necessity to assess the performance of uplift models accurately even when entire population data is unavailable, which is common in marketing applications.

Method: The authors propose a two-step sampling procedure combined with a resampling-based method to quantify uncertainty in uplift curve estimates and enable model comparisons.

Result: The proposed method is tested through simulations and real data applications, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This study provides a systematic way to compare uplift models with quantified uncertainties, addressing a previously unexamined issue in the field.

Abstract: Uplift models play a critical role in modern marketing applications to help
understand the incremental benefits of interventions and identify optimal
targeting strategies. A variety of techniques exist for building uplift models,
and it is essential to understand the model differences in the context of
intended applications. The uplift curve is a widely adopted tool for assessing
uplift model performance on the selection universe when observations are
available for the entire population. However, when it is uneconomical or
infeasible to select the entire population, it becomes difficult or even
impossible to estimate the uplift curve without appropriate sampling design. To
the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed uncertainty
quantification of uplift curve estimates, which is essential for model
comparisons. We propose a two-step sampling procedure and a resampling-based
approach to compare uplift models with uncertainty quantification, examine the
proposed method via simulations and real data applications, and conclude with a
discussion.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing large language models (LLMs) to enhance Bayesian modeling for adverse event analysis in clinical trials, reducing patient requirements while improving predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical trials require substantial patient involvement and resources, driving the need for methods that minimize patient numbers without compromising statistical power. Existing approaches lack efficient means to incorporate external clinical expertise systematically.

Method: The framework uses pre-trained LLMs to generate parametric prior distributions for hierarchical Bayesian models. Informative priors are elicited for hyperparameters, integrating external knowledge into Bayesian safety modeling. The effectiveness is tested through temperature sensitivity analysis and real-world data cross-validation.

Result: The inclusion of LLM-derived priors improves predictive performance consistently over traditional meta-analytical approaches when applied to clinical trial data.

Conclusion: The methodology offers a transformative approach to clinical trial design by reducing participant requirements while ensuring robust safety assessments. This has significant potential for advancing drug safety monitoring and regulatory decisions.

Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the
same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language
models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling
of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed
prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate
synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from
the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for
hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM,
enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into
Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity
analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we
demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance
compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the
way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling
substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust
safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring
and regulatory decision making.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal algorithm, which allows uncertainty quantification in solving ODEs and PDEs using Gaussian processes (GPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a probabilistic method that extends the capabilities of existing Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solvers while enabling uncertainty quantification in the context of solving differential equations.

Method: The proposed method uses Gaussian processes to model the Parareal correction function, propagate numerical uncertainties, and accommodate probabilistic initial conditions. Additionally, it includes a variant called Prob-nnGParareal, which integrates nearest-neighbors GPs for enhanced performance.

Result: The Prob-GParareal algorithm is theoretically analyzed for computational complexity and error bounds. Numerical experiments show its accuracy and robustness on five benchmark ODE systems and one PDE example, including chaotic and stiff systems.

Conclusion: The study introduces a probabilistic PinT algorithm that seamlessly integrates with classical solvers, filling a significant gap in the field and offering a scalable and flexible approach for uncertainty quantification in differential equations.

Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal
algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the
Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential
equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model
the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the
propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic
forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates
probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical
numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing
Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the
computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we
numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm
on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation
problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed
algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing
the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased
performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in
the development of probabilistic counterparts to established PinT methods.

Method: The authors base ASVGD on an accelerated gradient flow in the probability density space, incorporating Nesterov's method for momentum-based updates and Wasserstein metric regularization for stability.

Result: ASVGD demonstrates optimal convergence rates for certain kernels and outperforms SVGD in Bayesian neural network settings through improved log-likelihood and reduced iteration times.

Conclusion: ASVGD emerges as a promising sampling approach, combining the advantages of SVGD with enhanced speed and efficiency, suitable for high-dimensional machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and
non-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as
in Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other
particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the
gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to
score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient
high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce
accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric
space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a
momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of
particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we
also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the
conference version \cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target
distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an
optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by
analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.
Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on
the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel
functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target
distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other
popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian
neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of
log-likelihood and total iteration times.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper reviews the evolution of assignment problems from classical theories to modern optimal transport (OT) and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) frameworks, proposing new solvers and strategies to tackle constraints in real-world matching scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend assignment problem strategies to accommodate complex matching tasks across different domains, while optimizing for computational efficiency and solution accuracy in scenarios where classical methods falter.

Method: This study bridges classical assignment algorithms and modern OT frameworks, leveraging GW distances and proposing advanced solutions like GW-MultiInit and entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations.

Result: GW-MultiInit achieves near-optimal solutions for capacitated QAP instances and scales efficiently for larger problems, with EGW and FGW variants providing adaptable trade-offs between runtime and accuracy.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the theoretical and practical applicability of OT and GW models to tackle QAP-like problems efficiently, offering guidance for diverse tasks across machine learning and logistics domains.

Abstract: The assignment problem, a cornerstone of operations research, seeks an
optimal one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks to minimize total cost.
This work traces its evolution from classical formulations and algorithms to
modern optimal transport (OT) theory, positioning the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP) and related structural matching tasks within this framework. We
connect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,
Kantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where
source and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW
variant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address
QAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances
and cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint
correspondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed
multi-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting
stuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and
fused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that
GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales
efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while
parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy
and runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational
insights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and
other real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and
logistics.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical convergence estimates for shuffling methods in variational inequalities, showing faster convergence compared to independent data sampling through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of theoretical guarantees for shuffling methods, which are widely used in variational inequalities but had not been rigorously analyzed.

Method: The authors analyze shuffling heuristics by establishing convergence bounds and rates for these methods in the context of variational inequalities.

Result: The paper demonstrates faster convergence rates of shuffling methods over independent sampling techniques, supported by theoretical analysis and experiments on benchmark problems.

Conclusion: Shuffling methods are validated as a practical and efficient alternative in solving variational inequalities, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine
learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these
problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an
alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves
permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal
consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical
guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We
address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for
shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and
convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class
of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on
diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster
convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.
