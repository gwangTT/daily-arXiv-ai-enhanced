While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing\ntools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those\ntools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that\neffectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging\nthe correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we\nadapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model\nwithin-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing\nattack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.\nThrough a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the\neffectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional\ncomputational costs.
