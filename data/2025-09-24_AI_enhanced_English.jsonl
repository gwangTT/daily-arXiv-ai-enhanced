This paper introduces\nSimilarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the\nprinciples governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We\ndefine: (1) a similarity field $S: U \\times U \\to [0,1]$ over a universe of\nentities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed\nrelational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the\nevolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by\n$p=0,1,2,\\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers\n$F_{\\alpha}(K) = { E \\in U \\mid S(E,K) \\ge \\alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of\nthe unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that\nproduces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative\ndefinition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a\nconcept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of\n$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field\nTheory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and\nconstructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks\nmutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or\neventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the\nevolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,\nculminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large\nlanguage models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory as a mathematical framework for understanding dynamic systems through similarity relations among entities, focusing on their evolution and generative intelligence.", "motivation": "The authors aim to create a mathematical foundation to analyze and interpret dynamic systems and intelligent processes through similarity relationships between entities.", "method": "The authors define a similarity field over a set of entities, investigate the evolution of these fields, propose the concept of fibers to categorize entities, and introduce a generative operator $G$ to define intelligence.

Preprint submitted to a CVF conference", "summary": "Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from\ncollections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many\nreal-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only\nthe test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by\nproposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the\ninductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior\n(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key\nassumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,\nand that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or\nstochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based\ntraining framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for\nself-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in\nDIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,\npatch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual\nloss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel\nfidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,\nand remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves\n0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the\nfabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

To address this\nchallenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed\nto quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.\nThe benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level\ncognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,\nUnderstanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were\nderived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to\nspecialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset\nencompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted\nprimarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.\nFurthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable\nand consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses\nleveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear\nperformance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite\ndemonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization\nand Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,\nparticularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing\ncomplex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.\nConsequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and\ndevelopment aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into\nsafety-critical engineering practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces AECBench, a benchmark that evaluates the robustness and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) domain, revealing performance declines at higher cognitive levels.", "motivation": "To address the challenge of assessing LLMs in a safety-critical domain like Architecture, Engineering, and Construction, and ensure their reliable application in such contexts.", "method": "The study created AECBench with 23 representative tasks across five cognitive levels, developed a 4,800-question dataset derived from actual AEC practice, and utilized an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for evaluating complex responses.", "result": "Nine LLMs were tested, showing proficiency in basic tasks but significant performance deficits in higher cognitive tasks, such as reasoning, calculation, and specialized document generation.", "conclusion": "This work provides a foundation for future advancements in integrating LLMs into critical engineering tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in their capabilities."}}

In this paper, we\nexamine the potential of using D-Wave Systems' quantum annealing solvers to\nsolve the Minimum Bisection Problem, which we formulate as a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization model. A key challenge in this formulation\nlies in choosing an appropriate penalty parameter, as it plays a crucial role\nin ensuring both the quality of the solution and the satisfaction of the\nproblem's constraints. To address this, we introduce a novel machine\nlearning-based approach for adaptive tuning of the penalty parameter.\nSpecifically, we use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model trained to predict\nsuitable penalty parameter values based on structural properties of the input\ngraph, the number of nodes and the graph's density. This method enables the\npenalty parameter to be adjusted dynamically for each specific problem\ninstance, improving the solver's ability to balance the competing goals of\nminimizing the cut size and maintaining equally sized partitions.
