In this work, microscopic\nimages of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we\nautomate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations\nof spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine\nlearning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and\ndirections within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an\nemergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate\nhigh-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract\nlatent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation\nerrors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification\nand prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively\ncorrelating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images.
